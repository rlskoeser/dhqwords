_DHQwords_ is a mashup of [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/) (_Digital Humanities Quarterly_) and [_Startwords_](https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/).  

Articles from _DHQ_ have been converted from TEI XML to markdown for publication as Hugo site using the _Startwords_ theme.

_Startwords_ is a research periodical irregularly published by the [Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton](https://cdh.princeton.edu). Read more [about _Startwords_ editorial and technical work](https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/about/).
