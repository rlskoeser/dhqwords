Drucker goes further in stating, “Nothing in intellectual life is self-evident or self-identical, nothing in cultural life is mere fact, and nothing in the phenomenal world gives rise to a record or representation except through constructed expressions” <a class=footnote-ref href=#drucker2011>[drucker2011] </a>. Drucker lays out a lexical argument between data and capta that more or less parallels the realist and constructivist modalities of thought as she describes them (i.e., data suggests realism and capta suggests constructivism).<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><p>In this piece, I want to argue in favor of embracing some of Drucker’s points about humanistic inquiry while simultaneously arguing against capta as a term to be used in place of data. As a humanist, I do see value in emphasizing that data are taken and not given, but I believe there is a richer etymological narrative, and a richer history of the worddatain English, to be described. There is also the more complicated question of whether all forms of empiricism require proceeding “as if the phenomenal world were self-evident,” and the degree to which social constructions mediate our experiences and understanding of the world. I will gesture at these larger questions in this essay, but my primary concern is with how scholars in digital humanities should approach conversations about data.</p><p>The bulk of my essay is a revised and expanded etymology for the termsdataandcapta, which considers their Latin roots, as well as the close ties of the worddatato the publishing history of <em>Euclidis Data</em> (1625) and subsequent translations and editions of that work. Euclid’s own use of the termgivenwas a subject for discussion and debate, as was the degree to which his use ofgivenresembled other Greeks’ use of the term. A fully fleshed out history of the termdatain English includes its use in two related but distinct senses: geometrical and empirical, the latter of these emerging from the prior. To appreciate the difference between these senses, we must understand the degree to which early modern thinkers synthesized geometrical and numerical thought into what is now regarded as the singular discipline of mathematics. Further, these thinkers adapted and extended mathematical thinking to translate observations of or measurements from the natural world into generalizations and explanatory systems.</p><p>In the closing section of this essay, I will turn to the benefits of embracing concepts such as situated data over capta. Such an approach allows humanists to contest oversimplifications of poorly executed data-driven inquiry and simultaneously to create more opportunities for conversation with other disciplines. The tone of these conversations could be positively affected, as well, with digital humanities speaking and listening in equal proportion. Lastly, I will discuss the new possibilities that this rhetorical shift could create for how we teach data analysis, which has the potential to advance digital humanities as a discipline.</p><h2 id=druckers-conceptual-and-terminological-intervention>Drucker’s Conceptual and Terminological Intervention</h2><p>My response to Drucker begins with a certain degree of uncertainty about how “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” has been received in digital humanities. Generally, I take it to have made a strong, positive impression. Drucker was not the first scholar to point out thatcaptamight be a more appropriate term thandata, but her work is arguably the most influential to make this point, especially in digital humanities.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> This essay, or the corresponding material in Drucker’s book <em>Graphesis</em> (2014), is widely referenced in digital humanities, and I have seen it listed on many DH course syllabi.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> There appear to have been numerous conference presentations, blog posts, and discussions of capta on social media. In various contexts, public displays of one’s agreement with Drucker might take the form of statements like, “There is no such thing as data. There are only capta. ” <sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> Broadly speaking, Drucker has set the terms of the debate on the subject of data and capta, and this influence has been both descriptive and normative. Simultaneously, I have not seen signs of a large-scale movement to purge documents of the worddata, nor have the wordcaptaor its cognates become especially prevalent in digital humanities scholarship.<sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup></p><p>One might argue that Drucker makes a conceptual intervention and not a terminological one. I would concede that the essay is most concerned with reconceptualizing data as capta, and the importance of such a shift. With regard to data visualization, Drucker argues that “the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original interpretative framework on which the statistical data were constructed” <a class=footnote-ref href=#drucker2011>[drucker2011] </a>. Data do not “pre-exist their parameterization” because they are “constructed as an interpretation of the phenomenal world, not inherent in it” <a class=footnote-ref href=#drucker2011>[drucker2011] </a>. Drucker does not explicitly argue that humanities scholars should never say or write the worddata, but she does claim that “all data is capta” nd that because of the etymological roots of the terms,capta “is taken actively while  data  is assumed to be a given able to be recorded and observed” <a class=footnote-ref href=#drucker2011>[drucker2011] </a>. As a result, I reject the idea that one can so easily separate Drucker’s conceptual intervention from the terminological one supporting it.</p><p>Another way of looking at Drucker’s influence would be to say that there is widespread agreement with her views on data and capta, but practical considerations outweigh other concerns. Such practical considerations include (1) maximizing clarity for particular audiences, (2) limits on space that would make it difficult to explain the choice to usecapta, and (3) the question of how to invoke concepts like big data, data visualization, databases, datasets, metadata, and open data. One might attempt to stake out a rhetorical middle position by mentioning that data are really capta and to proceed with the worddatathereafter, as Rob Kitchin does in <em>The Data Revolution: Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures and Their Consequences</em> (2014). Kitchin adds, “since the term data has been so thoroughly ingrained to mean capta, rather than confuse the matter further it makes sense to continue to use the term data where capta would be more appropriate” <a class=footnote-ref href=#kitchin2014>[kitchin2014] </a>. This seems like it would be an appealing option for many people, and I suspect it is widespread, although I have not investigated this question in any serious way.</p><p>Regardless, I am aware of no published work that disputes Drucker’s core points. That is:<br>the worddataconnotes something given andreconceptualizing data as capta is integral to rejecting realist assumptions of transparency and equivalence between data and the phenomena they purport to represent.</p><h2 id=a-revised-and-expanded-etymology-for-data-and-capta>A Revised and Expanded Etymology for Data and Capta</h2><p>In direct response to Drucker, I hope to demonstrate that the worddatadoes not assume a given that can be transparently and unproblematically recorded and observed. If this first point can be satisfactorily established, it should follow that one can say and write the worddata, embrace “the situated, partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production,” and recognize that “knowledge is constructed,  <em>taken</em> , not simply given as a natural representation of pre-existing fact” <a class=footnote-ref href=#drucker2011>[drucker2011] </a>. This line of reasoning is crucial to how digital humanists understand and talk about the concept of data, as well as how we teach computational methods. However, making such an argument first requires revisiting the origin ofdataas a term of use in English and discussing how the meaning of the termdatahas changed over time.</p><p>To begin, the worddataindeed comes from the Latin forgiven,but the etymology of the English language word is less straightforward than Drucker suggests. A more detailed account of “the early history of the concept of data ” is Daniel Rosenberg’s “Data Before the Fact” (2013), which discusses much of the early history of data’s English usage. As Rosenberg describes, “In English, data was first used in the seventeenth century. Yet it is not wrong to associate the emergence of the concept and that of modernity. The rise of the concept in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is tightly linked to the development of modern concepts of knowledge and argumentation” <a class=footnote-ref href=#rosenberg2013>[rosenberg2013] </a>. Rosenberg emphasizes the “specifically rhetorical” status of the worddataas something both “pre-analytical” and “pre-factual,” more so even than the related concepts offactsandevidence<a class=footnote-ref href=#rosenberg2013> [rosenberg2013] </a>. As he further explains, “When a fact is proven false, it ceases to be a fact. False data is data nonetheless” <a class=footnote-ref href=#rosenberg2013>[rosenberg2013] </a>. Rosenberg’s telling of the early history of data in English adequately distinguishes between the two earliest senses of the termdata, the first in “the realm of mathematics, where it retained the technical sense that it has in Euclid, as quantities <em>given</em> in mathematical problems, as opposed to the quaesita , or quantities <em>sought</em> ” and the second “in the realm of theology, where it referred to scriptural truths — whether principles or facts — that were given by God and therefore not susceptible to questioning” <a class=footnote-ref href=#rosenberg2013>[rosenberg2013] </a>. However, I want to argue that these two senses are more closely related than one might first assume, and there is a third early sense of the word that Rosenberg does not fully distinguish.</p><p>First, the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> provides an entry for data as “something given or granted; something known or assumed as fact, and made the basis of reasoning; an assumption or premise from which inferences are drawn” <a class=footnote-ref href=#oed2020c>[oed2020c] </a>. We might call thisdata in the geometrical sense.This phrasing is intended to echo Rosenberg’s definition, except for the distinction that our contemporary concept of mathematics depends on a synthesis of geometrical and numerical paradigms of thought that had not yet fully unfolded in Europe circa 1600.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup> The story of the data’s entry into English must include some history of the translation of Euclid’s work from Greek to Latin and English, a story Rosenberg alludes to but does not detail in full. The Greek word δεδομένα (dedoména) meansgiven.Δεδομένα (Dedoména) is the title of a work by Euclid, which remains extant in manuscript form in Greek and Arabic. It was translated into Latin by the French mathematician Claude Hardy and printed alongside its original Greek as a volume titled <em>Euclidis Data</em> in 1625. An English translation with the title <em>Euclid’s Data</em> was included with an edition of <em>Euclid’s Elements of Geometry</em> (John Leeke & George Serle) in 1661.<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup> The <em>OED</em> traces this sense of the worddatato Henry Hammond’s <em>A copy of some papers past at Oxford, betwixt the author of the Practicall catechisme, and Mr. Ch.</em> in 1646<a class=footnote-ref href=#oed2020c> [oed2020c] </a>, which refers to “a heape of data,” but, as Rosenberg states, this heap “is not a pile of numbers but a list of theological propositions accepted as true for the sake of argument” <a class=footnote-ref href=#rosenberg2013>[rosenberg2013] </a>. It may seem counter-intuitive to associate the Greek-to-Latin geometrical usage ofdatawith what Jonathan Furner calls “data as gifts from God,” but the theological or ecclesiastical notion of data is a direct antecedent of how Euclid used the termdata/dedoména<a class=footnote-ref href=#furner2016> [furner2016] </a>. Furner elaborates that such uses go back to Thomas Tuke’s <em>Nevv Essayes</em> of 1614, and that the Latin worddatais found in other Latin phrases in “religious texts of early seventeenth-century England — for example, gratia gratis data ( grace freely given ), and data desuper ( given from above )” <a class=footnote-ref href=#furner2016>[furner2016] </a>. Like Rosenberg, Furner differentiates betweendatain the geometrical sense anddatain the ecclesiastical sense, but they both owe their meaning to a fairly literal translation of the Latin word as “given.”</p><p>Quite different from this first cluster is what we might call “data in the empirical sense.” The <em>OED</em> refers to datum “chiefly in plural” (i.e., data), which describes “an item of (chiefly numerical) information obtained by scientific work, a number of which are typically collected together for reference, analysis, or calculation” with first use listed as 1630<a class=footnote-ref href=#oed2020c> [oed2020c] </a>.<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup> This sense of the word seems to relate to the <em>OED</em> ’s entry for data “as a count noun: an item of information; a datum; a set of data” (first use listed as 1645) and later, as “a mass noun,” meaning “related items of (chiefly numerical) information considered collectively, typically obtained by scientific work and used for reference, analysis, or calculation” with its first use listed as 1702<a class=footnote-ref href=#oed2020c> [oed2020c] </a>.<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup> There are likely examples of historic usage where data appears to be something in between the geometrical sense and the empirical sense, but the difference between the two in their sharpest forms is quite significant, and assuming the associations of the first sense carry over to the second sense would be a mistake. To better understand the dissimilarities between these senses, we must reexamine the first English translation of Euclid’s <em>Data</em> .</p><p>How Euclid had useddedoména/datais the subject of a commentary by Marinus of Neapolis, translated and included in Leeke and Serle’s edition, for “the Ancients have defined it in one manner, and later Writers after another” <a class=footnote-ref href=#marinus1661>[marinus1661] </a>. For Marinus, the question was whether Euclid’s notion of data could be defined as a combination ofordinatum(regulated or orderly) andporiman(available or provided) or as a combination ofcognitum(infamous or known) andporimon. Marinus’ two candidate definitions may appear to map directly to the English language senses of geometrical data and empirical data, but this is not the case. Neither of Marinus’ notions would have been used as a term to describe aspects of the natural world, only for abstractions like the following:<br>The length of a line C when line C equals the length of line A minus the length of line B, and the lengths of lines A and B are both given.The length of line Z connecting two points A and B, when the positions of points A and B are given.</p><p>Drawing on examples from Euclid and other ancient texts, Marinus concludes that Euclid is referring to data as a combination ofporimon, “that which may be exhibited by Demonstration, or which is apparent without Demonstration” andcognitum, that which is “clear and comprehended of us” <a class=footnote-ref href=#marinus1661>[marinus1661] </a>. However, his recognition of a second candidate definition, describing data as a combination ofordinatumandporimanshould be noted, as it could point to others forming a similar impression.</p><p>More recently, Christian Taisbak notes that Euclid’s use of the worddatameans both the clear and comprehended premise, and the demonstrated conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>When I started to translate the <em>Data</em> , I found it very longwinded that a certain phrase kept popping up time and again, several times in every proposition: <em>if this item is given, that item is</em> also <em>given</em> . I decided to cancel all those <em>alsos</em> and restore them only where they were absolutely necessary. But then I discovered that I was leaving out an essential feature of the <em>Data</em> : the Givens hang together in chains, the purpose of any proposition being to produce more links to them.<br><a class=footnote-ref href=#taisbak2003>[taisbak2003] </a>Taisbak is essentially describing deductive reasoning, “that if some items are given, some other items are also given, <em>into the bargain</em> so to speak” <a class=footnote-ref href=#taisbak2003>[taisbak2003] </a>. For Euclid,dedoménareferred “not only to the input of a problem, but also to the output” <a class=footnote-ref href=#taisbak2003>[taisbak2003] </a>. In this context, one might also compare Euclid’s use ofdatatoakolouthia(ἀκολουθία), a term favored by Aristotle and others, which “indicates the necessary relationship between two propositions when one of them is the consequence of the other” <a class=footnote-ref href=#seco2010>[seco2010] </a>).<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup> This perspective complicates Rosenberg’s gloss ofdataas quantities given andquaesitaas quantities sought, since quantities sought can in fact become given through demonstration or deduction (ὅπερ ἔδει δεῖξαι /hóper édei deîxai).<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup> These nuances remain specific to the geometrical rather than the empirical concept of data that I have so far discussed, but they are important aspects of the history of the termdata, as well as the history of how that term became associated with quantitative reasoning. As a result, these details already suggest the beginnings of a pedagogical intervention in digital humanities, where thegiven-nessof data is more complex that it might initially appear.</p></blockquote><p>Data in the empirical sense appears to draw upon aspects of data as a geometrical given and extend these qualities to features of the natural world. For the likes of Apollonius, Euclid, and Marinus, the concept of data would never imply collecting information in this way. Observations of the sort said to be described in Eratosthenes’ <em>Γεωγραφία</em> ( <em>Geografíka</em> ), would be called φαινόμενο (fainómeno), orphenomenon,which translates to “that which appears or is seen.” <sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup> Phenomena included anything that appeared to be true, such as illusions, mirages, and dreams. James Evans and J. Lennart Berggren explain that “the word phenomena is a participle of the passive verb phanomai , which carries the meanings of to come to light, come to sight, be seen, appear. ” They add, “The last two are definitive for the astronomical sense of the word, which is things that are seen/appear in the heavens ” <a class=footnote-ref href=#evans2018>[evans2018] </a>. An entire genre of Greek philosophical thought was dedicated to the idea that, from careful observation of the heavens, one could understand the positions of the earth, the planets, and the stars, as well as explain the circular motions of all celestial bodies. Hence the notion, originating in Greek astronomy, of σωζειν τα φαινόμενα (sozein ta fainómena) or “save the phenomena” <a class=footnote-ref href=#heath1921>[heath1921] </a>. Works within this genre included Euclid’s <em>The Phenomena</em> , Autolykos’ <em>On the Moving Sphere</em> , Aristotle’s <em>On the Heavens</em> , Gemino’s <em>Introduction to the Phenomena</em> , and Theodesius’ <em>Sphaerics</em> , which is thought to extend the work of Eudoxos. Contributions to this genre continued into the Middle Ages.</p><p>These writers did not appear to distinguish between their observations and the way they were structured or recorded. Much later, the genre ofAlmanack of EphemerisorEphemeridesseems to suggest a potential term that makes this distinction. The earliest use of the termalmanac, meaning “an annual table, or (more usually) a book of tables,” can be traced to <em>The Equatorie of the Planetis</em>  (circa CE 1392), whereas the term <em>ephemeris</em> was used as early as the mid-16th century<a class=footnote-ref href=#oed2020a> [oed2020a] </a>. According to Arthur L. Norberg, an almanac of ephemeris, by the nineteenth century, “contained information on the phenomena for that year: eclipses of the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter’s satellites; the orientation of Saturn’s rings and the apparent discs of Venus and Mars” <a class=footnote-ref href=#campbell-kelly2003>[campbell-kelly2003] </a>. For whatever reason, neither of these terms caught on as a more generalized word for the kind of structured information one might generate by making and recording observations. As with Taisbak’s point about givens, for Euclid, functioning as the inputs and outputs of problems, the seeds of a pedagogical intervention are here planted. Phenomena were recorded and published with the expectation that future observations might supplement, refine, or replace previous ones, which suggests a fundamental awareness that representations of phenomena were partial and imperfect. Certainly, at almost any moment in history, some were expressing their belief in a unified, coherent reality just beyond our reach, as well as their confidence that their tabulations would allow them to decipher its governing dynamics. I will return to this subject in this essay’s conclusion but, for now, it should suffice to say that this belief is best understood not as a position on the distinguishing properties of data, but rather a position on the possibility of obtaining objective knowledge through empirical means.</p><p>It is also crucial to note that the idea of a table as a textual and material device for structuring numerical information is at least 4,500 years old. According to Martin Campbell Kelly and his co-authors, “While the list has been hailed as a major breakthrough in cognitive history&mldr;the table as a pre-modern phenomenon of structured thought has been completely neglected” <a class=footnote-ref href=#campbell-kelly2003>[campbell-kelly2003] </a>. In ancient Sumer, Babylonia, and Assyria, clay tablets were often if not primarily a repository of numerical information, often used as a memorization or calculation aid. Etymologically, the wordtablecomes from the Latintabula, which in turn, originates with the Greek termτάβλι(tabla), meaning a plank or board<a class=footnote-ref href=#austin1934> [austin1934] </a>. The term was used to refer to a particular board game that is thought to be the ancestor of backgammon, and was also a general term for a tablet, a slate, or any flat piece of wood. In English, it eventually a particular piece of furniture “on which food is served, and at or around which people sit at a meal” (circa CE 1300). The English wordtablemeaning “a schematic arrangement of information” or “an orderly arrangement of particulars” can be traced as far back as Byrhtferth of Ramsey’s <em>Enchiridion</em> (CE 986-1016), but the association between a tablet/slate and structured information recorded upon it appears to be much older<a class=footnote-ref href=#oed2020e> [oed2020e] </a>.</p><p>Today, the phrasetabular datasuggests a strong association between tables and data, and the termobservationis widely used to denote “all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes” or, in the context of rectangular data, a row of values.<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup> As Lisa Gitelman notes, the idea of converting that which one observes into data — a conceptual object that structures and represents that which has been perceived — seems like second nature to us. “When phenomena are variously reduced to data, they are divided and classified, processes that work to obscure — or <em>as if</em> to obscure — ambiguity, conflict, and contradiction” <a class=footnote-ref href=#gitelman2013>[gitelman2013] </a>. For Gitelman, this relationship suggests both a dependency on hierarchy, and a kind of epistemological cover that protects “users who perform logical operations on the data&mldr;from having to know how the data have been organized” <a class=footnote-ref href=#gitelman2013>[gitelman2013] </a>. When terms likedata-drivenare invoked, there is often an assumption of order, imposed or revealed, by those engaging in analysis.</p><p>Nevertheless, the idea of ordering and standardizing information for the purposes of facilitating numerical operations is much older than the English worddata. What seems to have changed is that the termdataadopted a secondary meaning in addition to the geometrical sense of term associated with Euclid. An entry in Ephraim Chambers’ <em>Cyclopædia</em> (1728) offers two definitions for the termdata. First, it continued to refer to a geometrical given. Second, “From the primary Use of the Word <em>Data</em> in mathematicks, it has been transplanted into other Arts; as Philosophy, Medicine, &amp;c. where it expresses any Quantity, which for the Sake of a present Calculation, is taken for granted to be such, without requiring an immediate Proof for its Certainty” <a class=footnote-ref href=#chambers1728>[chambers1728] </a>. According to Chambers, data had come to be used to describe a quantity, in a wide range of contexts, that was meant to be treated as a given for the purposes of analysis. This definition reinforces the distinction between data in the strictly geometrical sense and data in other contexts, and it is compatible with religious uses of the term, since information from scripture would qualify as data of the geometrical sort, or knowledge beyond question.</p><p>This explanation does not describe a specific process by which phenomena become data. However, the clausefor the Sake of a present calculationseems to limit why and how the data are permitted to be taken for granted, which undercuts the idea that data would be regarded as natural or pre-existing facts. In turn, it contradicts the idea that data in this sense could ever be viewed as pre-factual, as Rosenberg describes. Among the natural philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, the idea that Nature would reveal its hidden structure or laws to those who spoke its language was predominant.<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup> In this light, it seems likely if not obvious that empirical observations would be considered facts given by God. However, if data were available or provided because Nature had provided them for us to analyze, then there would be no need for Chambers’ qualifying phrase. The entry in Chambers’ <em>Cyclopædia</em> seems more compatible with the idea that phenomena become data, or are granted provisional status as data, which suspends the need for “an immediate proof” and permits calculation to occur.<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup></p><p>Returning to Marinus’ two candidate definitions for Euclid’s notion of data — asporimonpluscognitumorporimonplusordinatum— we can see a case for either or both.<sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup> Imposing Marinus’ analysis on Chambers’ definition is potentially problematic, but I would argue that our contemporary use of the termdatais best explained by starting with the notion of data asporimonplusordinatum. Recall that this sense — as a combination of something provided in a way that gives it order — was <em>not</em> the sense Euclid was not using, according to Marinus. As Taisbak notes, however,ordinatumfor Marinus was the Greek word τεταγμένων (tetagmenon), literallyfixed,but also used to mean “organized according to some <em>taxis</em> , order ” <a class=footnote-ref href=#taisbak2003>[taisbak2003] </a>. Regarding the Latinporimon, the Greek term πορίσαοθαι (porizesthai), Taisbak explains that Euclid uses the term to describe “several operations,” includingput together,draw,describe,make,orproduce<a class=footnote-ref href=#taisbak2003> [taisbak2003] </a>.<sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup> By this logic, definingdataas bothporimonandordinatumwould emphasize its being available, collected, or made, as well as being brought to order or revealed to have latent order by the act of demonstration.</p><p>Broadly speaking, then, a full-fledged etymology of the termdatasuggests a narrative much more complex than data asgivenand capta astaken.The Latin word forgivenwas used by Euclid in a manner very different from how data was used by the mid-18th century, and the true meaning of the Euclidian concept of dedoména/data has disputed definitions among classical thinkers, as Marinus summarizes. Concepts such as saving the phenomena, an almanac of ephemeris, and tabular information suggest an ancient and longstanding tradition of making precise observations, placing them a structured format, and using that structure to facilitate calculation. Taking Chambers into account, it seems likely that facts became eligible to be regarded as data by being provided or made available by a person or group of people who had made observations or measurements, and then imposed some form of order or structure upon them in order to facilitate analysis. Drucker’s advocacy for capta as a key term and a guiding principle is rooted in the notion that the termdataassumes a pre-existing given that can be naively recorded without being shaped by the observer. The story I have told suggests a more nuanced history of data, both as a term and a concept. There is room to embrace the worddataand understand data to be inevitably fragmentary, imperfect, and tentative, yet simultaneously useful in their ability to organize knowledge and facilitate modes of analysis that would otherwise be impossible. In the section that follows, I will make the case for embracing concepts like situated data and data-rich literary history to convey this message, which includes potential benefits to scholarly discourse and digital humanities pedagogy.</p><h2 id=situating-data-for-the-sake-of-interdisciplinarity-and-digital-humanities-pedagogy>Situating Data for the Sake of Interdisciplinarity and Digital Humanities Pedagogy</h2><p>Up to now, I have attempted to show that the termdatahas a much more nuanced history that its translation to the English wordgiven. This revised etymology leaves room for an understanding of both the term and concept as less closely linked to naive realism than Drucker suggests. As S.I. Hayakawa once famously wrote, “the writer of a dictionary is a historian, not a lawgiver” <a class=footnote-ref href=#hayakawa1990>[hayakawa1990] </a>. The meaning ofdatahas changed over time and, at any given time, no singular meaning for the term was universal. I have pointed to one important sea change, by which data came to have special prominence in the context of empiricism. A longer essay could say much more on the subject of additional changes in prevailing notions of the term, or additional meanings that persist in specific contexts or among specialized groups. Along with the accepted range of definitions fordata, their various connotations and their preferred rhetorical uses, have also changed over time. I think Drucker is right to point out that many today use the termdatato suggest a kind unimpeachable concreteness rather than something partly born out of the assumptions made when selecting and organizing said data. I suspect that there is widespread disagreement among self-proclaimed empiricists about the degree to which data arenatural representationsas opposed to “situated, partial, and constitutive,” but I agree that scientific rhetoric often downplays or denies the artificial, conditional, and fragmentary aspects of data<a class=footnote-ref href=#drucker2011> [drucker2011] </a>.</p><p>As an alternative to avoiding the termdata, I would argue that digital humanities should focus on challenging and complicating beliefs about the purity, objectivity, or totality of data, all the while using the worddatafrequently, and without any shame. There is a strong defense for using the worddatamindfully and unapologetically based on the understanding that data are collected, assembled, and recorded by people (or their instruments). Data have structure, but this structure comes (at least in part) from how observations are gathered and organized, as well as shaped by the interpretive decisions made at their inception. Contextual information about these interpretive decisions is a vital component of a dataset. Many in digital humanities have already moved in this direction, shifting from notions ofgood dataandbad datato concepts like data as situated knowledge, as described in Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein’s <em>Data Feminism</em> (2020) or data-rich literary history as described in Katherine Bode’s <em>A World of Fiction: Digital Collections and the Future of Literary History</em> (2019). The benefits of these strategies are both discursive and pedagogical.</p><p>The first benefit of this approach is to move away from an argument based on word origin. A word’s origins seldom tell an accurate story of a word’s historical use or contemporary valences. There are numerous Latin words with English homographs, and often their meanings have changed over time. Words such asplastic,stigma,campus,focus,versus,stimulus,andsinisterall have Latin antecedents with meanings that differ greatly from their contemporary use in English. With the worddata, there is added ambiguity because the English wordgivenhas more than one meaning. Describing an idea asa givenora warrantin the context of a rhetorical argument remains common, and seems to carry no implication of pre-factualness or ineligible for questioning.<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup></p><p>Capta, likewise, is Latin for taken and therefore has a certain surface appeal as a mirror term for data. However, capta can also meancaught,captured,andcaptive.The phraseJudæa captarefers to the siege and capture of Jerusalem by the Romans, as well as a series of coins issued by the Roman Emperor Vespasian to celebrate these actions<a class=footnote-ref href=#elizabeth1845> [elizabeth1845] </a>. In the Roman Empire, the phrasesmanu capta<a class=footnote-ref href=#sandars1917> [sandars1917] </a>andpraeda manu captadenoted that which wascaptured by handoracquired by force of handsfrom among Rome’s enemies.<sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup> Further, some enslaved people (servi) were “so called from the fact that commanders are used to <em>sell</em> their captives, and by this means to <em>preserve</em> (servare) rather than kill them” ( <em>Justinian Institutes</em> , qtd. in<a href=#cameron1972>Cameron (1972), 5</a>).<sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup> These potential associations are important because they complicate the idea that data straightforwardly means <em>given</em> and capta straightforwardly means <em>taken</em> as we think of those terms today. Moreover, these examples underscore the broader point that it can be a mistake to use a word’s denotation in its language of origin (or its historic denotation in English) as the primary criteria by which to judge its contemporary meaning or appeal.</p><p>Denotations, connotations, and rhetorical uses change over time, and this is good news. Such associations can change once again, and scholars of the humanities can help change them. As Helen Longino has argued, the notion of objectivity in scientific inquiry is bound up in two different senses of the term, the first emphasizing scientific realism, or the idea that science provides an “accurate description of the facts of the world as they are” <a class=footnote-ref href=#longino1990>[longino1990] </a>. The second, associated with modes of inquiry, stresses “reliance on nonarbitrary and nonsubjective criteria for developing, accepting, and rejecting the hypotheses and theories that make up the view” <a class=footnote-ref href=#longino1990>[longino1990] </a>. Further, scientists will often “speak of the objectivity of data” but objectivity in this sense should be taken as a claim of reliability<a class=footnote-ref href=#longino1990> [longino1990] </a>. What makes data objective is “the relationship of measurements to one another within a particular dimension or kind of scale” <a class=footnote-ref href=#longino1990>[longino1990] </a>. According to Longino, it should not be assumed that these measures “are real properties of real entities” or “that their measurements provide us with an unmediated view of the natural world” <a class=footnote-ref href=#longino1990>[longino1990] </a>. In other words, there is an important difference between an etymologically inspired belief that data are natural representations of the world — given rather than taken — and the idea that scientific observation generates objective information by providing epistemological order. The two positions are based on competing definitions of objectivity. Adopting the perspective that phenomena become data only when they are structured by an investigative agent invites an important debate about the objectivity of data once they are standardized and assembled, and that is a debate that I would be glad take part in.</p><p>I would not deny the merit of distinguishing between the idea of data-as-given and capta-as-taken. However, this distinction may be more a matter of emphasis than definition. Whatever the etymological roots and contemporary associations of data, we can take capta to emphasize that the measurements, readings, observations have been taken. As I have suggested, the wordcaptamay stir connotations of human bondage and violence. This association may be appropriate in some cases, especially in a moment when for-profit companies are covertly monetizing and selling data on the open market, often in direct conflict with the interests of its users. On the other hand, many data do not fit this description, and I think regarding all data as captive or hostage to their stewards is provocative, but ultimately misguided, especially where there is strong potential for unintended consequences.</p><p>As previously suggested, there are matters of utility to consider when deciding between data and capta as conceptual signposts. Many in digital humanists are likely using the termdataat least some of the time, either as a standalone key term, or in cognates or phrases like metadata, database, or data visualization. Going further down this path would allow digital humanists to compete more effectively for search engine keyword searches, which could make digital humanities scholarship more visible to audiences from the sciences. This would include direct searches, as well as related searches likedata analysis,data analytics,anddata usage,all of which are toprelated to datasearches on Google Trends. It would also encourage digital humanities to continue any previous efforts to engage directly with specialized topics such as data pedagogy, data literacy, open data, data management, and data curation.</p><p>Along these lines, thinking differently about the worddatamay lead to new exchanges of information among and between disciplines. Digital humanities, as a field, has a deeply interdisciplinary history, but a precondition to such interdisciplinarity is the premise that different disciplines can learn from one another. By engaging directly with concepts related to data, we have opportunity to shifts scholarly focus from the nature of data to strategies that promote engaging critically, theoretically, and computationally with data.</p><p>Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein take an approach of this sort in <em>Data Feminism</em> (2020). They define data as “information made tractable,” which I immediately associate with Marinus’ discussion ofordinatum. In various passages, D’Ignazio and Klein cite Donna Haraway, whose essay “Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective” (1988) called for “a doctrine of embodied objectivity that accommodates paradoxical and critical feminist science projects” <a class=footnote-ref href=#haraway1988>[haraway1988] </a>. Core to Haraway’s “feminist objectivity” is the principle of situated knowledges. Adapting and extending Haraway’s intervention, D’Ignazio and Klein argue that “one of the central tenets of feminist thinking is that all knowledge is situated” <a class=footnote-ref href=#dignazio2020>[dignazio2020] </a>. There is a more complicated discussion to be had about whether all knowledge is inherently situated or whether it is the work of feminism that situates it. Haraway seems to be arguing for the latter when she contrasts situated knowledges with “unlocatable, and so irresponsible, knowledge claims” <a class=footnote-ref href=#haraway1988>[haraway1988] </a>. Either way, all data have important contexts of creation and organization, and situating them (or emphasizing them as situated) includes critical examination of those contexts.<sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup></p><p>D’Ignazio and Klein describe numerous practices related to examining the context of data. These practices begin with understanding the conditions of production associated with data, including information about those who constructed the data. “When approaching any new source of knowledge,” they write, “it’s essential to ask questions about the social, cultural, historical, institutional, and material conditions under which that knowledge was produced, as well as about the identities of the people who created it” <a class=footnote-ref href=#dignazio2020>[dignazio2020] </a>. Like Gitelman, D’Ignazio and Klein argue against the existence of anything that might be called raw data<a class=footnote-ref href=#dignazio2020> [dignazio2020] </a>. They advocate for considering the “functional limitations of the data” and “any associated ethical obligations” <a class=footnote-ref href=#dignazio2020>[dignazio2020] </a>; “exploring and analyzing what is missing from a dataset” <a class=footnote-ref href=#dignazio2020>[dignazio2020] </a>; attending to “power differentials” that have shaped and/or continue to be present in collected data<a class=footnote-ref href=#dignazio2020> [dignazio2020] </a>; and interrogating a dataset’s validity — that is, the degree to which it can be said to represent the concept being analyzed<a class=footnote-ref href=#dignazio2020> [dignazio2020] </a>. They emphasize the importance of context at the stages of data acquisition, data analysis, and “framing and communication of results” <a class=footnote-ref href=#dignazio2020>[dignazio2020] </a>. Their advocacy is empowered rather than hindered by their adoption of a precise vocabulary that practitioners in a range of disciplines can recognize and quickly understand.<sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup></p><p>Similarly, Katherine Bode has argued in <em>A World of Fiction</em> (2019) for an intervention in computational literary studies based on the argument that “distant reading and macroanalysis construct and seek to extract meaning from models of literary systems that are essentially deficient,” which to say, “inadequate for representing the ways in which literary works existed and generated meaning in the past” <a class=footnote-ref href=#bode2019>[bode2019] </a>. Bode does not advocate that we reject data-driven literary history, as others have argued, nor does she endorse the adoption of “new, more elaborate forms of computational analysis” as a way around the conflict<a class=footnote-ref href=#bode2019> [bode2019] </a>.<sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup> Instead, she anchors her intervention around the idea of “a scholarly edition of a literary system” — which engages explicitly with modeling practices — as “a mechanism through which to interrogate and refine conceptions of literary works and systems” <a class=footnote-ref href=#bode2019>[bode2019] </a>. As with D’Ignazio and Klein, Bode calls for increased contextualization, for “a data-rich model of a literary system is inevitably an argument shaped by not only the scholar’s perception of cultural artifacts and phenomena but the complex history by which those artifacts and phenomena are transmitted to and by us in the present” <a class=footnote-ref href=#bode2019>[bode2019] </a>. Bode’s use of the key phrase “data-rich” is important to her argument, in that she presents it as an alternative to labels likedistant reading,macroanalysis,andcomputational literary history<a class=footnote-ref href=#bode2019> [bode2019] </a>. It is structurally reminiscent ofdata-drivenbut the adjectivalrichhas a strong contrast to the past participledriven, both in terms of connotation and its symbolic rejection of that idea that data ostensibly occupy the driver’s seat. D’Ignazio & Klein and Bode make very different interventions, but they share a common position that the termdatahas purchase, especially when that term is qualified with productively descriptive modifiers. Further, they base their work, in part, on the premise that data-driven inquiry can be executed more effectively if instilled with feminist and/or humanistic values.</p><p>If this premise is to be accepted, our conversations about how to improve upon computational inquiry can go further. Most immediately, there are implications for digital humanities pedagogy. As Ted Underwood has argued, “digital humanities classes, as currently defined, don’t really teach students how to use numbers&mldr;So it’s almost naive to discuss barriers to entry. There is no entrance to this field” <a class=footnote-ref href=#underwood2018>[underwood2018] </a>). Underwood argues that the cultural analytics subfield, in particular, operates primarily as a social network. In such a context competency and fluency come as a result of participants’ tacit knowledge and through person-to-person or small group interactions. In contrast, a well-defined curriculum with explicit pedagogies for teaching research design, data collection, data modeling, programming, and data analysis (including but not limited to quantitative analysis) would help create pathways to entry that are currently hidden for or unavailable to many people. Overt teaching of methods, Underwood argues, allows facility with methods to be more equally distributed. Discussing data literacy openly and critically strikes me as a key component of the curricular and pedagogical intervention Underwood has described.</p><p>There are wide-ranging benefits to speaking and writing about data, openly and often, with implications from the practical to the profound. As part of this strategy, we should ask our students to read about the history of the worddata, but to include how Euclid used the worddedoména, how Marinus described two different potential definitions for the word, and how natural philosophers of 17th-century England, in particular, appropriated dedoména’s Latin alternativedata. We should ask them to discuss why such thinkers saw similarities between the Greek notion of data and how they were collecting and structuring information they observed and recorded. We should speak openly about crucial concepts related to data-driven inquiry, including practices aimed at contextualizing and situating data and datasets. We should press the idea that social constructions foreground and pervade what many think of as neutral or natural measures of reality, and we should openly question paradigms of thought that emphasize data as self-evident or unproblematically objective. In short, with a sense of pride and purpose, let us say and write data, all the while remaining humanists.</p><ul><li id=oed2020a>“almanac, n.” _OED Online_ .
