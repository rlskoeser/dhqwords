Interdisciplinary in scope — including art history, public history, and the digital humanities — Salmi introduces major concepts, addresses well-known limitations, and broadly surveys the state of the field in the United States, Western Europe, and beyond. This is not a how-to manual for those building digital projects, but a what-is book, which deftly and concisely defines digital history as a branch of historical analysis.</p>
<p>Opening with an overview on digital culture and technology, Salmi grounds his study in its historical antecedents. The rapid development of technology in the decades following the Second World War provided new tools for scholars. The 1990s, in turn, saw the development of the World Wide Web and with it a rapid growth in digital scholarship — including the digitization of historical manuscripts and the development of online curatorial services. George Mason University’s Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM) was founded in 1994; its mission, as Stephen Robertson noted, was  “to democratize the past — to incorporate multiple voices, reach diverse audiences, and encourage popular participation in presenting and preserving the past”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Such pioneering projects paved the way for digital scholarship on a wider scale. Salmi, in particular, emphasizes the close association between digital history and public history within the United States. That was largely true for projects and digital centers developed in the 1990s, including the RRCHNM, but there are important methodological and philosophical differences between digital history and public history; recent digital history projects reflect this divergence. Salmi, however, minimizes the distinctions between these two subfields of the historical profession.</p>
<p>The opening chapter,  “The Digital Past,”  examines the distinction between  “born-digital”  and  “digitized”  data, and the limitations of both forms. From professional emails to personal Tweets, the digital age has brought with it a substantial amount of ephemera. If preserved, born-digital data offers underused but tantalizing subjects of future analysis for historians of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Housing an effusion of paper letters, reports, and manuscripts, archives and libraries across the globe have made concerted efforts to convert their vast, physical holdings into digital representations. Examples of digitized data include the Library of Congress’ American Memory Project, Google Books, and Spain’s El Archive General de Indias. Salmi, a nineteenth-century historian at the University of Turku in Finland, provides myriad examples of European digitization projects aimed at historians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Indeed, the merit of this work is its transnational scope. </p>
<p>Reading, Salmi argues, is not a straightforward process. In  “Reading and Textuality in Digital History,”  he considers reading in the digital age and the use of texts as big data. Close reading and textual interpretation  “have always been at the heart of history as a discipline”   <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Digital history, given the vast scope of the available data and the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), requires a different methodological approach: distant reading. Computer software and researchers mine ‘big data’ sets for micro and macro level patterns. Salmi, however, readily notes the limitations of OCR software and its many inaccuracies.</p>
<p>While not a major feature of the work, a cursory analysis of mapping and data visualization is included in  “Mapping and Viewing History.”  Influenced by the development and advancement of geospatial information systems, the spatial turn encouraged multidisciplinary collaborations: libraries digitized maps; scholars mapped historical data. Image digitization, too, has revolutionized the field, according to Salmi. Large-scale digitization of paintings, photographs, and other images have permitted distant viewing, a method of using computer software to interpret metadata. Focused mainly on art history and image digitization, Chapter 3 minimizes the importance of spatial analysis in digital history. Mapping is a powerful tool for historical research, and its importance is underestimated here.</p>
<p>A short fourth chapter,  “Interdisciplinarity: Challenges for Research,”  surveys some of the complexities of doing digital history. By its very nature, digital history is collaborative and reaches across traditional disciplinary boundaries. That is not new nor are such problems confined to digital history, notes Salmi. In practice, interdisciplinary exploration is difficult given the  “tension between disciplinary thinking and interdisciplinary pressure”   <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Salmi, however, still encourages collaboration while recognizing disciplinary boundaries and each fields’ unique idiosyncrasies. He concludes,  “Digital history . . . is not a discipline; it is a branch of historical practice that can also be an interdisciplinary enterprise in which the researcher must enter the trading zone”   <sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In this trading zone, historians may question their identity as scholars and must confront the innerworkings of their profession and articulate their research procedures to those outside their field.</p>
<p>In his final chapter,  “Presenting the Past in the Digital Age,”  Salmi returns to public history. Many digital projects — The Texas Slavery Project, for example — strive to present historical information to the public via the internet. Other projects pair visualizations with textual information to convey historical data and narration. Open-source programs enable historians to create graphs, timelines, and word clouds. This chapter, in particular, is helpful for those eager to learn more about open-source programs and digital tools, and Salmi lists but does not evaluate several specific programs — AntConc, Voyant Tools, D3, ManyEyes, Gephi, and TextArc, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Salmi is at times critical of digital history – addressing paywalls, OCR limitations, and interdisciplinary challenges – but he endorses this form of innovative methodology. Yet critics of digital history abound, and a more nuanced conversation regarding digital history’s limitations may have better served its practitioners, both current and future. Nonetheless, this slim volume fulfills an important purpose. Serving as a concise, clear introduction to the field,  <em>What is Digital History?</em>   is ideal for classroom instruction with advanced undergraduate or early-career graduate students. In particular, those teaching introductory historical methodology, public history, or digital history in the United States or Europe would be wise to incorporate this text into their classrooms. Raising key points and introducing innovative projects, this work would without a doubt inspire animated conversations and encourage others to enter the field.</p>

<p>To a great extent, what is known about architectural history stems from its practice, discussions in its various fields of study, and the accumulation of that information into knowledge. Such information has partly been expressed in an explicit form shared between different parties (from people to software agents). This mode of sharing calls for a mutual understanding of the content in the intended domain to unify the conception of different groups involved in the subject matter. The intended consensus also relies on interaction in a formal realm with a unified language. Therefore, in order to make such interaction possible in the field of architectural history, one needs to identify the domain and express the relevant knowledge in a clear and explicit manner. To do so, it seems viable to apply the tools designed specifically for the purpose.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence, a branch called ontology has developed, which provides the mentioned clarity in expressing the domain knowledge both by providing an inventory of key concepts and treating the relations between the concepts.</p>
<p>With the progress of science and technology, human beings’ ability to create new and advanced tools accelerated to the point of surpassing mundane affairs. Such tools were born to replicate human functions. Richard Sennett offers an interesting categorization of human-made tools, which he places into two groups: the replicant and the robot. A replicant is a tool that mirrors humans by mimicking their actions. However, a robot is an ameliorated human; it is more robust, works faster, and never tires. Still, we make sense of its functions by referring to our own human measures <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The mentioned functions may range from automatically completing an order, saving things in its memory, finding and retrieving certain items in bulk, or other tasks. Such robot-like tools are established on a somewhat simple basis: mirroring the human mind. Unlike the human mind, computers by character lack the willpower to learn and recall information, and it is up to us to accumulate the knowledge into its memory and decide how information is recounted (described) for machines.</p>
<p>In this paper, we aim to acknowledge the necessity of creating an intelligent robot-like system in the field of Iranian architectural history in the form of a semantic network; a system capable of functioning faster and more precise than humans and able to assist in completing certain tasks that are naturally too difficult, impossible, or subject to errors when done manually.</p>
<p>In order to provide these functions, it is necessary to familiarize the desired system with the field of inquiry by describing what it encompasses. Henceforth, the system would ground its additional functions based on clearly defined descriptions. In other words, human knowledge needs to be presented to the machine.</p>
<p>All forms of knowledge representation, including ontologies, are both mediums of expression for human beings and ways to communicate with machines in order to tell them about the world <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Therefore, engaging with sets of information related to the intended field, which needs to be categorized and described explicitly and logically, is a crucial act while developing an ontology.</p>
<p>Accordingly, this research mainly applies ontology to create a clear, explicit, and descriptive model of the semantic system in Iranian architectural history, taking into account various aspects of the field based on information provided by prominent scholars. In other words, here, the effort is focused on developing an ontology in the aforementioned field of knowledge, which is both explicit and readable for the machine, through capturing and representing the relevant entities in this field. What ensues this approach helps organize the views and provides consensus between different agents (people with each other or machines with people) on Iranian architectural history concepts.</p>
<h2 id="ontology-of-iranian-architectural-history-terminology">Ontology of Iranian architectural history: terminology</h2>
<p>This title of  “Ontology of Iranian architectural history”  consists of four terms: ontology,  Iranian architecture, and history, each of which offers multifaceted denotation causing the original term to indicate different meanings. To clarify what this title covers in the course of this paper, an overview of the specialized terminology is explained below.</p>
<p>Ontology: In the terminology of Artificial Intelligence, the term Ontology may refer to both the act of describing intended concepts explicitly and the specific outcome that is constructed and saved in the form of an XML or UML file, which contains data on concepts and their descriptions. That is so that we may have ontology files with different purposes and save them on our computers or share them with others. It should be noted that description in an ontology means providing formal definitions of terms in the domain vocabulary and representing each concept’s information in a relational form.</p>
<p>Concepts in an ontology must be structured in a way that is usually referred to as linked data; that is, data interlinked with other data to make information readable for machines and make queries within large bulks of information possible. Such links represent relationships within an area of study, and the model that contains all those concepts and relationships is what we call an ontology. Although at the heart of each ontology there is hierarchical taxonomy, yet since an ontology allows more complex and non-hierarchal relationships to be defined, it can be used to represent the fluidity of the real world, where things can be related to each other in more complex ways than are represented by a hierarchical tree-like structure. In that sense, an ontology is more like a spider’s web <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Iranian architecture: Iran in this paper refers to the Iranian world, which transcends modern Iran’s current political boundaries. Simultaneously, Iranian architecture covers all architectural works associated with Iran’s territory throughout its history.</p>
<p>History: Michael Stanford distinguishes two meanings of the term history. History  “may refer either to the course of events, what actually happened. (history 1), or what is believed and written about those events (history 2). Sometimes they are distinguished as  history-as-event  and  history-as-account. ”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="iranian-architectural-history">Iranian architectural history</h2>
<p>Based on Stanford’s distinction, Iranian architectural history can imply two meanings, where architectural history may be considered as series of events, actually occurred in the world (Iranian architectural history 1), and architectural history as the act of studying and describing what has occurred in the world (Iranian architectural history 2). Given that in developing ontologies, we are appointed to capture how human beings characterize their concepts, rather than actual events and whether or not they happened in a specific way, we need to be associated with Iranian architectural history 2, as the scholarship of architectural history is classified under it, and involves the study of architectural history-as-event <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the intended domain comprises a broad spectrum of studies on architectural evidence and different sorts of human architectural activities. In other words, we regard Iranian architectural history as a series of reports that narrate certain historical events related to works of architecture, architects, the act of building.</p>
<h2 id="process-of-creating-the-iarchhist-ontology1">process of creating The IArchHist ontology<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></h2>
<p>Architecture and architectural history are among cultural matters related to human affairs that enfold all the changeability and historicity that such matters enjoy in any given culture, including the Iranian culture. Additionally, unlike western tradition, the historiography of Iranian architecture is not a longstanding practice. Contemporary attempts to write Iranian architectural history have been performed mainly by two groups of individuals: first, European travelers, archeologists, and architects that came to Iran during the 20th century and composed reports of their observations; second, Iranian specialists, such as archeologists, architects, and authors, who were mostly employed in institutions like Society for National Heritage (SNH) and were responsible for documenting historical buildings for the purpose of conservation. Both groups lacked academic training in historiography. In other words, the existing historiography of Iranian architecture has been developed by non-historians in its academic sense. Therefore, Iranian architectural history has yet to become an established academic discipline with formalized terminological and theoretical peripheries. The inconsistent quality of historiography in the sphere of Iranian architectural history has given rise to its close association with architectural works, their chronology, and the vocabulary and methods that were used to examine them throughout history.</p>
<p>Developing ontologies is drawn on logical relationships, so in branches of the humanities, such as history, art, and architectural history, which are less concerned with positive knowledge, creating an ontology that requires data derived from reasons and logical observation poses some challenges. On top of that, even in the western scholarly world, architectural history is still highly dominated by the disciplines of art history and history of architecture and is advancing towards a distinct discipline. Accordingly, Iranian architectural history, in its current state, lacks a formalized terminology and is still undergoing its formation process.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Based on the facts explained about the field of Iranian architectural history, describing the terms through their relationships is also challenging since the terms have not been used uniformly in the context of writings from different scholars or even a single source. In other words, the field’s scholars lack a unified language when referring to concepts.</p>
<p>Since Iranian architectural history has yet to evolve as an academic field, its existing sources involve subjective reports of buildings that are influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions of the narrator. This poses a challenge in machinizing Iranian architectural history knowledge, which requires objective and straightforward data.</p>
<p>However, the very challenges provoked by the field’s nature simultaneously make it essential to undertake available tools (like ontologies) to organize its knowledge. In fields such as Iranian architectural history, developing an ontology contributes to identifying the field’s ambiguities and immaturities in a precise manner. Therefore, here, the ontology provides advantages related to overseeing the field in the course of its formation.</p>
<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>
<p>Usually, the first step for developing an ontology is to consider using the existing models, or the least, an existing taxonomy. Over the past few decades, several representational models have become available in the field of art, architecture, and cultural heritage. These models include database schemata for integrating heritage information, such as CIDOC CRM (CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model) metadata for description of museum objects, such as Object ID, controlled vocabularies of related fields like Getty art &amp; architecture thesaurus (AAT).</p>
<p>Assuming that we were to use concepts represented in AAT, for instance, each concept must be an exact equivalent in Persian and English, in terms of definition, implication, and relations to other concepts; otherwise, the goal to represent the reality of Iranian architectural history identities would not be fulfilled. This level of correspondence simply does not exist. That is because the Persian-speaking societies of art and architecture naturally do not match up with the anglosphere one. Many of the identities discussed here are either only found in Persian-speaking cultures, or even if found elsewhere, do not encompass the exact same thing, mainly due to cultural differences that are often neglected in universal attempts to develop comprehensive formal ontologies. Therefore, in most cases, when observed carefully, concepts (that are embedded in words), albeit close in meaning, are not identical in the Persian and anglosphere worlds. Based on these considerations, the IArchHist ontology was developed as a unilingual ontology in Persian.</p>
<p>The most basic premise held in developing the IArchHist ontology is that it is possible to represent the knowledge of architectural history through its identified concepts. Such concepts must be thoroughly defined in the course of developing the ontology and be clarified to reach the processing level of the machines.</p>
<p>Here an issue arises: how to make relatively ambiguous concepts understandable for machines. At this point, the second premise emerges, stating that concepts are understood and defined through their association with other concepts. The human mind identifies each concept’s meaning by placing it in an elaborate network of its related concepts and recognizing how they are linked. The ontology replicates the same process by representing existing relational links between concepts. As a result, each concept is conceptualized within a specific structure, which is processable for machines.</p>
<h2 id="the-scope-of-the-inventory">The scope of the inventory</h2>
<p>As a discipline, Iranian architectural history involves certain concepts, which are indefinite by nature, are not directly expressed, and therefore, cannot be adequately described. For instance, there is the concept of principle in Iranian historical buildings’ architectural design. Pirnia, a distinguished Iranian architectural historian, proposes five principles of Iranian architecture as follows: human scale, introversion, self-sufficiency, precluding futility, structural soundness, and proportion <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Although he further describes these concepts in the course of his studies, because of their propensity to diverse interpretations, it is hard or even impossible to catch a clear and explicit, and more importantly, a consensual definition; hence, the possibility of failure in representing these concepts through IArchHist ontology. Therefore, it is essential to delimit the semantic boundary for the selection of concepts in the relevant field.</p>
<p>The fundamental criterion is that each IArchHist ontology entity requires a formal description that is logical and certified, which would explain the concept it represents. Therefore, all those concepts that are describable in logical phrases clearly and explicitly are covered in the IArchHist ontology, while evaluative or rhetoric concepts are avoided.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  Consequently, the project scope covers Iranian architectural historians’ works who referred to both the material evidence (the relics) and the textual evidence of Iranian architecture.</p>
<p>The information used to build the IArchHist ontology was collected from contemporary (written or published during the 80s and 90s in Iran) domain-specific works.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  The appointed references consist of Iranian scholars’ works from four main fields of architectural history, historical geography, archeology, and restoration, and include classes of objects, events, processes, states of affairs, attributes of objects, parts of objects, segments of processes. The selected scholars and their compositions are considered references and major sources within Iranian architectural history.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p><a href="#noy2001">Noy &amp; McGuinness (2001)</a> proposed an outline for developing ontologies, which involves the following seven steps: 1) Determine the domain and scope of the ontology; 2) Consider reusing existing ontologies; 3) Enumerate essential terms in the ontology; 4) Define the classes and the class hierarchy; 5) Define the properties of classes — slots; 6) Define the facets of the slots; 7) Create instances. In developing the IArchHist, the methodology proposed by Noy &amp; McGuinness is applied by simultaneously performing the suggested steps and including additional measures when necessary. Following this strategy, the methodology in building the IArchHist ontology is mapped out into the following five stages:</p>
<p>Steps 1 &amp; 2: Determining the purpose and the scope; selecting the key references;<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  choosing the appropriate ontology language and software.  Steps 3 &amp; 4: A taxonomy is an orderly classification for a defined domain. It comprises controlled vocabulary terms (generally only preferred terms) organized into a hierarchical structure. Each term in a taxonomy is in one or more parent/child (broader/ narrower) relationships to other terms in the taxonomy <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. In order to create the taxonomy for IArchHist ontology, two steps were necessary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Forming the inventory: cataloging key concepts from information provided by references;  2. Categorization: grouping related concepts together, organizing them in a hierarchical order, and defining upper-level classes.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are explained in detail in section 4.  Steps 5 &amp; 6: In order to describe the internal structure of the domain concepts outlined in the previous step, we must identify and draw semantic relations between concepts, which have been suggested and specified by domain scholars. Each link must connect at least two concepts producing precise, unambiguous text definition for every pair of concepts that can be expressed in short logical phrases.  Step 7: The defined concepts in the previous steps mainly cover general entities indicating each concept’s types and genre. In order to make the IArchHist ontology richer and more detailed, we must assign instances to each general concept. Such instances inherit the relations previously outlined between their prime concepts.  Visualization: As soon as the ontology is built, the challenge of how to use it, how to explore it, and what data to recall arises. Visualization is mainly based on mapping the information to a graphical representation to facilitate data interpretation. It also provides ways to limit the amount of data users receive while keeping them  “aware”  of the full information <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. The type of visualization depends on the user’s intention; however, concerning IArchHist ontology, direct 2D graphs was deemed the most acceptable since it is more familiar and direct for users.</p>
<h2 id="iarchhist-ontology">IArchHist ontology</h2>
<h2 id="the-taxonomy-of-iarchhist-ontology">The Taxonomy of IArchHist Ontology</h2>
<p>By implementing the conventional methods of building ontologies in the domain of Iranian architectural history, a representative model of the domain was created, which will be thoroughly described in the next section.</p>
<p>The IArchHist ontology is an OWL 2 ontology created in Protégé 5 editor, represents Iranian architectural concepts by taking into account different aspects of the subject material. This ontology was developed in Persian. Capturing the main concepts of the IArchHist ontology required building a large lexicon of terms. Here, each term was significant because it referred to a concept of the domain. Concepts, also called Class or Type, or Universal, are fundamental building blocks of the IArchHist ontology, as any other. Each class represents a set of instances (also known as individuals) that share one or more common properties. These properties are identified according to the information provided by key references. Whether physical or nonphysical, spatial or temporal, each item within the domain has been thoroughly represented in the ontology.</p>
<p>For example, the class of masjid-i jāmiʿ (Friday mosque)<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  includes all the individuals that have the following properties:<br>
Is a type of masjid (mosque)  Is a place for duʿā (prayer)  Is a place for namāz-i Jumʿa (Friday prayer)  Has a part minbar (pulpit)</p>
<p>Therefore, individuals such as masjid-i jāmiʿ-i Isfahān (Friday mosque of Isfahān, masjid-i jāmiʿ-i Yazd (Friday mosque of Yazd), masjid-i jāmiʿ-i ‎ Ardistān (Friday mosque of Ardistān) all belong to this class, and all share the mentioned properties.</p>
<p>To accurately record classes and their related properties, each phrase of the mentioned texts containing related information was documented in a separate datasheet. These phrases were labeled under entries named by the exact terms utilized in the text in the original language.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  The terms were further employed as IArchHist ontology classes and subclasses. An example is shown below (Table 1).<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><br>
Example of information about sardar (portal)    Text  Citation      A darāygāh (entrance) contains faḍā (space)s such as pīsh-utāq (anteroom), sardar (portal), dargāh (doorway), hashtī (vestibule), keryās (lobby), dehlīz (entrance hall), dālān (corridor).  <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>      Physical parts of the masjid (mosque), shaped around a ḥayāṭ (courtyard) and a dargāh (doorway), with a sardar (portal), and a pīshṭāq (arched portal) are adequately linked together, creating the architecture of the masjid (mosque).  <sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>      Each bāgh (garden) comprised a darāygāh (entrance); a building sometimes called sardar (portal). This building was similar to bīrunī (the public or male quarters of wealthy households) part of traditional khāna (house)s, which was the place for padhīrāyī (receiving guests).  <sup id="fnref3:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>      In sangī (stone) kārvānsarā (caravanserai), sardar (portal)s were made from ājur (brick).  <sup id="fnref4:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>      masjid-i jāmiʿ-i ʿAbbāsī (Abbasi Friday mosque) has a sardar (portal) decorated with kāshī-yi tarāsh (mosaic tile)  <sup id="fnref5:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>   <br>
In Table 1, related information to the term sardar (portal) is shown. A sardar (portal) is the main façade of some buildings in Iranian historical architecture containing various elements used as a complex entrance system. Each cited phrase contains related concepts to Sardar, which can be listed as follows (Table 2):<br>
Concepts related to sardar (portal)    darāygāh (entrance)  ḥayāṭ (courtyard)      faḍā (space)  pīshṭāq (arched portal)      pīsh-utāq (anteroom)  bāgh (garden)      sardar (portal)  bīrūnī (the public or male quarters of wealthy households)      dargāh (doorway)  khāna (house)      hashtī (vestibule)  sang (stone)      keryās (lobby)  kārvānsarā (caravanserai)      dehlīz (entrance hall)  ājur (brick)      dālān (corridor)  masjid-i jāmiʿ-i ʿAbbāsī (Abbasi friday mosque)      masjid (mosque)  kāshī-yi tarāsh (mosaic tile)   <br>

<h2 id="interconnections-of-iarchhist-ontology">Interconnections of IArchHist ontology</h2>
<p>The main challenge of developing the IArchHist ontology was describing the concepts via their interconnected relations. This process passes beyond a taxonomic description, which only lays out the type of each entity by a hierarchical relation to its upper (broader) class. The ontological model was further enriched by the description of the internal structure of concepts, which was accomplished by determining each concept&rsquo;s properties.</p>
<p>According to OWL, properties may appear as data properties or object properties. Data properties include all descriptive and behavioral aspects that relate to the entities under consideration – such as their geometrical, physical, and behavioral features – which are defined by specific values associated with those attributes. Instead, the object properties represent the connections that exist between each entity and the others, within and between the involved knowledge domains <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Since the key references provide information in natural language, to identify the properties of each concept, we need to rewrite the information in logical phrases so that the building units (concepts and relations) of each phrase can be inferred and transferred into protégé. For example, in the case of sardar (portal), the following statements are inferred:</p>
<ul>
<li>sardar (portal) is one of the architectural elements of a darāygāh (entrance).</li>
<li>Some masjid (mosque)s have a sardar (portal)</li>
<li>Some bāgh (garden)s have a sardar (portal)</li>
<li>Some khāna (house)s have a sardar (portal)</li>
<li>Some sardar (portal)s are made of ājur (brick)</li>
<li>Some sardar (portal)s are decorated with kāshī-yi tarāsh(mosaic tile)</li>
</ul>
<p>Relations in an ontology can be categorized into two groups: first, the general relations (like hierarchy or whole-part), which are not specific to a particular domain and can be found in any domain of knowledge. Second, are specific relations, which are appointed to a particular domain. For example, Having Material or Being Decorated By are two properties probably only directed to the concepts found in the domain of Iranian architecture history.</p>
<p>The above list includes some properties that relate a certain concept to sardar (portal) and specify how it is related to sardar (portal). That is how an entity called sardar (portal) participates in connections to other concepts. One instance is explained below:</p>
<p>It has been said that in the masjid-i jāmiʿ-i ʿAbbāsī (Abbasi Friday mosque), the sardar (portal) has been decorated with a type of tile (kāshī) called kāshī-yi tarāsh (mosaic tile). According to this statement, a sardar (portal) (like the one in Abbasi Friday mosque) can be decorated with kāshī-yi tarāsh. Therefore, to make the intended connection, units of the statement can be separated:<br>
Concept 1: sardar (portal)  Concept 2: kāshī-yi tarāsh (mosaic tile)  Link (OWL object property): IsDecoratedWith</p>
<p>The representative model is shown in Figure 2.</p>

</figure>
<p>Here, the property IsDecoratedWith describes a binary relationship between two individuals of sardar and kāshī-yi tarāsh. Now consider all of the individuals that have an IsDecoratedWith relationship to some other individual. We can think of these individuals as belonging to the class of individuals with some IsDecoratedWith relationship. What is noteworthy here is the fact that relationships are also capable of defining a class of individuals. In OWL, we can define such classes by using restrictions <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Using restrictions signifies how each supposed relationship applies to the instances of each concept. For example:<br>
Do all instances of sardar (portal) have this property? (Is this property universal?)  Do specific instances of sardar (portal) have this property? (Is this an existential property?)</p>
<p>OWL restrictions fall into three main categories:<br>
Quantifier Restrictions  Cardinality Restrictions  hasValue Restrictions</p>
<p>In IArchHist ontology, the quantifier restriction is the dominant mode of control and can be further categorized into existential and universal restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An existential restriction describes a class of individuals with at least one (some) relationship along with a specified property to an individual that is a member of a specified class.</li>
<li>Universal restrictions describe the set of individuals that, for a given property, only have relationships with other individuals that are members of a specific class <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the above example, the property IsDecoratedWith was assigned to the class sardar (portal) along with an existential restriction, which describes the class of individuals that have at least one IsDecoratedWith relationship to an individual that is a member of the class kāshī-yi tarāsh, which means there exists at least one instance of the class sardar (portal) that is decorated with kāshī-yi tarāsh.</p>
<h2 id="classes-and-sub-classes-in-iarchhist-ontology">Classes and Sub-classes in IArchHist ontology</h2>
<p>By following the mentioned strategies, the first draft of IArchHist ontology was developed covering 1924 concepts, interconnected by 103 object properties. The critical component of the ontological model, being the concepts and their semantic relations, provided an overview of the knowledge in the field of Iranian architectural history and an understanding of the branches of concepts in this domain.</p>
<p>According to IArchHist ontology, two upper-classes were defined to capture the concepts of the field: IArchHist concept and IArchHist related concept where the former encompasses the central concept of Iranian architectural history and the latter those such as rituals, beliefs, periods, which act as intermediary concepts of the field.</p>
<p>The class IArchHist concept contains the following subclasses (Figure 3):<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><br>

<p>Agent: This class includes the agents that participate in the development of an architectural relic. Agents are divided into two categories: human agents and non-human agents (Figure 6).</p>
<p>Human agents can be further categorized regarding the state of their interaction with the relics. Some agents have a role in erecting buildings (including the architect, the contractor, the tile worker, the carpenter, etc.). Some help in the maintenance of the relics (guards, lightkeepers, etc.). Some are the user of relics (travelers, pilgrims, etc.), and some have instigated the formation of a relic through the needs or beliefs of the social group they belong to (like Christians, Europeans). Additionally, some agents have affected the formation or continuity of relics, despite their non-human origin (like gods or goddesses).</p>

<h2 id="resolving-challenges-in-iarchhist-ontology">Resolving challenges in IArchHist ontology</h2>
<p>As we mentioned briefly in <a href="#section4-2">sub-section 4.2</a>, The main challenge in the development process of IArchHist ontology was representing relations based on the data derived from sources. It is important to note that in languages such as OWL, we are mainly able to draw binary relations (meaning we can use properties that link only two individuals). However, in reality, the domain of Iranian architectural history contains certain concepts that require in their representation, a type of relationship that links an entity to more than just one other entity or value. These relations are called n-ary relations <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. N-ary relations are more complex types of links, and drawing them is usually quite tricky and often requires specific tactics.</p>
<p>Consider the following examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ceiling of Friday mosque of Fahraj is quite detailed but human-scaled.<br>
In this case, one might view the relationship as a binary relation between the individual Friday mosque of Fahraj and its ceiling and represent it as shown in Figure 8. However, here we see additional aspects of that relationship, including its ornamental attribute (being detailed) and the spatial quality it creates (being human-scaled) associated with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In most ontologies, especially in humanities, such instances of a relation cannot be viewed as an instance of a binary relation with additional attributes attached to it. Instead, it is an illustration of the individual Friday mosque of Fahraj and the complex object representing various facts about its constituents.</p>
<p>Following the general guidelines posed by <a href="#noy2006">Noy &amp; Rector (2006)</a>, in the IArchHist ontology, we represented such problematic relationships by adding an intermediate class involving all sub-relations associated with the broader relationship (Figure 9).</p>

<h2 id="iarchhist-outcomes">Iarchhist outcomes</h2>
<p>As we have shown in the course of this paper, the nature of some fields, such as architectural history, imposes somewhat theoretical regard to ontologies as knowledge representation tools rather than their typical goals involving the establishment of a shared understanding. The challenges faced when developing IArchHist, which for the most part was related to ambiguity and indefiniteness of concepts, gave rise to a strategy for outlining a methodology for developing the intended ontology, a methodology which, unlike other domains, is more simultaneous rather than a step-by-step procedure.</p>
<p>The development of the IArchHist ontology prompted three outcomes that would significantly benefit scholars and researchers of Iranian architecture history. The first outcome is the data collected while developing the ontology. The lack of structured databases or other forms of organized data collections in the focused field was a problematic research challenge. All of the field&rsquo;s main sources are paper-based books and articles. The process of developing IArchHist ontology, as explained earlier, simultaneously led to collecting data in a structured manner, which included describing and representing various and, in some cases, several relationships between each pair of data.</p>
<p>The second outcome is producing relatively precise descriptions and definitions for each concept in the scope of IArchHist ontology. Since drawing the relationships between concepts required uncovering each concept&rsquo;s nature and what it logically encompasses, a descriptive set of literal definitions was created during IArchHist ontology development. For example, when attempting to represent the concept of &ldquo;mosque&rdquo; and drawing its relations to the concept of &ldquo;dome,&rdquo; a series of logical questions were raised: what is the nature of the relationship between mosques and domes? Must all mosques encompass a dome? Should a building necessarily include a dome in order to be called a mosque? If any building possesses a dome, can we then call it a mosque? Attempting to answer these questions and others along the same line resulted in uncovering the relations between the concepts, such as mosque and dome, and ultimately made it possible to acquire a comprehensive and exclusive definition for each concept.</p>
<p>The third outcome is that by objectively relating our concepts, we are able to identify new patterns and pose new questions or find new explanations for formerly resolved issues. For instance, the concept of architect is among the sub-classes of agent in IArchHist ontology. Typically, vernacular architects are considered to be responsible for building design. However, in IArchHist ontology, the class architect is related to sub-classes of relic and characteristic through the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architect designs building</li>
<li>Architect erects vault</li>
<li>Architect renovates building complex</li>
<li>Architect calculates building geometry</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties show that there are cases of Iranian architects that were responsible for more than just building designs. They were individuals with knowledge of building construction, and in some cases, they were asked to propose renovation outlines for building complexes. Instances of all the mentioned roles are included in the IArchHist ontology.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper presents an overview of developing an ontology in the field of Iranian architectural history named IArchHist ontology. The main challenge here was responding to the question of &ldquo;how knowledge representation with ontologies helps organize data in a field consisting of a plethora of ambiguous and unstructured information scattered in resources. As explained in the course of this paper, an exclusive strategy was established, which was based on the development methodologies of conventional ontologies. The results of this research promote two key ideas:<br>
Methodological approach: In addition to resolving the fundamental issues of the particular field, the process of IArchHist development provokes a new practice of understanding and studying knowledge, which takes place while describing ambiguous concepts and uncovering their logical relations. Accomplishing such purposes demands revealing the complex semantic network that draws the explicit or implicit connections between concepts.  Developed product: The outcome of this research is basically a bounded part of Iranian architectural history ontology, which can be visualized and analyzed thoroughly with different techniques and further refined under field experts. That act of operating the different tasks, from describing to classifying and linking data sets at the same time, makes the process of developing IArchHist ontology much more valuable than the physical outcome. In order to reach an agreeable description for each concept, a constant reciprocating strategy was needed to improve the representative model of domain concepts continuously.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this research opens up new possibilities for further investigation into the use of ontology as a tool for organizing concepts in the field of Iranian architectural history by displaying their ambiguities and disorders. Furthermore, the suggested classification system could contribute to thinking more clearly within the focused field of knowledge through clear and unambiguous terms and concepts.</p>

<p>This article proposes an approach to designing project-based, credit–bearing digital humanities internships. The ideas expressed result from experiments in engaging students with digital projects affiliated with the Digital Humanities Institute at the University of North Florida.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  I review scholarship on experiential learning and DH pedagogy, and examine reasons why digital humanities internships are valuable for students, faculty, and institutions. I then outline three general types of DH internships, providing examples for each and suggesing some possible learning outcomes and structures for organizing student work. I also reflect on some of the institutional factors that can contribute to making these experiences possible.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<h2 id="experiential-learning-and-internships-across-the-academy">Experiential Learning and Internships Across the Academy</h2>
<p>The concept of experiential learning, as discussed in the academic realm today, derives from the work of John Dewey in the early twentieth century. In  <em>Democracy and Education</em> , Dewey defined the dual nature of experience as both action and our reflection upon that action, and pondered the implications of this model for how we learn <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. In  <em>Experience and Education</em> , Dewey further articulated a vision for a new type of education constructed around lived experience and a process of synthesis through which we can discover connections and convert such activity into meaning <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Dewey’s ideas influenced trends at the margins of education in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and in the second, informed what would become a major theme in pedagogical theory and practice. The proliferation of scholarship in this period is too great to fully summarize here, but a few key moments stand out. The Cooperative Education Association was founded in 1963, and began publishing the  <em>Journal of Cooperative Education</em>  the following year <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The National Society for Experiential Education was founded in 1971 and began an annual conference which celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 2021 <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. In 1976, M. Keeton edited a volume of essays organized around a model called Cooperative Assessment of Experiential Learning (CAEL), designed to address shortcomings in educational practice <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The following year, the Association for Experiential Education was incorporated, and in 1978 began publishing the  <em>Journal of Experiential Education</em>   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Building on prior work <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, D.A. Kolb articulated in 1984 an influential four-stage model for experiential learning, in conjunction with a related taxonomy of learning types <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. In 1995, R.J. Kraft and J. Kielsmeier published a manual comprised of essays from the  <em>Journal of Experiential Education</em>   <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and J.A. Cantor surveyed experiential practices in higher education <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An emphasis on experiential and project–based learning continues to represent a central tendency. In recent years, Seaman et al. have traced the history of experiential learning theory <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> and Heilbronn et al. have examined the continuing relevance of Dewey&rsquo;s ideas in the twenty-first century <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. D. Hutchison has considered the place of experiential activities in online learning <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, and J.H. Fede, K.S. Gorman, and M.E. Cimini have studied the role of student on–campus employment in the development of transferrable skills <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. J.Isaak et al. have looked at institutional attempts to expand student access to experiential learning opportunities <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. L.C. Wang and L.R. Fuller have analyzed the relationship between student motivation and pedagogical outcomes in service learning courses <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Coyer et al. have studied the potential for experiential learning conducted locally to contribute to global learning outcomes <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Researchers have also reflected on numerous case studies in different fields. These include Kärnä-Behm in art and design <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>; A. Nelson in arts management <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>; E. Nir and J. Musial in criminal justice <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>; R. Douglas–Lenders, P.J. Holland, and B. Allen in construction <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>; R.J. Durkin in engineering <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>; and V. Villarroel et al. in psychology <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Among the numerous studies in business are those of D.S. Maguire <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>, L. Valenzuela et al. <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>, D. Finch et al. <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>, and A.L. Leal-Rodríguez and G. Albort-Morant <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In recent decades, scholars have focused on internships in particular. This tendency was signaled by the CEA when it expanded its name in the late 1990s, becoming the Cooperative Education  <em>and Internship</em>  Association <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Attention has been paid to matters including the development of partnerships with external entities, internships as a strategy for industry engagement, the assessment of outcomes, and interns&rsquo; perceptions of their own learning. Scholars including Binder et al. <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>; M.T. Hora, E. Parrott, and P. Her <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>; C. Burns and S. Chopra <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>; and H.F. Sweitzer and M.A. King <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> examine such questions broadly across disciplines.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p>
<p>As in the case of experiential learning more generally, researchers have considered internships within specific academic areas or professional fields. Such studies include those of S. Stevenson and J. Hannaford in academic librarianship <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>; A.C. Cuyler and A.R. Hodges in arts management <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>; W. Haque in computing <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>; S.M. Zehr and R. Korte in engineering <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>; K. Weinstein in graphic design <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>; J.L. Morrissey et al. in kinesiology <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>; M.H. Sauder and M. Mudrick in sport management <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>; and S.M. Matthew, R.M. Taylor, and R.A. Ellis in veterinary education <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="experiential-learning-and-internships-in-the-humanities">Experiential Learning and Internships in the Humanities</h2>
<p>Compared to the abundance of scholarship in some fields, that which addresses experiential learning the humanities is relatively scarce. This is, perhaps, a reflection of the fact that, as G.R. Ratsoy observes, students in the humanities tend to have less access to such opportunities <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. It may also be a product of the looser connections — or what are perceived as such — between the humanities and applied work. In many professional fields, designing hands-on experiences for students is perhaps a more straightforward task than doing the same for students whose programs of study do not lead directly to specific areas of practice.</p>
<p>Some studies focus on experiences that engage the communication and problem-solving skills of humanities students, outside the context of their particular fields of study. Ratsoy, for instance, has considered possibilities for humanities students to serve as active participants in experiments related to the scholarship of teaching and learning <sup id="fnref1:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. S.R. Koendjbiharie has examined the role that humanities students can play in large-scale course-based consultancy projects for corporations <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Other scholarship considers opportunities that relate more specifically to the materials and methods of humanities fields. K. Lucas and P. Radia look at student involvement in extracurricular projects connected to literary studies <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. J. Oxley and R. Ilea have edited a collection examining experiential strategies for teaching within philosophy <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. K. de Bruin, L.O. Erickson, and J. Hammadou Sullivan have considered ways that experiential learning can be used to address the pressures that French programs face in today&rsquo;s academic climate, proposing the construction of  “cross-disciplinary programs with French experiential learning opportunities”  that can address  “the demands of students, parents, and administrators,”  while also staying true to a central mission of those programs by  “expanding the reach of French literary, cinematographic, artistic, philosophical, and historical education to even more students”   <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Studies looking specifically at internships within humanities fields are also relatively sparse. Scholars have considered the role of internships in graduate-level humanities education <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>, particularly in a twenty-first century context. For E.J. Balleisen and M.L. Wisdom, internships are one component of an approach to the formation of  “versatile humanists,”  whom they describe as being  “open to interdisciplinary approaches and collaborative projects, curious about new methodologies and analytical tools, and thoughtful about questions of scholarly impact, outreach, and engagement.”  They point to key benefits for students as being  “professional networking, resume building, and having a  story  to tell future employers”   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Those considerations take place in the context of preparing humanities PhD students for employment in careers beyond academia following the decline of the job market in humanities fields since 2007 <sup id="fnref1:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. At the undergraduate level, where the great majority of students are bound for professions outside of the respective academic fields in which they have earned degrees, the need for such preparation would seem even more urgent. Scholarly work on the topic, however, is scant. One of the of the most extensive studies is a report produced in 1984 by the Washington Center, with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities and other agencies <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. Also in 1984, the Washington Center published a  <em>Directory of Undergraduate Internships in the Humanities</em>   <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>, a resource that does not appear to have been updated or repeated.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, perhaps, the most examined intersections between the humanities and the world of work today seem to not deal with experiential learning for humanities students, but rather the benefits of humanities education for students in professional fields, or the incorporation of humanities methods into those fields. Such ideas are prominent, for instance, within business <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> and psychiatry <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. The advantages of integrating the humanities into medical education has been recognized since at least the 1980s <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>, and medical humanities represents an important current within the formation of health professionals today <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. Parallel tendencies exist in other fields, including  “sports humanities”   <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. This embrace of the humanities, along with the social sciences, can be seen also within interdisciplinary spaces — like  “environmental humanities”   <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup> — that are less closely tied to specific professional fields.</p>
<h2 id="why-dh-internships">Why DH Internships?</h2>
<p>The digital humanities have evolved into a space that can provide opportunities for hands-on learning, and in response, scholars in recent years have examined the pedagogical potential of the field. In 2012, Brett Hirsch edited the volume  <em>Digital Humanities Pedagogy</em>   <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>; in 2014,  <em>CEA Critic</em>  devoted a special issue to digital humanities in the English classroom <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>; and in 2017,  <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em>  published a special issue on digital humanities in the undergraduate curriculum more broadly <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>. More recently, scholars have studied the use of digital humanities to teach within the fields of nineteenth-century literature <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup> and philosophy <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Researchers have also examined the relationship between DH pedagogy and publicly funded DH research projects <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>; the role of library instruction in the teaching of DH skills <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>; and the intersections between gender <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>, race, and ethnicity <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup> in the context of digital humanities pedagogy.</p>
<p>Within the scholarship on DH pedagogy, a modest amount of work addresses matters related to digital humanities internships in particular. Most commonly, such studies are articulated from a library perspective, a circumstance that is perhaps not surprising given the support within many libraries for DH, as well as the structures libraries often have for employing students. R. Risam, J. Snow, and S. Edwards consider the role of internships in building a digital humanities community based on collaboration between students, academic faculty and the library <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>. S. Morris describes a library–led, six–week summer internship program at Lafayette College, in which students direct digital humanities projects <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>. K. Denda and J. Hunter likewise consider the possible outcomes of student engagement on digital projects within the library <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>. P. Hswe and her collaborators consider two digital humanities internships at The Pennsylvania State University <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the relatively sparse scholarship on DH internships, these experiences offer valuable opportunities for participants. Students in the humanities gain the chance to think differently about their fields and acquire skills that can open paths toward a broad range of professions. Students in computing and related areas have the chance to examine intersections between technology and culture, a process that likewise can influence how they view their studies and future directions. More generally, DH internships can help all students develop their capacities for critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving, as well as time and project management and outreach skills. These experiences can help students to build confidence, gain a sense of achievement, and develop awareness of their own potential.</p>
<p>English major Sarah Dumitrascu summarized many of these benefits in a reflective essay at the end of her internship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before taking DIG4944 this semester, I had never worked on such a large scale, self-directed project. I think it is easy to take for granted just how pre-planned and structured the majority of undergraduate college classes are — you show up on day one with syllabus in hand, and from then on out, it is your professor dictating your assignments, responsibilities, and deadlines. While some elements of this internship were decided for me (like this reflective essay, for example), the majority of the class’s structure was left up to me. And while I met with my advisor once every two weeks, there were no classes to attend, nor was there anyone to check in on me every time I worked on my transcription. This class has, by far, allotted me the most independence I have ever had in my college career; at times, that felt liberating, and at other times, it made things more difficult. But by venturing into this unknown territory, I have learned responsibility and self-discipline, time and project management, and problem-solving techniques. While my work in this course could certainly lead me into specific academic and professional disciplines, I think that, in a more holistic sense, it has prepared me to be self-directive and successful in a variety of different roles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While such a process of discovery can have implications for students&rsquo; long-term academic and professional trajectories, these internships also have more immediate and concrete benefits. Students can highlight their experiences on their resumes and discuss them when applying to jobs, graduate programs, or other opportunities. These internships can also create openings for students to participate in academic and professional events on campus and beyond. Students mentioned in this article, for instance, have recently presented at regional, national, and international conferences including HASTAC <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>, Latin American Studies Association <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>, National Council on Public History <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>, National Humanities Conference <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>, Society for Textual Scholarship <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>, the Society of Southwest Archivists <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>, and a webinar series sponsored by the Florida Digital Humanities Consortium <sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>. They also allow students to document their skills through the digital products of their work, as well as through the references their mentors can provide — because of the real-life work relationships involved, faculty who oversee the internships can often write letters of recommendation with a level of detail that is often not possible when a faculty member&rsquo;s knowledge of a student relates mainly to their performance in a classroom setting.</p>
<p>DH internships also hold value for mentors themselves, providing faculty a means to work with students in applied settings, an experience that is routine in many fields but is relatively rare in the humanities. Student collaborators can help faculty leaders discover new angles on their own research, including pedagogical applications that might not previously have been apparent. The opportunity to work with students in this capacity can also influence how faculty view their own roles and potential as educators, developing perspectives that may change how they teach in a more traditional format. These experiences can also provide a means for building relationships with cultural heritage and community institutions, as well as other faculty, whose expertise may be needed to make a particular internship possible.</p>
<p>Institutions themselves also stand to benefit from the promotion of this type of student experience. Colleges and universities today commonly promote their capacity to provide hands-on learning opportunities, and marketing materials frequently showcase images of students in science labs, on construction sites, and in other real-world settings. Because students working in humanities fields are seldom the focus of such representations, DH internships can offer rare opportunities to visualize the applied potential of humanistic scholarship. These experiences also present ways to showcase different types of student-faculty collaboration, as well as external partnerships. When handled properly, these internships can enable institutions to demonstrate their success at putting forth into the job market graduates with broad, diverse skill sets who can engage with ideas and technology in ways that are in demand across the economy.</p>
<p>These experiences can also benefit humanities programs themselves, which, as Lucas and Radia observe,  “yet again find themselves under fire, this time from government cutbacks and five-year strategic plans that strive to package scholarship as a marketable commodity commercialization of university education.”  As they argue, programs can find a way to compete in this environment by emphasizing the practical benefits of studies in the humanities:  “humanities programs stand to gain currency in the contemporary consumer economy if they embrace a more hands-on, creative, and service-driven approach to learning”   <sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="three-models">Three Models</h2>
<p>I propose three basic models for designing DH internships, categorized on the basis of whether two factors — the project and the work involved — existed prior to the involvement of the students in question. I use work here to refer either to labor (tasks to be done) or methodology (an approach to doing those tasks) or both. These hypothetical frameworks are not intended as fixed templates, but rather possible starting points for thinking about how to envision and structure this type of experience. In practice, an internship might combine more than one of these models, or present an entirely different profile.</p>
<p>I also illustrate model each with experiences that students completed at UNF between 2015 and 2021. With the exception of two that involved graduate students, all examples were carried out at the undergraduate level. For some of these internships I played an administrative role, as leader of the Digital Humanities Institute (2015-2019)<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>  and director of International Studies (2016-2022). For the rest, I served as mentor myself, in my capacity as coordinator of the digital editing projects coloniaLab (2016-present), Editing the Eartha MM White Collection (2016-present), and North Florida Editorial Workshop (2020-present), as well as my role as co-leader of the Viola Muse Digital Edition (2020-present).<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup></p>
<p>Because my focus is on internship design, not technology, I do not discuss tools when describing these examples. As a general rule, the projects that involve websites employ Omeka or WordPress, both of which are supported by the Center for Instruction and Research Technology (CIRT) at UNF. The digital editing projects discussed use both Omeka and TEI-XML, with the XML files displayed in customized installations of TEI Boilerplate. Any further information regarding tools for a particular project is provided in the notes.</p>
<p>For the purposes of these internships, I take an inclusive view of what DH means. I include work related to digital projects that may itself not necessarily be digital in nature, such as conducting secondary research. It could also include building websites and managing social media related to digital projects, activities that in many contexts might not be regarded as DH work, but the inclusion of which I believe to be valid in a pedagogical sense.</p>
<h2 id="existing-project-existing-work">Existing Project, Existing Work</h2>
<p>A student pursuing an internship is this category has been recruited to work on a project that has a defined existence. The student will receive training in doing something that someone else — most likely the project leader or a previous student intern — has done in the past. An overarching outcome can be defined as the completion of a certain task, or merely the total number of hours required as part of the internship.</p>
<p>Internships of this type offer several advantages. Because the conceptual work is already done, the student in this scenario can focus on exploring and mastering a methodology or a specific technology. Likewise, because the project is already established, this is perhaps the scenario in which students’ contributions are most likely to become part of a lasting, visible undertaking. Depending on the nature of the work and the previous knowledge of students, this potentially is the model that requires the least investment of time on the part the mentor. It is also perhaps the best fit for a student with limited previous experience, as that individual can be trained on discrete, compartmentalized aspects, without needing a global understanding of the endeavor. This is also a situation in which students can be tasked with training their own replacements, thereby creating potentially self–sustaining sequences of interns.</p>
<p>Several students at UNF have pursued internships of this nature with the digital editing workshop coloniaLab. Spanish/international studies major Buddy Delegal, Spanish major Kalthoum Elfasi, and political science/Spanish major Kathlina Brady assisted in the transcription and markup of manuscript from 1799 about Spanish expeditions to present-day British Columbia. Anthropology/Spanish major Teri Wilson and criminal justice/Spanish major Nicole Mills worked together to transcribe and encode part of a print volume from 1690 dealing with the geography of the Straits of Magellan. Ali Alsalman, a student in the Master of Arts in International Affairs, edited a section of the journal of an English voyage to Chile in the the late seventeenth century, a project that history major Marisa Pechillo later completed.<sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup></p>
<p>In some cases, the existing work carried out in this type of experience might involve engaging at a higher level on something that the same student had done previously in the context of a course. International studies/Spanish major Mariana Mendieta assisted in conducting a second round of work on a digital edition of an eighteenth-century legal case in Spanish related to witchcraft to which she and her peers contributed as part of digital-editing-on-site experience in Colombia.<sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>  Marisa Pechillo conducted higher-level editorial work and contextual research on the documents related to the history of North Florida that she and her classmates produced as part of a summer digital editing course in English.<sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup>  In a similar fashion, Amelia Dixon continued the editorial work she and her peers began on the Viola Muse Digital Edition as part of a separate iteration of that same summer course.<sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="existing-project-new-work">Existing Project, New Work</h2>
<p>A student pursuing an internship in this category is joining an existing project, but is tasked with adding something new. This could mean conceptualizing, designing, and/or implementing some novel aspect, or merely finding a way to implement a new facet that has been already conceived and/or designed by someone else. In whatever case, this internship involves an element of doing something new, in which the intern cannot be trained by someone already experienced in that exact work, in that exact context.</p>
<p>This second category offers some of the features of the first, while expanding the role of the student. By contributing to an existing project, a participant can reasonably expect that their work will become part of a larger, enduring undertaking. As the student is contributing to some new facet, the work can involve a degree of design and experimentation that goes beyond that which is involved in the first model. A student in this scenario may learn less about the implementation of a specific methodology or technology, but may have more exposure to the creative and project management aspects of digital humanities work. This model may require a higher degree of interaction between student and mentor, and a greater amount of uncertainty regarding the final products of the students&rsquo; work. Participants in these internships may need help identifying processes and tools that can be used to implement their goals. They might be able to train their successors, who might at that point be pursuing internships corresponding more to the first category.</p>
<p>Two students have completed this type of internship with Editing the Eartha M.M. White Collection, a collaborative project that makes available online the papers of the Eartha M.M. White, a key figure in the African American history of Jacksonville. History major Susan Williams helped to design and implement a pilot workshop series for the project, which had begun previously in the context of an undergraduate course. Williams&rsquo;s work aided in refocusing this endeavor to be not only about building a digital archive, but also experimenting with editing workshops as a mechanism for outreach and project continuity.<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup></p>
<p>Building upon Williams&rsquo;s work, history/Spanish major Carol Lynne Hemmingway later completed two internships as student leader of the Editing the Eartha M.M. White Collection. During the first, she created a website, a social media campaign, and interpretive materials for the project, including an exhibit on Omeka <sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>. She also designed and led a weekly open workshop series that drew student volunteers from across campus. During the second internship, she developed another Omeka exhibit <sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup> and organized several virtual workshops and other outreach events.<sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup></p>
<p>Victoria Farfán Lasso, a visiting student from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá, Colombia, also completed an internship focused largely on outreach for an existing project. Farfán Lasso built the website of the oral history project Voces y Caras: Hispanic Communities of North Florida. She was supervised by Dr. Constanza López Baquero, associate professor of Spanish, who started Voces y Caras 2012 and whose students contribute to the project each spring as part of a course for Heritage speakers of Spanish.<sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup></p>
<p>Pamela Martínez undertook an internship focused both on outreach and organizational development. She assisted in the creation of a website and social media presence for an international scholarly cooperative, the Alliance for Digital Research on Early Latin America (ADRELA). Her work involved corresponding in both English and Spanish with scholars throughout the United States and Latin America.<sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup></p>
<p>The internship of Trevor Cheatham, a graduate student in the Master of Arts in International Affairs, concentrated on the creation of project content. Cheatham helped to expand the project Enviro Rights Map, led by Dr. Josh Gellers, associate professor of political science. Cheatham gathered and incorporated material related to the right to water. He developed his own methodology for finding and evaluating provisions related to water rights from the constitutions of nations around the world, and added this information into the site.<sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup></p>
<p>International studies/political science major Zariah Grant completed an internship focused not on creating new content, but rather organizing and preparing existing material. Grant served as a research assistant for the Viola Muse Digital Edition, under the supervision of Dr. Laura Heffernan, associate professor of English and chair of the Digital Humanities Institute (2019-2021), and Dr. Tru Leverette, associate professor of English and director of the Africana Studies Program. As the first student to contribute this faculty-led project, Grant worked on the cataloguing and transcription of archival materials related to the fieldwork that Muse conducted for the Florida Office of the Negro Writers&rsquo; Project in Jacksonville the 1930s.<sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup></p>
<p>The experience of information science major Rachel Bennett was likewise oriented toward readying existing project content. Bennett assisted in developing and implementing a markup scheme for an interactive edition of a Spanish bibliography of the East and West Indies from 1629. She worked under the mentorship of Dr. Karthik Umapathy, associate professor of information systems.<sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="new-project">New Project</h2>
<p>A student in this scenario has been tasked with conceptualizing, designing, and potentially implementing something entirely new. A mentor provides guidance to help the intern determine the objectives of the project, consider methodologies and tools, make a plan for managing the design of the project and limiting its scope, and aids in gaining access to resources.</p>
<p>As this model focuses on the creation of a new undertaking, the emphasis is likely less on technology or implementation, and more on matters of project development. A finished product, beyond perhaps the creation of an ideally working prototype, is generally not the focus. This model may involve the highest level of mentor involvement, as students must be coached through the difficulties of starting a project from scratch, and may need assistance changing course and revising their plans. This is the model involving the most uncertainty, so the experience must be designed so that constructive failure can be an acceptable result.</p>
<p>This model can be divided into two categories, depending on whether the project has been initiated by the student or by the mentor. By student-initiated, I refer to a project for which the original concept came from the intern, even if the mentor played a role in helping to develop or shape that idea. Conversely, by mentor-initiated, I refer to projects for which the mentor has put forth the original idea, although student collaborators may end up helping to determine the direction of the project in important ways.</p>
<h2 id="student-initiated">Student-Initiated</h2>
<p>Internships in this category are often the continuation of student projects that began in a class setting. For instance, English major Sarah Dumitrascu built an experimental digital edition of a selection of an advanced typescript of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings&rsquo;s 1938 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel,  <em>The Yearling</em> , an undertaking she initiated in a summer digital editing course. Her project presents a version that allows the reader to explore Rawlings&rsquo;s revision process by isolating the various layers of typed and hand-written changes reflected in Rawling&rsquo;s draft. To do so, she developed a methodology for identifying and representing visually those different moments of revision.<sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">97</a></sup></p>
<p>In other cases, the project may not have originated in a previous class, but exposure to methodologies in such a setting provided a starting point. Following his experiences in a summer digital editing course, for example, history major Chad Germany developed The Civil War in St. Augustine as part of an internship with the St. Augustine Historical Society Research Library. This digital archive gathers images, letters, poems, and other textual material related to St. Augustine&rsquo;s role as an outpost for both the Confederate and Union armies. Germany worked under the mentorship of Bob Nawrocki, chief librarian at the St. Augustine Historical Society, as well as faculty mentor Dr. Charles Clossman, associate professor of history.<sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">98</a></sup></p>
<p>In a similar fashion, exercise science/Spanish major Emilia Thom participated in a summer digital editing course in Spanish, and then developed a project of her own as the basis of her internship. Thom constructed a prototype edition of archival materials related to interactions between colonists and Indigenous groups during the Second Spanish Period in Florida. She selected and transcribed the documents, marked them up, and published them online through coloniaLab.<sup id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">99</a></sup></p>
<p>Another example, but one that does not deal with an editing project, is that of international studies/vocal performance major Sarah Redlhammer, who created a prototype for an interactive map of heavy metal in a global context. Titled Mapping International Metal, Redlhammer&rsquo;s project involved developing a methodology for gathering data that would allow her to visualize the geography of the genre and its movement across borders. She built upon knowledge gained in a GIS course, and received guidance on her project from Dr. Chris Baynard, associate professor of geography and GIS.<sup id="fnref:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">100</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="mentor-initiated">Mentor-Initiated</h2>
<p>Internships in this category frequently come about when a faculty member recruits a student or students in response to a particular need or opportunity.</p>
<p>International studies/Spanish major Paulino Estévez-Ancira and Spanish major Melinda Peacock assisted in creating a prototype for a digital edition of Fernando de Montesinos&rsquo;s seventeenth-century manuscript  “Ophir de España,”  held at the University of Seville. Working from a transcription prepared previously by project leader Dr. Nathan Gordon of Adrian College, they translated a section of the document, and marked up both the transcription and translation for online publication. In the process, they also helped to identify shortcomings and oversights in the editorial criteria and project documentation.<sup id="fnref:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">101</a></sup></p>
<p>International studies majors Natalie Holland and Christopher Wilson and international studies/Spanish major Sarah Hollingsworth developed  <em>Visualizing Refugee Jacksonville</em> , a web resource exploring the experiences of refugee communities in North Florida. They designed objectives for the project and conducted research through oral interviews and use of the participatory method PhotoVoice. They built a prototype website through which to display the visual and textual materials they had gathered, and documented their efforts in a how–to guide for students who might continue this project in the future.<sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">102</a></sup></p>
<p>International studies/philosophy major Rebecca Weiner designed and built the Embroidering for Peace and Memory Digital Archive, another undertaking led by Dr. López Baquero. The project documents the embroidery pieces produced by students, faculty, staff, and community members as part of the Embroidering for Peace and Memory project, a week-long annual event at UNF since 2012. Weiner created digital photographs of over 200 pieces, developed a taxonomy for tagging them according to thematic and geographical factors, and built a website to make those materials available.<sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">103</a></sup>  International studies/Spanish major Angelic Fleites later worked with Dr. López Baquero to develop a social media campaign for this project, based in part on Weiner&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 id="general-observations">General Observations</h2>
<p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the question of delivery method did not arise for these internships. Experience has shown, however, that any of these models can work in a virtual format. Seven of the example internships discussed — those of Dixon, Dumitrascu, Estévez-Ancira, Grant, Hemmingway, Peacock and Pechillo — have been completely virtual due to the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic.<sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup>  The internships of Dixon, Dumitrascu, Pechillo, and Peacock, in fact, took place before I ever met those students in person.</p>
<p>Most of the examples mentioned here involved a UNF faculty member as supervisor, but these models can function for opportunities based also beyond the campus. For instance, the experiences of Germany; Holland, Hollingsworth, and Wilson; and Estévez-Ancira and Peacock, all involved supervision by mentors or advisors both at UNF and other institutions.</p>
<p>Regardless of the model employed, having students work in teams can often be a good strategy. This was the case with Mills and Wilson; Holland, Hollingsworth and Wilson; and Estévez-Ancira and Peacock. In all instances, the students were responsible for different materials and tasks, but they were able to assist each other in generating ideas, formulating questions, solving problems, and ensuring the accuracy of their work.</p>
<h2 id="logistical-aspects">Logistical Aspects</h2>
<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>Because all these models share characteristics, some general learning objectives can apply to all. These relate to communication skills, cross–disciplinary engagement, teamwork, and collaboration, as well as reflecting critically and constructively on successes and failures. Some examples include the following:<br>
explain project goals,   solve problems through research, experimentation and collaboration,   report accurately on time spent by task,   assess strengths and weaknesses of work produced, and   articulate personal impact of learning experience orally and in writing.</p>
<p>Objectives specific to the differing models can also be identified. To do so, we can regard the three models as representing a spectrum. At one end is Model 1, which focuses on the application of specific methodologies in the context of an existing endeavor. Objectives in this context may deal more with the development of particular skills. Desired outcomes might include the ability to do the following:<br>
analyze historical or social context of materials under consideration,   explain project methodologies,   apply project methodologies in processing of materials under consideration,   identify problems discovered in the application of project methodologies, and   propose ways to improve project processes.</p>
<p>In the middle, Model 2 is grounded in an existing project, but also involves tasks related to design and process management with respect to a specific aspect or feature. In this case, appropriate goals for learning might balance the attainment of particular skills with creative and critical abilities. Some possible outcomes might be to:<br>
identify a problem to be solved,   describe a potential solution,   indicate appropriate tools and methodologies,   articulate a work plan,   develop a proof-of-concept prototype,   critique that prototype,   implement proposed changes,   analyze results, and   determine next steps.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, Model 3 emphasizes the design of something entirely new and the management of related processes. In this case, desired outcomes might be more oriented toward the development of capacities for creative thinking and project solving. These might include the following:<br>
select materials to be examined,   identify questions to be answered in relation to those materials,   design an approach to answering such questions,   indicate appropriate tools and methodologies,   articulate a work plan,   develop a proof-of-concept prototype,   critique that prototype, and   determine next steps.</p>
<h2 id="semester-structure">Semester Structure</h2>
<p>The implementation of these internship models allows for flexibility and will vary by the nature of the project. With that in mind, I offer here a general structure that can be used as a point of departure.</p>
<p>For each internship model, at least one preliminary meeting prior to the beginning of the semester is needed to plan, set expectations, and handle any necessary paperwork. In all cases, the initial week can be an orientation period, which may involve more meetings for planning and training. The bulk of the semester can be organized into work time, punctuated by the completion of timesheets and weekly or biweekly status reports and meetings. The final weeks of the semester in each case should be dedicated to finalizing the students’ work, as appropriate, and reflecting on their students’ accomplishments and learning.</p>
<p>The following is a possible structure for the three types of internships. Because many aspects of the three models are identical, the distinguishing features of each are highlighted in bold. This outline assumes a 15-week semester, and so will need to be adjusted for terms of differing lengths.<br>
Model 1    Model 2    Model 3       Before semester   A preliminary meeting to discuss internship, provide initial orientation to project, set schedule for meetings and deadlines, discuss timesheets, status reports, etc., and sign agreement.    A preliminary meeting to discuss internship, provide initial orientation to project, set schedule for meetings and deadlines, discuss timesheets, status reports, etc., and sign agreement;  <strong>also, a preliminary brainstorming/design meeting</strong> .    A preliminary meeting to discuss internship, provide initial orientation to project, set schedule for meetings and deadlines, discuss timesheets, status reports, etc., and sign agreement;  <strong>also, a preliminary brainstorming/design meeting</strong>          Week 1    Orientation to project,  <strong>training session(s)</strong>      Orientation to project,  <strong>brainstorming/design session(s)</strong>      Orientation to project,  <strong>brainstorming/design session(s)</strong>          Weeks 2–12  Training, as needed; weekly or bi–weekly timesheets, status reports, and/or status meetings.  <strong>Weeks 10–12: focus on refinement and proofing of work</strong> .    Training, as needed; weekly or bi–weekly timesheets, status reports, and/or status meetings.  <strong>Items due: week 3, plan or proposal; week 6, initial prototype; week 9, revised prototype; week 12, second revised prototype</strong> .    Training, as needed; weekly or bi–weekly timesheets, status reports, and/or status meetings.  <strong>Items due: week 3, plan or proposal; week 6, initial prototype; week 9, revised prototype; week 12, second revised prototype</strong> .        Weeks 13-15    Final timesheet, completed work, reflective paper. Possibly: public presentation, recruitment and training of successor.    Final timesheet, completed work, reflective paper. Possibly: public presentation, recruitment and training of successor  <strong>(if development of this aspect of project to continue)</strong> .    Final timesheet, completed work, reflective paper. Possibly: public presentation, recruitment and training of successor  <strong>(if project to become ongoing)</strong> .    <br>
As suggested by this outline, the items to be delivered by students in these internships can vary, depending on the type. Most commonly, however, students will be producing proposals; periodic reports and/or learning journals; prototypes, possibly in various stages; and reflective papers.<sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup>  Tasks that might take place towards the end of the semester include public presentations and assistance in recruiting and training students to continue project work in a subsequent semester.</p>
<p>Ideally, the interns themselves can play a role in determining the structure of the semester. Some requirements may apply in all cases, such as the completion of a given number of hours and the submission of final reflections. Many other aspects of what the intern does and how they do it could be decided collaboratively.</p>
<h2 id="institutional-factors">Institutional Factors</h2>
<p>In order to offer digital humanities internships, several questions must be answered in terms of administrative structure and process. Needs will vary according to the circumstances of different institutions, but a few considerations generally apply.</p>
<p>A mechanism must be in place for awarding academic credit. In some cases, a student may be able to complete a digital humanities internship through a discipline–specific internship course. This may not be a solution for students in all majors, however, and relying on departmental areas to facilitate these experiences for an interdisciplinary community of students can be problematic. A digital humanities internship course that is not tied to or administered by one specific area can therefore be advantageous.</p>
<p>Students need a way to count that course toward a program of study. This could be a traditional major in a disciplinary area, and in such a case, the discipline–specific internship course, if one exists, is likely already included as an elective. In the case of a digital humanities internship course, however, the situation may be more complex. If a digital humanities major or minor exists, the digital humanities internship course will almost certainly count toward those programs of study. In some instances, traditional departments may agree to honor the digital humanities internship course also as an elective toward their degrees, although likely on a case-by-case basis. Ideally, students could double–count such a course between a traditional major or minor and a digital humanities major or minor.<sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup></p>
<p>Thirdly, a system must exist through which students can propose or apply for these internships, and upon approval, receive the needed registration permissions. If the internship occurs within a disciplinary area, this will likely be done through whatever processes are already in place. In the case of a digital humanities internship course that is not discipline-specific, however, such a system may need to be centralized. The responsible individual could be the coordinator of digital humanities minor or major, or the director of a digital humanities center or institute.</p>
<p>Funding for interns is desirable, particularly in situations in which the student&rsquo;s work can be understood as labor for a project owned by someone else. This will generally be true in all cases except possibly the student-initiated projects under Model 3. As UCLA’s Digital Humanities program states in  “A Student Collaborators&rsquo; Bill of Rights,”  receiving academic credit for work on digital projects is not adequate:  “Course credit is generally not sufficient  payment  for students’ time, since courses are designed to provide students with learning experiences”   <sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To some extent, however, this depends on the nature of the work and the role of a given student. UCLA’s statement frames the issue as follows:  “As a general principle, a student must be paid for his or her time if he or she is not empowered to make critical decisions about the intellectual design of a project or a portion of a project (and credited accordingly). Students should not perform mechanical labor, such as data-entry or scanning, without pay”   <sup id="fnref1:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup>. Model 1 might involve a student doing tasks that could be understood to be mechanical, though such activities arguably correspond more to a paid student assistant position, not an internship (paid or otherwise) involving academic credit. In general, the internships contemplated in this article are of a nature in which students are regarded as collaborators, not employees, and the power to make decisions is a basic part of that role. This distinction notwithstanding, helping students secure funding to support their internships will seldom be an inappropriate or superfluous act on the part of the mentor or a digital humanities center, institute, or program.<sup id="fnref:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">108</a></sup></p>
<p>Regardless of the ability to fund students&rsquo; work, a commitment should exist among project leaders to properly credit those efforts. As the 2011  “Collaborators’ Bill of Rights”  states this matter:  “All kinds of work on a project are equally deserving of credit (though the amount of work and expression of credit may differ).”  Beyond being a question of fairness with respect to individual students, such a stance has larger implications, as acknowledging and celebrating student contributions can be a central factor in building dynamic DH communities <sup id="fnref:109"><a href="#fn:109" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">109</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having on-campus forums in which students can present their work is also beneficial. At UNF, the Digital Humanities Institute sponsors a Digital Project Showcase towards the end of each fall semester, and SOARS, the campus-wide undergraduate research symposium takes place at the conclusion of each spring semester.<sup id="fnref:110"><a href="#fn:110" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">110</a></sup>  Nearly all of the interns mentioned in this article have discussed their experiences at one or both of these events.</p>
<p>A system for compensating faculty mentors, or otherwise incentivizing their participation, is beneficial. Such compensation might take take the form of a stipend or release time, perhaps after mentoring a given number of students. The possible options must, of course, be dictated by the particular circumstances of each institution.<sup id="fnref:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">111</a></sup></p>
<p>At a minimum, an institution hoping to enable this type of student experience must express formal support for interdisciplinary mentorship. Faculty who are subject to tenure and promotion otherwise risk being seen as not contributing adequately to their own areas, particularly when they find themselves working with students from other majors. Legitimizing such activity through explicit support in departmental bylaws and university statutes, as well as collective bargaining agreements, as appropriate, is an important step toward creating the types of cross-disciplinary spaces needed to facilitate internships like those discussed here.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The internship model described in this paper promises a broad range of benefits for students. Participants can gain technical skills and a deeper understanding of methodologies used to ask questions and solve problems in a variety of fields. These opportunities provide a way to develop abilities related to critical thinking, planning, organization, and communication skills. Students can include these experiences on their resumes, and can discuss them in concrete ways when applying to jobs or graduate programs.</p>
<p>Faculty likewise can benefit from their role in mentoring digital humanities internships for students. Many will be able to involve students in digital projects related to their own research. Such collaborations can allow faculty to see their work from new perspectives, and can give their research greater visibility on campus. These experiences can also alter how faculty approach teaching in a more traditional classroom setting.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, institutional units — programs, departments, colleges, and universities themselves — stand to benefit from having students engaged in digital humanities internships. These experiences create avenues for collaboration across disciplinary lines, resulting in experiences that can have implications for faculty satisfaction, the development of creative new initiatives, the overall quality of education, and the employability of graduates. These internships can provide opportunities for administrators to showcase the creativity and talent of students and faculty, and the quality of student/faculty interactions.</p>
<p>Even the most hospitable of institutional settings will likely present challenges to be overcome when attempting to offer opportunities of this sort. However, the model described here can be deployed on a trial basis without significant resources or administrative support. A small community of core faculty can experiment with offering digital humanities internships in a way that can attract attention and create greater momentum. The effort and risk involved may be justified, as the potential benefits are many. Students, faculty, and institutions all stand to gain from the implementation of experiential, project–based learning opportunities within the context of digital humanities research.</p>

<p>If additional compensation or release time are not options, one possibility might be to frame the internships of a full cohort of students as a studio course, with one faculty member serving as instructor of record within their normal teaching load. Such an approach will depend, of course, on the viability of attaining a sufficient number of students to adequately enroll such a course. While this strategy may solve an administrative problem, however, it may also create another of a pedagogical nature, as in this scenario the instructor of record would likely function as mentor to all the students.

<p>Because of the digital revolution&hellip; all kinds of things are happening [in humanities research], and [ <em>Circulating Spaces</em> ] is one example&hellip; [ <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  and its] ecosystem of literary worlds are creating new mechanisms for both doing and disseminating research and having conversations about it that didn’t exist when I was a graduate student. So [ <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  — and podcasts like it – are] the wave of the future.<br>
Susan Stanford Friedman,  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  Episode 6, 38:35-39:08 <br>
Highlighting the renewed impetus for the kind of collaborative humanities research made possible by Digital Humanities initiatives, Susan Stanford Friedman describes how the  “ecosystem of literary worlds”  — including the attendant technologies or media that make the production of literature possible — is revolutionizing the academic  “mechanisms for both doing and disseminating research.”  Digital Humanities scholarship poses foundational questions regarding how new forms of digital media can inform, challenge, and change the ways we do scholarship in the academy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  In this article, we consider how the podcast, as an emerging form of scholarship and research in the academy, engages with these central inquiries of the Digital Humanities. We offer our own experiences in creating, producing, and publishing the podcast series,  <em>Circulating Spaces: Literary and Language Worlds in a Global Age</em> , as a case study, and we reflect on how the podcast has amended our practices as researchers, editors, and scholars. Specifically, we leveraged theories developing in the field of world literature with the affordances of the podcast as a medium to create a series of podcast episodes that attempts to deconstruct the existing binary between the public and the academy within academic thought.  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  models a complex network of relations by highlighting topics and featuring guests who co-exist within these spaces. In turn, precisely because it allows us to consider (and serve as engaged participants in) the more complex lives of the actors involved within the multiple ecosystems of literary worlds, we contend that the podcast serves as an alternative method of conducting and pursuing academic research in an increasingly collaborative, increasingly global era.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We begin by looking at the development of the podcast as a distinct form of media that emphasizes consistency in presentation style and theme in order to develop an audience, within the academy as well as beyond it. We then turn to discussing  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  as a case study that intervenes within discourses around public humanities: it helps to reshape the publics of academia by breaking down the binary between the public and academic; and to point toward ways in which more nuanced networks of affinity between the academy and the public may be constructed and negotiated by embracing the digital and the open. Finally, we locate our work within the fields of digital scholarship and the Digital Humanities more specifically in order to understand the work accomplished by non-traditional forms of scholarship.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-podcasts-as-media">Part 1: Podcasts as Media</h2>
<h2 id="a--characterizing-the-podcasts-form-and-affordances">A.   Characterizing the Podcast’s Form and Affordances</h2>
<p>The term podcast is an amalgam of the words iPod and broadcast, and technically speaking, the podcast is simply a digital audio file that people can download from the Internet. But in recent years, the podcast has developed into a distinct form with its own set of rules. The most essential rule of successful podcast production is to make the show interesting enough to keep an audience’s attention. Charli Prangley writes,  “Building an audience is all about consistency. Consistency in the topics you talk about. Consistency in the style of photographs on your blog. Consistency in the frequency of when you&rsquo;ll post new content. And for podcasts, consistency in your show format”   <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. As Prangley notes, most podcasts are serial, and each podcast series tends to explore or develop a topic or theme from different angles (similar to a TV series, which features the same characters often engaging in similar activities or facing similar tasks).</p>
<p>There are currently three primary podcast forms: the solo podcast, the storytelling podcast (both fiction and non-fiction), and the conversational podcast (featuring at least one host and one or more guests).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  While there are thus several different styles of podcasts, each of these has developed into a recognizable form that has its own set of rules or conventions. The solo podcast may seem similar to the standard academic lecture. Yet the need to keep an audience engaged across multiple broadcasts without listening aids (such as an accompanying PowerPoint or other video supplements) has resulted in a change to the strategy of delivery: hosts of solo podcasts often use the platform to speak to their audience in a much more informal yet sustained way. Rachel Corbett of  <em>PodSchool</em>  has emphasized the need for solo podcasters to continuously vamp up the energy of their shows, stating that a solo podcast is  “a very intimate way to get to know your audience because you are&hellip;talking directly to your audience&hellip;[The audience] need[s] to feel like they know you and that they can trust you”  (<a href="#corbett"> “Different Types of Podcast”  8:09-8:25, 11:17-11:24</a>). But this style of podcast  “can be tough”  to create because it can be difficult  “to get that energy and to get that conversational style happening”  (<a href="#corbett"> “Different Types of Podcast”  11:27-11:36</a>). This presentation style differs markedly from that of the academic lecture, which often features a live audience that can see and respond to the presenter’s gestures, facial expressions, and any supplementary visual aids.</p>
<p>The storytelling podcast includes both non-fiction storytelling (such as the investigative journalism of  <em>This American Life</em>  or  <em>Serial</em> ) and fictional storytelling. Both of these formats differ from audiobooks in that they incorporate a variety of sound effects and voices rather than relying upon a single narrator. Corbett explains that storytelling podcasts include  “the added element of sound design,”  such as grabs of interviews, ambient sound, phone conversations, and more (<a href="#corbett"> “Different Types of Podcast”  20:38-20:42</a>). Specifically referring to fiction storytelling podcasts, Corbett states:  “[These podcasts necessitate] more than just somebody reading the story into a microphone. It’s got to be audio storytelling. &hellip;You need someone who’s going to do a voiceover and really in some ways act out the story rather than just reading it”  (<a href="#corbett"> “Different Types of Podcast”  22:32-22:43, 22:51-22:57</a>). </p>
<p><em>Circulating Spaces</em>  is an example of the last type, the conversational podcast. The conversational podcast has several different formats, including the interview show and the panel discussion, but each of these generally involves some combination of hosts and guests who dialogue about a topic or event. In the conversational form of the podcast, the host(s) tend to remain fairly constant throughout a podcast series; guests, on the other hand, generally change from episode to episode. The goal of the conversational podcast is to generate discussions new and interesting enough to retain the audience.</p>
<h2 id="b-podcasts-in-the-academy">B. Podcasts in the Academy</h2>
<p>A number of studies have outlined the usefulness and efficacy of podcasts as pedagogical tools. Khe Foon Hew identifies the most common use of the podcast in the academy as a method for distributing course content. Instructors can share  “podcast recordings of lectures or supplementary materials for students to review subject material at their own time and place”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. As one might expect with this use of podcasts, Simon Fietze has argued that because students can listen to podcasts multiple times, podcasts can help students  “assimilate the contents of lectures better and more efficiently”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These conclusions certainly stand to reason. However, scholarly analyses of podcasts have largely been limited to understanding how the podcast — which has been strictly considered as a means of communicating information — impacts students’ retention of that information. In so limiting the purpose of podcasts within higher education, these analyses often relegate podcasts to mere recordings of lectures or information that can then be used to assist in content retention and  “distance learning”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Yet more recently, there have been shifts toward scholarly analyses of the podcast beyond its uses within a pedagogical context.  <em>Podcasting: New Aural Cultures and Digital Media</em>  (2018), an edited collection of interdisciplinary essays, and  <em>Podcasting: The Audio Media Revolution</em>  (2019) are two recent academic works responding to what is being termed as the golden age of podcasting. The former is among the first such collections to critically examine the podcast within the context of digital media and cultural studies. The latter work studies several prominent podcast series in order to probe the distinctive characteristics of the podcast form. Both volumes argue for the uniqueness of the podcast as a creative medium and its consequent potential for influencing the way knowledge is produced and communicated; they also explore the specific meaning-making frameworks employed by the medium. </p>
<p>This shift in direction of inquiry is important, since podcasts encompass a diverse range of production strategies. Some of the most popular literary podcasts, for instance, include  <em>The New Yorker</em> ’s Fiction Podcast series, which is hosted by Deborah Treisman and regularly features a reading by and discussion with a contemporary author;  <em>Dear Book Nerd</em>  (2014-2016), which was hosted by librarian Rita Meade and brought in guests to answer listeners’ questions about reading, writing, and publishing practices; and TinHouse and KBOO’s  <em>Between the Covers</em>  which is hosted by David Naimon and features in-depth interviews with contemporary American writers. Thus, given the changing face of the podcast and its increasing use to promote and disseminate scholarly content, it has become necessary to reassess the role and affordances of the podcast within the academy.</p>
<p>In the last ten years, academic podcasts such as the  <em>University of Oxford Podcasts: World Literature</em>  series (2012-2016) have begun to extend the function of the podcast out beyond the walls of the academy. An example of an early form of the academic podcast, this series was simply a collection of recorded guest lectures, and the character of these lectures is explicitly academic. The series focused on different kinds of world literature, such as world literature and the Pan-Asian Empire and the status of African literature. Yet even though it reproduced live lectures in recorded form, the  <em>University of Oxford Podcasts: World Literature</em>  series differs from that of other recorded lectures in that its aim was not to aid in  <em>student</em>  course-material retention, but rather to disseminate these lectures by well-known academics to a larger audience beyond the University of Oxford community. The series also capitalized on the easy (and free) circulation of the podcast as a medium to increase these lectures’ circulation. In doing so, the creators used the digital affordances of the podcast to expand the usefulness of the podcast beyond the university classroom. The podcast thus fulfilled an aim of what we might consider public humanities, the engagement of a broader and more diverse set of publics.</p>
<p><em>Public Work</em> , a podcast series at Brown University produced and hosted by Jim McGrath and Amelia Golcheski, offers an alternative conception of the purpose of the podcast by focusing explicitly on public humanities engagement. By doing public humanities outreach,  <em>Public Work</em>  revolves around  “education, research, and public engagement initiatives that connect individuals and communities to art, history, and culture.”  Rather than either recording or disseminating university lectures, this podcast series attempts to engage public communities in conversation on both local and regional levels by broadening the scope of educational research and the range of focal institutions. In doing so, it also brings the community into the academy.</p>
<p>As podcasts like  <em>Public Work</em>  evidence, the podcast is now a tool used widely by both academic and non-academic institutions; as such, the podcast has intimate ties to the field of public humanities, particularly given the fact that it can be circulated easily and without much cost to subscribers (if its producers so choose). Given both this changing understanding of the podcast as a distinct medium with its own set of rules and the podcast’s unique role in connecting the academy and the wider public, we launched  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  to consider questions of longstanding, but increasingly vital, significance: As academics, to whom is our research useful? In other words, who are we in conversation with? How can we involve non-academics in our research? In the production of the podcast, we observed the mutually reinforcing confluence of three fields — public humanities, world literature, and the Digital Humanities (DH) — which together offer a vision for altering the future of humanities scholarship by encouraging more collaborative work and research methods.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-circulating-spaces-as-case-study">Part 2: Circulating Spaces as Case Study</h2>
<p><em>Circulating Spaces</em>  (2017-2019) was hosted, recorded, and produced by the authors of this essay, Christian Howard-Sukhil (née Howard), Samantha Wallace, and Ankita Chakrabarty. The podcast ran for two seasons and has twelve episodes. Season one (episodes one through seven) was co-hosted by Christian Howard-Sukhil and Samantha Wallace. Season two (episodes eight through twelve) was co-hosted by Christian Howard-Sukhil and Ankita Chakrabarty. The episodes continue to be freely accessible on iTunes and the project website.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Each episode features a new guest (or guests) who is asked to speak about her relationship to the field of world literature, her background within various disciplines, how her work intersects with conceptions of the public, and (one author’s favorite section) about new literature she recommends. Our guests have included Erin Bartnett, then a literary agent, now an editor for  <em>Electric Literature</em> ; Brandon Butler, the University of Virginia’s Director of Information Policy and an attorney whose expertise includes copyright and fair use; A.D. Carson, a hip-hop artist and Professor of Hip-Hop and the Global South at the University of Virginia; Lã Linh Chi, a Vietnamese-English teacher and translator; Amitav Ghosh, an award-winning English-language writer; Susan Stanford Friedman, Professor of English and Women and Gender Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Favianna Rodriguez, a transdisciplinary artist and social justice advocate; and Nathan Rostron, editor and marketing director of the publishing company, Restless Books. Because the technology required to host a recorded interview — a working microphone, some sort of transition technology (such as Skype or Zoom), a computer, and recording software — were relatively accessible, we were able to interview a wider range of guests than we would have been able to had we been restricted to in-person interviews; such accessibility allowed us to connect to a wider network of people and practitioners around the globe.</p>
<p>In each episode, we aimed to produce an atmosphere of casual conversation with each of our guests. We hoped our interactions felt intimate, off-the-cuff, and unrevised, as if we were over coffee and in-person discussing issues important to us. This tone is immediately evident in the podcast episodes: where a transcript might not, the audio recording picks up our pauses and hesitations, fluctuations of laughter, collisions of speech, the vagaries of sound traveling across several different mics and recording devices, and verbal ticks, in addition to the content of our comments. Guests changed their minds or revised mid-speech. Some of their ideas were, in this way, very clearly works-in-progress. Furthermore, in editing the episodes after each recording, we strove to retain the verisimilitude of our conversations by leaving in any awkward pauses and verbal ticks, as well as our guests’ unscripted responses. We did so in order to reproduce the effect of a casual conversation, but also to co-construct a work that differs in kind and in style from the more manicured prose of, say, an academic essay. These conversations gain from retaining their unrevised style in that this stylistic messiness comments on the (often unmarked and therefore invisible) number of revisions that go into a work of scholarship. Our unrevised conversations thus allowed us to embark on work that felt more spontaneous and less polished than our written academic work.</p>
<p><em>Circulating Spaces</em>  was produced as a part of the Graduate Student Public Humanities Lab at the Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures at the University of Virginia. The Graduate Student Public Humanities Lab was founded in 2017 to address the gap we saw dividing our scholarly work from the broader public. The Lab aims to develop collaboration among departments; to address the issues dividing the University of Virginia from the city of Charlottesville through working groups dedicated to specific projects in the community; and to provide a common space for scholars and the wider community to generate lively discussion, research, and advocacy initiatives.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  In doing so, the Lab sought to interrogate the way the public is perceived as separate from the academy and often simplified within this binary through a lack of nuance by examining this term as a construct: What is the public? How is it separate from the academy? In what ways do the public and the academy inform one another? In what circumstances is this opposition a false binary, and in what circumstances is it an important distinction to make? </p>
<p>Posing questions about the perceived gap between the public and the academy links our inquiry with the work of public humanities. The aim, as Sheila Brennan points out in  “Public, First”  is to  “place communities, or other public audiences, at their core.”  A field that arose within the last fifty years, public humanities is most commonly understood to have developed in response to  “conservative critiques of the obscurantism and leftism of the academy”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Public humanities, initially at least, [ “aspired] to democratize humanistic knowledge by transforming the capacities of academic humanists and their work in and out of the university”   <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. While in its earliest stages it was used to convince academics to write for an audience broader than other academics, by the late 1990s, it was academics who were leveraging the phrase to advocate for  “alternative methods of engagement against reigning paradigms of humanistic inquiry”   <sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. What this meant was engaging in more research with practical applications. As Robyn Schroeder writes, academics  “moved, quickly, to learn from the methods of social scientistic ethnographers, oral historians, and journalists, as well as from curators, museum educators, genealogists and documentary film makers, and to aggregate those knowledges together under the  public humanities  tent”   <sup id="fnref3:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The rationale for public humanities is still alive and well. In the twenty-first century, public humanities has itself become a formal field of academic study, with a home within elite institutions such as Yale and Brown, and in which students can receive advanced degrees. Additionally, it continues to inflect arguments around the role of the humanities within society. In her recent book  <em>Generous Thinking</em> , Kathleen Fitzpatrick in invokes the spirit of public humanities as a way of repairing the perceived current divide between the academy and the public, a divide that she characterizes as rampant with anti-intellectualism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In public scholarship, members of our chosen communities enter into our projects not just as readers but as participants, as stakeholders, and as partners. Public scholarship allows the venues for engaging with those communities to expand beyond the monograph or the journal article to include a range of forms in which the publics with / whom we work can engage directly with the materials of our fields.<br>
<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Fitzpatrick lists alternative spaces of scholarly engagement beyond the traditional modes of academic publications to include museum and gallery exhibitions, interactive web archives and other community-oriented publication models that are currently being developed, and notes that the inclusion of such spaces diversify the possibilities of building connections and networks. Thus, as contested as it is ambiguous a term, public humanities continues to depend on — as it interrogates — a perceived dialogue between the academy and the public — the circulation of humanistic knowledges between grounds and people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Circulating Spaces</em>  reassesses and expands the concept of public by exploring what it means to engage with literature as a global-scale community. We were interested early on in illuminating the complicated network of the academy and its counterparts that our podcast guests chart. It is not only literature, but also  <em>people</em>  who circulate in, out, and around institutions adjacent to the academy, as many of our guests on the show articulate when describing their career trajectories. The podcast’s self-conscious positioning at the intersection of public humanities and world literature provided  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  with both its raison d’être and its conceptual framework: the former provided the goal of expanding the concept of what constitutes a public by developing a more complicated theory of the public through recent developments in the field of world literature.</p>
<p><em>Circulating Spaces</em>  not only uses the affordances of the form of the podcast to inform its content. It engages with the conceptual and theoretical paradigms developed recently in the field of world literature — focusing on circulation, motion, and (trans)nationalism — in order to reconfigure the form and function of the podcast within the academy. According to the Warwick Research Collective,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global/world literature in its pre-eminent contemporary formulation pushes intrinsically in the directions of commerce and commonality, linkage and connection, articulation and integration, network and system. It thereby distances itself, explicitly or implicitly, from the antecedent lexicon of post-theory, which had been disposed to emphasize not comparison but incommensurability, not commonality but difference, not system but untotalizable fragment.<br>
<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Similarly, Alexander Beecroft, through his concept of ecologies of world literature, sees most scholars of world literature not as articulating  “competing models for understanding how literature circulates, but rather [as articulating] different concrete answers, emerging in specific contexts, to the same set of problems about the interactions between literatures and their environments”   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. In short, by reinterpreting the scope of the public humanities through conceptions developed in world literature,  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  not only bridges the divide between academic podcasts (such as the  <em>University of Oxford Podcasts: World Literature</em>  series) and public humanities podcasts (such as  <em>Public Works</em> ), but it actively connects the dots between academic institutions and those of us who work within and circulate around them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guided by this world literature model,  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  likewise attempts to point toward ways in which networks of affinity between the academy and the public may be constructed and negotiated. All too often, the public humanities model creates a hierarchical relationship in which the academy intervenes in public spaces in order to share research or offer their insights on an issue. We oppose this hierarchical model and instead advocate for a more connected and fluid understanding of the ways in which individuals circulate around various institutions linked with the academy.  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  presents a model of the academy that is not unilateral (as if the academy were one, static space), but that instead highlights the ways individuals circulate around various institutions connected to the academy. For instance, we saw how Sarah Rodriguez moved from the University of Virginia to an elementary school classroom; how Erin Barnett transitioned to a literary agency; and how Brandon Butler went from law school to a university library. As we traced a rhizomatic network of connections between guests, ideas, and world literature texts made possible through the technology of the podcast, it became ever clearer to us that the divide between the academy and the public was not only a false divide, but one that is not intellectually productive or even necessarily accurate. For example, despite moving out of academia, many of our guests, such as Erin Bartnett, Sarah Rodriguez, and Brandon Butler, have careers that intersect with the academy. Their circulation — and the ideas they take with them — belies the strict divide between the academy and the public. People, ideas, and spaces, as world literature theory has argued, are much more fluid.</p>

<p>While the public humanities and developments in world literature have informed the purpose and scope of  <em>Circulating Spaces</em> , the Digital Humanities (DH) provide us with a useful model for how to frame the kind of scholarship that podcasts like  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  can accomplish. At first glance, it might appear that discussions about the podcast — an innately digital medium — belong more broadly to the field of digital scholarship rather than the Digital Humanities. After all, at many institutions, DH is subsumed under the larger initiative of digital scholarship. Loyola Marymount University, for instance, describes the relationship between digital scholarship and the Digital Humanities thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital scholarship (DS) and Digital Humanities (DH) are scholarly activities that involve the extensive use of digital methods and tools to conduct research, analyze data, and present scholarship. &hellip;Digital humanities may be seen as falling under the umbrella of digital scholarship. It involves using digital tools and methods to analyze, synthesize, present and teach humanities scholarship.<br>
<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> According to definitions such as this, DH is a subset of — and differentiated from — digital scholarship more broadly simply on the basis of its focus on humanities subjects.  <em>Circulating Spaces</em> , which broadly considers issues related to global literary circulation, would thus only be a DH project because the production strategy is digital even as the subject matter of the podcast is humanities-based. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is an additional element of DH scholarship that expands the function of this field. That is, more than simply using technology to focus on or address humanities-based questions, DH has a charge to reflect critically upon  “how digital information technologies influence perspectives in and on research in the humanities”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Alan Liu puts this imperative in slightly different terms by highlighting the need of Digital Humanities work to both  “assist mainstream humanities critique”  and to  “use technology self-reflexively as part of the very condition, and not just facility, of critically knowing and acting on culture today”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Thus, while  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  may participate in DH and be classified as a DH project simply in reference to its method of production and entanglement with humanities-related questions,  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  is more explicitly enmeshed in the work of DH through its questioning of how the podcast as a tool helps us reevaluate scholarly processes and the production of humanities scholarship.</p>
<p>In fact, DH scholars have long discussed the need to expand what constitutes scholarship, especially when it comes to tenure and promotion review.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  In  “Episode 3: Public and Digital Spaces,”  Brandon Walsh, the Head of Student Programs in the University of Virginia’s Scholars’ Lab, discusses how digital technology is changing how we conceive of humanities scholarship.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  As Walsh puts it, DH scholarship not only  “gives you a different means of disseminating things,”  but it also requires that  “you&hellip;think in a different way”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. For Walsh, this means specifically that he thinks more publicly. He explains more fully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past several years that I’ve been working in Digital Humanities, probably the most profound shift in how I work is that it’s all public all the time. So whenever I teach or am working and thinking through a problem, I try and think about how I might reframe that for a public audience, like either in a blog or gathering my materials together so that other people can see them. And that’s not something that I was necessarily thinking about during the rest of my time as a graduate student. …Working in an increasing digital space for me has meant that you have to be willing to put yourself out there.<br>
<sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> By being, as Walsh puts it,  “public all the time,”  Digital Humanities has pushed Walsh to consider public engagement with his own research. As we’ve argued, a model for academic work that is public shouldn’t merely be public-facing; it should make visible the intricate connections between people and ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friedman too points out in her episode <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> that fields such as Digital Humanities and world literature urge us to rethink and to alter our academic practices. Acknowledging the move toward collaborative scholarship in the humanities, she states that efforts are currently under way to support more communal academic projects.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  However, while journals, including  <em>PMLA</em> , increasingly feature author interviews,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  which could be compared to the work of podcast interviews (esp. see <a href="#howard2018g"> <em>Circulating Spaces</em> , Episode 10</a>, which features an interview with author Amitav Ghosh), these published, written interviews are short (generally running between three and six pages) and tend to polish the voices of both author and interviewer. Additionally, the work of the interviewer in researching and preparing questions often receives only a passing acknowledgment.</p>
<p>This is precisely where the affordances of digital humanities can come into play. Podcasts like  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  offer a different take on ideas of community engagement and conversation in terms of academic publishing. Indeed, the form of conversation afforded by the podcast stands in counterpoint to the model of the single-author scholarly monograph, which continues to be the gold-standard for academic work despite shrinking university library budgets and rising costs associated with traditional publication. The processes of research and publication occur almost simultaneously during the creation of the podcast itself. This is significant because the podcast’s immediacy and informality suggest a model of publication that is less hierarchical than traditional scholarly publishing. Even the sheer number of contributors to  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  challenges the traditional model for authorship of traditional humanities research. More so, podcast interviews record voice intonation and pauses, providing a richer experience and giving voice to both interviewer and interviewee alike. The immediacy and informality of the voices in such conversations not only distinguish the podcast from the traditional scholarly monograph, but also put into relief the otherwise invisible work of drafting and revision that goes into the scholarly monograph. In short, the podcast does work that the scholarly monograph does not — work that should not replace, but rather stand as a companion to the scholarly monograph.</p>
<p>Podcasts, given the relative ease of collaboration even across distances, also lend themselves well to community or collaborative development. Llinares, Fox, and Berry locate the transformative potential of the collaborative podcast within  “the medium’s hybridity of thought, sound and text”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. These features  “perhaps even foster a reinvigoration of the dialectic, an exchange of ideas beyond what is possible in purely written form — be it in a magazine or academic journal. Podcasting, for us, taps into something fundamental about oral communication, argument and even the tension between subjective and objective knowledge that has been amplified in the digital age”   <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. In addition to being visibly co-produced projects, the conversational nature of the podcast captures the popularity of oral forms of communication in the digital age.</p>
<p>Taken together, the podcast’s public, communal, and conversational affordances make it possible for subsequent episodes to build on the preceding episodes’ conversations with relative ease. In this manner,  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  brings together Favianna Rodriguez, an interdisciplinary artist ( “Episode 11: Designing Global Activism” ) and Amitav Ghosh, a novelist and climate-change activist ( “Episode 10: The Climate of World Literature” ) into conversational proximity. Ghosh expresses surprise and dismay at the conspicuous absence of climate change in contemporary global fiction, and he stresses the critical need for contemporary fiction to engage in the discourse of climate change in the present time <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. During the following episode, with Ghosh’s comments in mind, the co-hosts asks Rodriguez to comment upon the role of climate change in her artwork. Rodriguez concurs with Ghosh’s assertion that there is a lack of art about non-human subjects <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. She further states:  “We can help to transform the current course, and in order to do that we need to just feel our stories in relation to nature&hellip;This is why, actually, I am so serious about creating art with plants and with climate, and I am a beacon now because I want to share these stories”   <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Rodriguez’s interest in the imagery of nature in contemporary art resonates strongly with Ghosh’s call for contemporary fiction to wake up to the realities of the time, as evidenced by her enthusiastic and hearty endorsement of Ghosh’s emphasis upon the necessity of storytelling in helping combat climate change. The conversations in the podcast episodes thus become multi-directional, not simply in terms of the movement of ideas and opinions, but in the very process of conceptualization. In this way, each conversation can become intricately connected to the larger conversation that the podcast series, as a whole, constructs.</p>
<p>Finally, podcasts such as  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  participate in the  “new scholarly digital ethos”  in another distinct way, namely, through their commitment to open access <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. If digital technologies make dissemination relatively easy, and if, as we’ve argued, the networks between the academy and neighboring institutions are constituted by individuals who circulate between these institutions, do we not have an obligation to make the results of our academic labor open and accessible to as broad a public as possible? Shouldn’t we honor, through open accessibility, the collaborative relationships established by work like  <em>Circulating Spaces</em> ?</p>
<p>Brandon Butler, the University of Virginia’s Director of Information Policy, breaks down the case for open access in  “Episode 5: Copyright and Open Access:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We now have… two things that make possible what was not possible before. We have the technology to make all knowledge instantly and very, very cheaply, essentially freely available to anyone, anywhere. And we have a community of people&hellip;who make knowledge for a living and who don’t expect to get paid by the readers who read it&hellip; So, we can have a publishing system that does not need to pay authors. All we have to do is find a way to finance the marginal cost of distributing something on the Internet. And it’s nothing!&hellip; And so, all [open access does is] put two and two together, and say all scholarly literature should be freely available on the web to anyone with an internet connection.<br>
<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> We agree with Butler and argue that the open sharing of scholarship will be mutually beneficial, especially as it pertains to scholarly work such as a podcast, which can be produced with low overhead cost, is relatively cheap to maintain, and can easily be made open access, that is, freely available without the cost of subscription.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  Doing so will help encourage collaborative research; adequately reflect and make visible the complex network of people and ideas that circulate in the broad ecosystem of humanities work; and encourage, as Walsh indicated, scholars to consider broader audiences for their research, in a time in which the value of the humanities is often debated.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  As Walsh, Friedman, and Butler all imply, scholars in fields as diverse as world literature, public humanities, and the Digital Humanities are all pointing individually toward this conclusion.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  It is a work in progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>
<p>         As the outcome of an academic lab model of collaborative research, we have not been particularly mindful about the number of subscribers  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  gained during the course of its production. While statistics detailing subscribers, downloads, etc., can be helpful indicators of the growing influence of a podcast, our criteria for success was based on the production process itself — the development of the theoretical framework for the podcast, constructing the episode outlines and the interview questions, and networking and collaborating with a diverse group of individuals all working broadly within the humanities.  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  has also established networks of connection which continue to persist and can be worked upon and expanded in the future.</p>
<p>While our assessment of the podcast’s participation in this new way of thinking of and conducting research has been largely celebratory — indeed, we consider collaboration as well as research and publication that is more democratic and spontaneous to be of obvious positive value — it is important to consider the shortcomings and limitations of such projects as well. We want to be particularly cognizant of and transparent regarding how the academy has structured our own social networks and therefore the curation of guests on a podcast such as  <em>Circulating Spaces</em> . As academic scholars with institutional funding, the very creation of  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  is fundamentally grounded in a North American system of institutional support, which, although fortuitous for us, is not accessible to anyone seeking to replicate such a project. As a result, we want to acknowledge our own roles in creating these networks, which are not neutral, but inflected by our own positions within the academy. Indeed, on a practical level, we observed how much easier it was to work with guests in a domestic context (and even easier when they were at our home institution) than with our international guests: the further the distance, the spottier the sound quality, the more difficult to schedule a time to speak or to guarantee the compatibility of computer equipment. The inertia of the metropole is strong. Our attempts to deconstruct the binary of academic versus its public by constructing a more nuanced network of relations were tempered by this gravitational pull toward the University of Virginia’s resources, including, most importantly, its human resources. We hope, however, that beginning to make connections between far-flung guests within our own localized networks here will enable future audiences to make similar connections and expand the network out beyond our hub at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>In  <em>Teaching Community</em> , bell hooks writes,  “One of the dangers we face in our educational systems is the loss&hellip; of a feeling of connection and closeness with the world beyond the academy”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  models a more open, collaborative model for the humanities through the practice of the Digital Humanities, the theories of world literature, and the spirit of public humanities. We have seen how the affordances of the podcast have shaped our conversations — and by extension, our research — while also enabling us to theorize and practice more nuanced relationships between what is academic and what is public. We reconnect with the world beyond the academy even as we show that this world is not, in fact, separate from the academy. These connections are increasingly important for the future of humanistic studies. While  <em>Circulating Spaces</em>  itself provides a modest, two-season long run of conversations between academics, teachers, librarians, artists, and more, as we have hoped to demonstrate in this essay, it suggests the potential for much broader and robust work with the podcast as a form of research that participates in the creation of these feelings of connectivity and closeness.</p>

For the principle investigators of  <em>Circulating Spaces</em> , this event highlighted the pressing need to think through radical division all the more strenuously, and to theorize more nuanced networks of affinity and difference based on a more complex understanding of public.&#160;<a href="#fnref:9" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This typically conservative view of the role of the humanities is not new, and as referenced in the discussion on the origin of public humanities, was a critique to which the public humanities sought to respond by demonstrating the wide applicability of humanities-based research. Organizations like Humanities in Action, a branch of the National Humanities Center, continue to make the case for the importance of the humanities by highlighting how humanities research and teaching provide valuable perspectives on topics of public concern. See, <a href="https://action.nationalhumanitiescenter.org/what-are-humanities/">https://action.nationalhumanitiescenter.org/what-are-humanities/</a>. With that in mind, efforts are underway to develop more open-source platforms. The Manifold Scholarship platform, for example, jointly developed by the University of Minnesota Press, the GC Digital Scholarship Lab at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and Cast Iron Coding (Portland, OR), is a particularly promising open-source platform that offers a framework of academic publishing that is focused on community engagement while encouraging discussion between readers.&#160;<a href="#fnref:28" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare’s works and their relation to the language and texts of his culture are hardly new arrivals in online digital scholarship or a new focus in the development of digital methodologies and tools; indeed, the editors of  <em>Shakespeare’s Language in Digital Media</em>  argue that  “the state of computing in Shakespeare studies”  functions as  “a benchmark of our scholarly digital literacy in general: now, as ever, Shakespeare is the test bed for our latest remediation technologies”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. As a case in point, the editors relate that twenty years ago, in 1997-8, a sort of precursor to their collection appeared in the form of a pair of special issues of  <em>Early Modern Literary Studies</em> . The essays there focused on two new/nascent digital scholarly resources: the  <em>Early Modern English Dictionaries Database</em>  ( <em>EMEDD</em> ), under the editorship of Ian Lancashire, and  <em>Internet Shakespeare Editions</em>  (ISE), under the editorship of Michael Best. Today,  <em>EMEDD</em>  has been superseded by  <em>Lexicons of Early Modern English</em>  ( <em>LEME</em> ), edited by Lancashire, and  <em>ISE</em>  (now under the editorship of Janelle Jenstad) has been joined by sibling projects like  <em>Queen’s Men Editions</em>  ( <em>QME</em> ),  <em>Digital Renaissance Editions</em>  ( <em>DRE</em> ) and the  <em>Map of Early Modern London</em>  ( <em>MoEML</em> ). While the essays in the present collection bring together text editing and historical linguistic analysis in digital scholarship, the editors point out that a divergence persists between these two fields that is mirrored in the differing directions that  <em>LEME</em>  and  <em>ISE</em>  have taken towards their texts: the former along a dynamic text path facilitating lexical research across a corpus of period glossaries, the latter along a hypertextual edition path facilitating enhanced reading and study of individual Shakespeare plays. The editors point to signs of convergence of these divergent paths, and one of the sources of interest in this collection for the digital humanist (Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean) is the ways the essays suggest how – in the digital humanities test bed that is digital Shakespeare – such diverging scholarly activities and foci (the word and the text, the micro and the macro) might be integrated in or across future digital scholarly environments.</p>
<p>On the whole, the essays in this collection focus on Shakespeare’s (or Shakespeare-adjacent) plays and how they can be newly understood and newly edited with primary resources such as  <em>LEME</em> ,  <em>Early English Books Online</em>  ( <em>EEBO</em> ), digital editing/publishing platforms like  <em>ISE</em>  and  <em>QME</em> , and some common digital tools like  <em>Voyant Tools</em> , Python scripts, and spreadsheet software. In addition, Laura Estill and Andie Silva’s essay  “Storing and Accessing Knowledge: Digital Tools for the Study of Early Modern Drama”  provides a critical if somewhat cursory survey of some other key online resources that are currently available to scholars of early modern drama: the  <em>English Short Title Catalogue</em>  ( <em>ESTC</em> ), the  <em>Database of Early English Plays</em>  ( <em>DEEP</em> ),  <em>Early Modern London Theatres</em>  ( <em>EMLoT</em> ),  <em>Patrons and Performances</em> , and the  <em>World Shakespeare Bibliography</em>  ( <em>WSB</em> ).</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s language/word usage is the focus of the essays of Part I, “Old words through new media: Re-reading Shakespeare with  <em>EEBO-TCP</em>  and  <em>LEME</em> .” As the editors point out in their prefatory marks to this section,  <em>LEME</em>  and  <em>EEBO-TCP</em>  (and their interlinking) now compel editors of early modern play texts to rethink how they gloss words, given that they can now not only explain words that contemporary readers might find obscure, but also identify words that Shakespeare’s contemporaries would have found unfamiliar, and which therefore prompt closer examination of the speeches and scenes in which these unfamiliar (or “hard”) words are present.</p>
<p>The first essay here, Valerie Wayne’s  “Beyond the  <em>OED</em>  Loop: Digital Resources and the Arden 3  <em>Cymbeline</em> ,”  begins by pointing out the reliance of editors of Shakespeare on the  <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>  ( <em>OED</em> ) in determining the uniqueness of Shakespeare’s deployment and development of English vocabulary and word usage, and the reliance of the  <em>OED</em>  on Shakespeare (and his editors) as a source for new usages of words and new coinages — the so-called  “ <em>OED</em>  Loop.”  One way around this loop is the  <em>Early English Books Online-Text Creation Partnership</em>  ( <em>EEBO-TCP</em> ), comprising (as of July 2016), 60,331 texts coded for searching, which Wayne uses in conjunction with  <em>LEME</em>  and the  <em>OED</em>  to  “assist in the recovery of words once thought to be errors in early texts, correct claims for coinages, clarify occluded meanings, and detect the most prevalent forms and spellings”   <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. (As the following essay by Lancashire and Tersigni notes, as of 2018,  <em>LEME</em>  comprised about  “665,000 word-entries in 199 lexical works from about 1475 to 1702,”  with  <em>LEME</em>  and the  <em>OED</em>    “overlap[ping] by less than 5% in the quotations they offer”   <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>). Wayne proceeds to demonstrate how such documentary editing is done using specific examples from  <em>Cymbeline</em> , in the process — even if only provisionally, given the material still forthcoming on these resources — revealing doubtful editorial emendations, clarifying cruxes in the interpretation of phrases, calling into question Shakespeare as the coiner of certain words and word usages, recovering often downplayed or not fully appreciated sexual meanings, and determining the usual spelling of a proper name (it’s  <em>Innogen</em> , not  <em>Imogen</em> ). As Wayne points out:  “Both databases enable forms of recovery and argument that were barely possible a decade or two ago and are of immense help to an editor”   <sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> who wants to do a historically sensitive analysis of Shakespeare’s use of language.</p>
<p>Ian Lancashire and Elisa Tersigni’s  “Shakespeare’s Hard Words, and Our Hard Senses,”  like Wayne’s essay, shows how  <em>LEME</em>  can provide more historically accurate and more coherent glosses on Shakespeare words. Noting that  “no editors have yet annotated Shakespeare’s works for the relative difficulty of their words to his contemporaries”   <sup id="fnref4:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, they use  <em>LEME</em>  to explore how Shakespeare’s contemporary audiences understood his language and how that affected the perception of his characters, focusing on  <em>Richard III</em>  and  <em>The Tempest</em> . They note a marked difference in what words contemporary editors gloss and what words were considered  “hard”  by those who created glossaries in the early modern period, and compare the differing deployment of hard words in the speeches of Richmond and Richard to their troops before the Battle of Bosworth, which, they argue, Shakespeare employed innovatively to  “illuminate his characters”   <sup id="fnref5:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Using the  <em>Hard Word Annotator</em> , a  <em>LEME</em>  tool that accepts plaintext versions of modern-spelling Early Modern texts and identifies the hard words in them, they analyze the entirety of  <em>The Tempest</em>    “to test whether hard words are used consistently as part of the characterization,”  concluding that the  “percentage of hard words used by characters reflects their personality, occupation, race, gender, and social status”   <sup id="fnref6:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The bookish Prospero, perhaps unsurprisingly, emerges as the leader in the use of hard words, which Lancashire and Tersigni cleverly suggest explains Prospero’s repeated interruption of his recounting of his past life in Act 1, Scene 2: to confirm that Miranda (and the audience) are still paying attention to a speech peppered with baffling words. Their analysis also supports the decision by some editors to reassign to Prospero a speech (also in Act 1, Scene 2) assigned to Miranda in the First Folio, given that the frequency of hard words is more in character with Prospero’s vocabulary than his daughter’s.</p>
<p>The remaining two essays of Part I, Daniel Aureliano Newman’s  “Terms of Art in Law and Herbals,”  and Elizabeth Bernath’s  “‘Strangers enfranchised’: Shakespeare’s  <em>Hamlet</em>  and the Mother Tongue,”  use  <em>LEME</em>  and  <em>EEBO</em>  in conjunction to explore, in the former, the use of herbal and legal  “terms of art”  (or what we would call jargon) in  <em>Hamlet</em> ,  <em>King John</em> , and  <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>  (with a particularly compelling contribution to, if not resolution of, the vexed issue of Perdita’s  “streak’d Gilly-vors” ), and, in the latter, a comparison of hard words in  <em>Hamlet</em>  against the diachronic evidence of the  “enfranchisement”  of hard words in the English  “mother tongue.”  As with Lancashire and Tersigni’s analysis of Richmond’s speech in  <em>Richard III</em> , Bernath argues that, in Hamlet’s soliloquies, Shakespeare provides glosses, often synonyms, for (still) hard words within the speeches themselves.</p>
<p>The essays of Part I together offer a compelling case for the important insights that can result from textual databases whose encoding, data structures, and search tools can enable sophisticated and wide-ranging linguistic research queries. The remaining four essays (besides the Estill and Silva essay previously mentioned) broaden the scope beyond words and language, shifting, in effect, from a ‘ <em>LEME</em>  orientation’ to an ‘ <em>ISE</em>  orientation.’ Andrew Griffin’s  “Text, Performance, and Multidisciplinarity: On a Digital Edition of  <em>King Leir</em> ,”  describes how the capaciousness of digital editions enables the  <em>Queen’s Men Editions</em>  (QME) to avoid the prescriptivism that invariably manifests in print versions of performance editions, given their limited ability to incorporate a full range of production examples. Instead of a transhistorical or ahistorical or ideal conceptualization of a performance of a play, the  <em>QME</em>  of  <em>King Leir</em> , by collaborating with a team who staged a production of the play, can link to its specific production details (in the form of images and videos) within the context of production notes that detail possible performance options considered, discussion about these options, and what option was eventually chosen (and why). Toby Malone’s  “A Digital Parallel-Text Approach to Performance Historiography”  describes a prototype parallel-text digital edition (created using spreadsheet software) enabling comparative analysis of the Quarto 1 and Folio versions of  <em>Richard III</em> , along with 10 historical promptbooks and performance editions ranging from the 18th to 20th centuries relating to historically significant Shakespearean actors such as Colly Cibber, David Garrick, John Philip Kemble, Edmund Kean, William Charles Macready, and Henry Irving. Malone argues that  “[o]ne simple and ubiquitous digital tool — a spreadsheet — makes the systematic, large-scale, and flexible comparative close reading of performance texts possible ”   <sup id="fnref7:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> in ways that print parallel texts cannot. While some digital humanities scholars might scoff at the use of a general-use spreadsheet program for a (prototype) digital edition, such a tool has the advantage of realizing and ensuring some degree of longevity to an digital edition than one created through a digital humanities-specific comparison and collation tool like the now-defunct  <em>Juxta Commons</em> , a web service that was until recently offered by  <em>NINE</em> S ( <em>Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship</em> ), developed at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>Michael Ullyot and Adam James Bradley’s  “Past Texts, Present Tools, and Future Critics: Toward  <em>Rhetorical Schematics</em> ,”  can be regarded as occupying a transitory place between a focus on word analysis and a focus on textual editing, given its focus on rhetorical figures. In the essay, the authors discuss their creation of a Python script designed to process plaintext corpora like Martin Mueller’s  <em>Shakespeare His Contemporaries</em>  (comprising Shakespeare’s plays along with most of the plays written within a generation before and after his active career as a playwright) to find a rhetorical scheme called  <strong>gradatio</strong> , which is a series of  <strong>anadiploses</strong> . The essay cites an example of  <strong>gradatio</strong>  from  <em>As You Like It</em>  (Act 5, Scene 2): “For your brother and my sister not sooner met but they  <strong>looked</strong> ; no sooner  <strong>looked</strong>  but they  <strong>loved</strong> ; no sooner  <strong>loved</strong>  but they  <strong>sighed</strong> ; no sooner  <strong>sighed</strong>  but they asked one another the  <strong>reason</strong> ; not sooner knew the  <strong>reason</strong>  but they sought the remedy; and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage.” While the Python script itself is not included, a fairly clear description of it is: its goal was “to break text files into sentences, to tokenize their words and lemmatize their tokens, to insert clause breaks based on punctuation, and finally to use Regular Expressions to look for matching lemmas…within four words of the clause breaks” <sup id="fnref8:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The script identified 114 instances of what it was told was  <strong>gradatio</strong>  in 400 plays for analysis and evaluation, leading the researchers to contemplate not only the efficacy of the script, but their critical understanding of  <strong>graditio</strong>  itself. The authors concede that there might be instances of  <strong>gradatio</strong>  this script did not identify but argue that their modest purpose was to obtain  “more complete results than we could gather without the algorithm.”  They also concede that such scripts appear to only be effective at identifying rhetorical schemes  “of direct repetition and variation”   <sup id="fnref9:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of words or phrases, and so cannot be used to locate a broad spectrum of rhetorical figures in digital texts corpora.</p>
<p>In envisioning practical future solutions for  “a more nuanced, multivalent, tool-enhanced criticism”  that would extend their script and integrate the textual edition and the database (or, in other words,  <em>ISE</em>  and  <em>LEME</em> ), Ullyot and Bradley they propose  “an unobtrusive plug-in for  <em>ISE</em>  that makes [its editions] interoperable with databases”  and that  “preserve[s] close reading while promoting distant reading, balancing our attention to local phenomena with our ambient awareness of comparable phenomena”   <sup id="fnref10:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. They argue that such interoperability requires that textual corpora have APIs, as  <em>Folger Digital Texts</em>  does:  “An API for the  <em>ISE</em>  would allow its texts to offer limitless new questions, which these interoperable databases can illuminate”   <sup id="fnref11:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The idea of limitlessness that the interoperability of digital resources promises is clearly in evidence in Diane K. Jakacki’s  “ <em>Internet Shakespeare Editions</em>  and the Infinite (Editorial) Others: Supporting Critical Tagsets for Linked Editions,”  which also takes up the topic of integration/interoperability, albeit in a less speculative and more grounded (and consequently wary) fashion. As the editor of the  <em>ISE</em> ’s edition of  <em>Henry VIII</em> , as well as the Technical Editor of  <em>ISE</em> , Jakacki is alert to both the possibilities and the pitfalls of interoperable, networked digital editions. The key challenge the essay addresses is  “to what degree we should engage in acts of editorial disruption that allow us to move forward towards infinity [the infinity represented by other potential editions] while maintaining editorial stability across digital projects”   <sup id="fnref12:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. As she considers her  <em>Henry VIII</em>  edition beyond the additional TEI encoding she has used and that she demonstrates can be valuable for aiding an editor’s critical interpretation, and starts to consider it as part of a network that ties it in with digital resources like  <em>MoEML</em>  and  <em>DRE</em> , a digital edition of a single play starts to stretch out towards an unfinishable infinity: Jakacki makes reference to how a non-peer reviewed edition of Samuel Rowley’s  <em>When You See Me You Know Me</em>  that she intended to include in her edition of  <em>Henry VIII</em>  (presumably as an appendix) was, with the launch of  <em>DRE</em> , re-envisioned as a peer-reviewed edition of Rowley’s play for  <em>DRE</em>  that would serve as a companion edition to her  <em>ISE</em>  of  <em>Henry VIII</em> . She also mentions the idea of creating a shared Personography of all the characters that appear across  <em>ISE</em> ,  <em>QME</em> , and  <em>DRE</em> . The challenge Jakacki points out, with legitimate concern, is that considering the creation of an edition in light of how it can be interoperable with other digital resources can significantly add to an editor’s task and timelines to completion. Indeed, such work can potentially take an editor far from their initial interest: the text(s) of a Shakespeare play. Can editing ever be said to &rsquo;end&rsquo; in an interoperable digital environment?</p>
<p>There is much more to the essays in this collection that I have not foregrounded and that would be of value to scholars primarily interested in historical linguistic analysis, Shakespeare studies and scholarly editing. While readers primarily interested in the technical side of digital humanities may find the essays less than forthcoming (Ullyot and Bradley, for example, do not provide the actual Python script they created, and so one cannot judge whether it could be modified or extended to detect similar or other textual structures) and vague on future directions and modes of development, especially regarding cyberinfrastructures for interoperability, there is solid content and provocative ideas in this collection about the possible paths (or perhaps path?) to making Shakespeare’s texts digitally accessible in all their complexity as well as early modern English texts and culture more broadly. If the editors’ claim that Shakespeare is the test bed for new developments in digital humanities is true, we should continue to look to the digital remediation of the author’s old texts for inspiring new digital tools.</p>

<p>Editions, in print or digital, have a prominent place in humanities research as they make primary sources accessible and are the foundation for scholarly argumentation in many disciplines. Allowing the unambiguous citation of an edited text is an important task of a scholarly edition since it makes research processes retraceable and transparent. This has not changed in the digital age, however, despite the digital medium posing new challenges for editors and users of scholarly digital editions (SDE) alike.</p>
<p>The Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing (IDE) has developed a checklist to evaluate scholarly digital editions. Two items of this catalogue deal with the assessment of the citability of such editions:<br>
1.2. Bibliographic identification of the reviewed SDE. An SDE should be identified in terms similar to traditional bibliographic descriptions: a title, the responsible editors, other responsible persons and institutions, the dates of its publication (initial, versions, last modification), and the address (in terms of web-URL or other naming conventions like DOI, URN or PURL) should all be evident. Any difficulties extracting such information from the SDE should be remarked upon in the review. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  4.8. Identification and citation. Are there persistent identifiers for the objects of the SDE? Which level of the content structure do they address? Which resolving mechanisms and naming systems are used? Does the SDE supply citation guidelines? <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The first quote from the catalogue is concerned with the possibility to extract suitable bibliographic data to cite an SDE correctly. It is important that the SDE should be identifiable in the same manner as traditional print publications. However, besides traditional bibliographic data such as the title, editor(s) and date of publication, the version or the date the digital object was last changed is also indicated and the Internet address is important for citation too. Two other crucial aspects of digital editions are mentioned in the second quote: does the SDE use persistent identifiers and does it provide citation guidelines for users? Print editing knew similar concepts: updated versions of a book are published as second, third and further subsequent editions, the ISBN is recognised as a persistent identifier and the title page as the location where all the bibliographic information can be found. When looking at digital editing however, updating an edition, providing persistent identifiers and bibliographic data for citation are not handled in a similar manner and pose new challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent names.</strong>  URLs are globally unique identifiers that could be used for persistent addressing of online resources <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. However, as a URL’s primary function is to locate resources, they do not guarantee that the information they present to stays the same over time or that the entire web page they point to will still be available in two, five, or ten years. The unreliability of URLs for citation is well known and causes problems for research in different disciplines <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Permalink and Persistent Identifier (PID) strategies have been developed to ensure resources can be cited using names that are globally unique and stable over time <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. However, it must be emphasised that the stability of permalinks and PIDs is primarily an organisational challenge as the assigning institution must put policies in place for assignment, management, and maintenance of identifiers and ensure correct resolving <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Consequently, persistence of online resources cannot be guaranteed without commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Versioning.</strong>  Closely linked to stable addresses is the question of how to deal with changes of digital objects over time. A content provider may change the content of a website at any time and without any explicit indication of the changes <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. From a scholarly citation perspective, this causes several issues, the foremost of these is to the user who needs to cite a specific version of the webpage content as she consulted it. For instance, this is particularly true for users of legal texts the citations of which must refer to a determined version. This is also a relevant issue for scholarly publishing and the recent publication by Broyles has highlighted the relevance of this topic for the digital editing community <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Critical editions are the basis of textual scholarship and constantly changing texts cannot be reliably cited. Wikipedia is an example of a website with constantly changing content, with every editing of an article resulting in a new version with a permalink. Wikipedia deals with this issue in the following way: The most recent authorized revision of an article can be accessed via a canonical URL that always points to the most recent, accepted version of an article. However, older versions can still be accessed using their permalink which is also strongly recommended by Wikipedia itself.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  When a user accesses an older version, a warning message appears indicating that newer versions of this article are available.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  In TEI editions, changes and revisions can be documented using the  <code>&lt;revisionDesc&gt;</code>  in the header section of the TEI document by providing a list of changes made to a document.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  The benefit of this approach is that the editor(s) may provide a descriptive summary of changes, which provide additional information about the people involved, the parts of the documents that were effected, etc. and this can be as detailed as the editor(s) require it to be. However, a disadvantage is that it is very impractical to record all changes to a file in the TEI document and consequently older versions cannot be recovered using the TEI method alone.</p>
<p><strong>Granular citation.</strong>  A citation should be as precise as possible to make it easier for a reader to address and verify the source. In academic papers and scholarly discussion, it is necessary to cite not only entire works but to be precise sub-entities such as the page numbers of a book or verse and the number of a poem. In the humanities, established granular citation methods are used to cite chapters, paragraphs, pages and lines of a print publication or manuscript. A frequently used example for canonical numbers is that of the books, chapters, and verses of the Bible. These entities can be used to cite passages of the Bible across different editions and translations which ensures, for instance, that John 3:16 ( “For God so loved the world, that he gave&hellip;” ) can be found in any Bible version or translation under the same number.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  One must distinguish between semantic numbers, which are content related (e.g. chapters of a book), and visual numbers, which are object related (e.g. folios and lines of a manuscript) <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. This requirement has not changed for online resources; however, the implementation of granular citation options is very different in a digital editing context. From a technical perspective, granular referencing means referring to individual resources within a website, using an URI, or to a place within an electronic resource, either by addressing a position (e.g. byte position or pixel in an image) or the relevant markup structure. For a digital edition editor, it is important to evaluate what kind of granular citation strategy is required. It can be argued that traditional forms of citation of a source text, such as canonical numbers, can and should be considered and implemented in a new digital edition.</p>
<p><strong>Citation practice.</strong>  Several publications have pointed out that despite the availability of an increasing number of digital editions these are not being cited by the majority of students and researchers in the humanities who prefer to cite print publications instead <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Blaney and Siefring’s British History Online and Early English Books Online survey has shown that users are both concerned about the stability of digital resources and that they do not know how to cite digital resources correctly. They suggest that creators of web content can contribute to facilitate the citation of digital resources by providing recommendations on how to cite a resource and by implementing a solid permalink strategy <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. The relevance of the topic is also highlighted by an article about a recent survey on the use researchers make of digital editions and their expectations. The authors report that participants indicated that the provision of suitable citation information is still a neglected issue <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Consequently, clarity about how and what to cite in an SDE is vital information that should be communicated to a user.</p>
<p>The following study attempts to explore this topic further. In a survey conducted by the author of this study, the citation recommendations and permalink strategies of 670 digital editions, published between the 1990s and 2020, have been analysed. The primary goal of the survey was to collect data about how digital editions ensure citability of their content by:<br>
providing citation recommendations  ensuring the content can be cited with permalinks or PIDs   implementing a versioning strategy for its data</p>
<p>The quantitative analysis of the collected data will show developments that are, hopefully, not only representative for this sample, but applicable to the wider SDE community. In addition to the quantitative analysis, various citation strategies applied in different editing projects will be illustrated by taking a closer look at some of the editions in the list. The goal is to identify developments/strategies that are frequently used and which also appear to have proven value as effective solutions.</p>
<p>The full list of editions and data on which the analysis, charts and conclusions are based is provided in a Github repository. All charts published in this paper were produced by the author himself and are based on the compiled dataset. The Github repository also contains the Jupyter notebook used to produce the graph visualisations.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="sampling-strategy-and-data-collection">Sampling strategy and data collection</h2>
<p>Patrick Sahle defines SDE as  “scholarly editions that are guided by a digital paradigm in their theory, method and practice”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Following his own definition, Sahle has compiled a catalogue of 670 editions over the last two decades.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  Sahle included several important properties of the catalogued editions and some of them, such as date, subject, language, and the category Edition source period, were used for analysis purposes in this research. Figure 1 shows the distribution of these categories across Sahle’s catalogue. However, at the time of writing this article, the catalogue included only occasional information about the availability of permalinks or citation information (for 85 editions). Therefore, all 670 editions had to be inspected to collect relevant data to assess their citability.</p>

<p>The study of a temporal development was desired as an original assumption of the author was that more recently developed editions show a greater awareness for issues of citation and more frequently use permalinks or PIDs for their resources. However, there are two main problems in trying to assign a date to a digital edition. First, some digital editions do not clearly state a date of publication. In print publishing it is standard to have a date of publication printed either on the title page or on its reverse side. Digital editions do not always provide an official publication date, some provide a period of time when the edition was under development, but already available as alpha or beta version, and a few digital editions do not publish any dates or include only vague information about their development. Second, digital editions may have changed over time (and indeed many did) and their interface and structure might have looked different ten or fifteen years ago. Consequently, a  “How to cite?”  page or a citation info pop-up may have been added more recently and may not have been present in an earlier release of the edition. To balance these issues and to facilitate a temporal comparison, the author divided the time between the 1990s (the period of development of the earliest edition in our data set) and 2020 into four periods: pre 2006, 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and 2016-2020. Each edition was assigned to one of these four periods depending on the publication date listed in Sahle’s catalogue. The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine was consulted for earlier editions (pre 2016) as it stores early snapshots of many editions. The URL of the snapshot that was consulted was recorded in the dataset for reference. By looking at an early snapshot it was often possible to see if a citation recommendation was already present earlier in the edition or if it was added later. For several editions no early snapshot was available, and I had to use a more recent snapshot or create a new one.</p>
<p>Each edition in Sahle’s catalogue was inspected and the presence of citation information was evaluated as follows. Data about three categories was collected:<br>
the presence of a citation recommendation with or without examples of how to cite the edition or parts of it  the presence of PIDs or permalinks  the presence of any version information (of individual objects or the entire edition)</p>
<p>What made the assessment slightly difficult, is that digital editions do not yet have an established structure. Consequently, the citation information could be found in different places. However, after looking through several editions, the author identified the most likely places to look for citation information:<br>
Some editions have bibliographic data or an example of how to cite the edition directly on the start page.  Some editions have their own citation page which can be accessed through a link in the top navigation.  Occasionally the footer includes bibliographic data, citation recommendation or a link to a page with citation information.  The  “About (this edition),”    “Project,”    “Copyrights and permissions”  pages sometimes contain a section explaining how to cite the edition and parts of it.  The impressum may contain citation information.  Some older editions provide an entry on how to cite the edition in the FAQ section.  Citation information could be available directly with the edited texts, facsimile images, etc.   And finally, it should be mentioned that some editions use a system of implicit citation by providing structural entities within an edition, but no explicit recommendation on how they should be used for citation and consequently they were also not counted as providing citation recommendations.</p>
<p>This variety of options highlights a core problem for users of SDEs. When moving from one SDE to another, one cannot be sure to find the citation information in the same place or implemented in a similar way. As the collected data for this study is based on the observation of the author, it might be possible that hard to find permalinks or citation recommendations were overlooked and are not included in the dataset. However, this does not impact on the results of the study as the goal was to explore the citability of editions. Citation information that is hard to find and uncertainty about the availability of permalinks, reduce the chance that an edition will be cited correctly and, therefore, can be considered as not present or not relevant.</p>
<p>The author looks at a Citation recommendation as a statement about how an edition or parts of it should be cited. Most editions that provide such information label it clearly. The dataset records not only the absence or the presence of such recommendations, it also includes a distinction between citation recommendations for the entire edition and recommendations for a more granular level of citation such as individual letters, individual webpages, images, chapters and paragraphs of a text. These categories are in concordance with the data collected in Sahle’s catalogue. Citation recommendations can have different levels of detail. Some may only suggest a permalink or an URL to be used, other editions include all necessary bibliographic data (editor, year of publication, etc.) for a citation and provide citation examples. Frequently, these citation examples follow a common citation style like MLA or APA. In addition to citation recommendations and the presence of examples, version information indicated by an SDE was also recorded. This information is very diverse and ranges from a simple version number for the entire edition (like an edition number in a book) to uniquely citable PIDs or permalink for all older versions of individual resources. The provision of a date of access is frequently found in citation recommendations. While the suggestion to include an access date in a citation shows awareness of the problem of changeability of an online resource, an access date is an indicator of an research process and does usually not correspond with an actual change to an online resource <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Consequently, the inclusion of an access date in a citation recommendation has not been counted as versioning strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, the provision of permalinks or PIDs was recorded. In the dataset either the name of the PID system (e.g. URN, DOI) is listed, or if an edition uses permalinks, or if neither was found. Another identifier which is usually used for print publications, the ISBN, is occasionally found in SDEs too, for instance in the  <em>Jane Austen’s Fiction Manuscripts’ edition</em>  or the  <em>Vespasiano da Bisticci, Lettere</em> . The use of ISBNs is particularly frequent in earlier editions as they were used, for example, for CD-ROM publications. Even if ISBNs are usually not listed among the PID systems, they are globally unique identifiers and I have recorded them in my dataset among PIDs and permalinks. One edition uses ISBN-A which is a DOI based on an ISBN.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  Some editions use unique and persistent project IDs. For instance, the  “How to cite”  page of the edition  <em>The Diplomatic Correspondence of Thomas Bodley, 1585-1597</em>  recommends that the persistent project IDs of each object should be included in any citation.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  This so-called Transcript ID will ensure that a resource can be found also in the future even if  “the website is restructured or the URL changes.”  Persistent project IDs do have their value for internal operations in an edition and can be used like canonical numbers to refer to a resource or parts of it. In the context of a specific domain or edition and combined with an URL (the editions URL) they become globally unique identifiers and therefore I have counted them as permalinks in the dataset.</p>
<h2 id="citation-recommendations-provided-by-digital-editions">Citation recommendations provided by digital editions</h2>
<p>The survey data shows a constant increase of editions that provide citation information for the edition or parts of it (see Figure 2). Interestingly, the number of editions that provide citation information for the entire edition has not increased much, from 25.3% (pre 2006) to 29.1% (2006-2010) to 19.7% (2011-2015), and 28.8% (2016-2020). However, the number of editions that provide granular citation options has increased nearly five times over the last 20 years. It seems that providing only a citation option for the entire edition was more common in the early times of digital editing, while in the past decade, editions increasingly provide recommendations for the citation of individual objects and also for sections within an edition. To sum up, more and more SDEs provide citation recommendations and especially editions that provide recommendations for granular citation have increased.</p>

<p>During this research, several strategies for the inclusion of bibliographic information and citation recommendations have been identified. The first strategy is a very traditional approach: a title page. A title page, like the ones found in printed books, is an established means to communicate essential bibliographic information required by common citation styles. The author’s initial assumption was that title pages might primarily be relevant in early SDEs that follow the printed book style and, therefore, recorded the presence of a title page only in the  “Comments”  column of the dataset. After having analysed the data, it seems that title pages feature more prominently in SDEs than originally expected and are present even in more recent editions (see Figure 4). However, it must be noted that a great number of editions with title pages were published series-like by the same organisations, for instance, the Herzog August Bibliothek (HAB), and the Éditions en ligne de l&rsquo;École des chartes (Élec), and Romantic Circles (RC). These organisations seem to have developed a template for SDEs which includes a title page. The presence of a title page does not exclude the use of other forms of citation recommendations in the same edition. On the contrary, the HAB uses a standardised citation statement and the Romantic Circles provides a citation page.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another strategy is to provide a brief statement that exemplifies how to cite the edition or parts of it. Such citation examples can look very diverse and may be found in different parts of the SDE. For instance, a citation recommendation for the entire website may be found on the home page, in the footer section, or on some subpage of the website – frequently on either the About, Copyright, Imprint, Permissions, or Project page (see Figure 5). The citation example may follow a common citation style; however, it is important that the necessary bibliographic data is provided to apply to the most common citation styles. Sometimes, however, only a permalink or PID is provided. While this is certainly enough to identify an online resource and link to it from other online publications, it does not provide enough information for citing using a traditional citation style.</p>

<p>In addition to a citation example for the entire SDE, granular citation examples for parts of an edition, for instance, individual web pages, edited objects, images, or even parts of texts, such as chapters and paragraphs, may be provided. These text- and object-related citation examples are in most cases displayed directly below, above, or next to a text or other object, for instance, as a text box, a cite button, or a link that produces a pop-up with the citation example in it. Citation information directly at the citable resource may, for instance, be found in the  <em>Jahrrechnungen der Stadt Basel 1535 bis 1610 – digital</em>  which provides a citation example for each transcription(see Figure 6), or the  <em>Edition Humboldt digital,</em>  and the edition  <em>Alfred Escher-Briefedition</em>  which provide citation statements for their letter transcriptions at the bottom of each page. The  <em>Welsche Gast digital</em>  displays an URN, DOI and a permalink prominently with its online resources and additionally a link that generates a detailed citation example (see Figure 7).</p>

<p>Some SDE citation examples are placed within a more elaborate citation statement or citation page. Citation statements or citation pages discuss the rule that should be applied when citing an edition or parts of it. This can be a brief statement in the  “About”  or  “User Guide”  section of the website, or an elaborate citation page. A good example of the first type can be found in the edition  <em>Wilhelmine von Bayreuth: Briefe über ihre Reise nach Frankreich und Italien 1754/1755</em> . The edition provides a  “Benutzerhinweis”  (user guide) page that contains a section explaining how the bibliographic information found on the home page (title page) and the URL should be used to cite the edition.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  The following section is then dedicated to the use of fragment identifiers to cite and address paragraphs within a text. The above mentioned edition  <em>The Diplomatic Correspondence of Thomas Bodley, 1585-1597</em>  has an  “Editorial”  section containing a link to a citation page. This page contains basic bibliographic data for citation and a brief description on how to cite the edition. Instead of giving an example, it is recommended that the user consults citation guidelines such as MLA for more information on how to cite electronic resources.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  An example of a different  “How to cite”  page can be found in the  <em>Samuel Beckett Digital Manuscript Project.</em>   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  The page is under the  “About”  section of the website and it contains a list of citation examples for the genetic editions provided by the project (see Figure 8).</p>

<p>Editions that provide citation pages often have a link in the main navigation page of the website or they include them in the footer. If citation pages are designed for a specific edition, they can become very detailed with instructions and/or examples that illustrate how to cite the edition and its different resources using popular citation styles. The  <em>Theodor Fontane: Notizbücher</em> <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> and the  <em>Willa Cather Archive</em>  are examples of such websites. The Fontane notebooks’ citation page lists examples for the citation of the entire edition, individual notebooks, and parts of the notebooks. For the Willa Cather Archive citation examples for letters, photographs, video clips, articles, audio recordings, speech transcripts, books, and parts of books. Furthermore, examples are provided in different citation styles (MLA, APA Style and Chicago/Turabian Style).<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Another type of citation page is used by some publishers that maintain several digital editions, such as Huygens ING and RC. In this case a generic citation page is used to communicate basic information on how to cite editions and resources produced by these publishers. The benefit is that this approach is much easier to maintain than to maintain a citation page for each edition. It is also a sustainable means to provide citation information as long as the page is not moved. For instance, RC editions have the link to the citation page in the footer either under  “Electronic Citation,”  or under  “About Romantic Circles”  and the citation page was already in place in 2005.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup></p>
<p>An additional way that shows how a SDE may provide guidance for referencing is by embedding metadata that can be used by reference management tools such as Zotero, Citavi or Endnote. For instance, by using an embedded metadata strategy, standardised metadata (e.g. Dublin Core) can be included in the head section of the HTML document via so-called meta-tags. A better strategy is to include bibliographic metadata as COinS (ContextObjects in Spans) in the HTML page. COinS is a citation microformat based on the OpenURL standard which allows the inclusion of metadata in URLs. As the name COinS suggests, bibliographic metadata is included in an empty  <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>  Element directly in the HTML page <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. This strategy is successfully used in online catalogue platforms such as WorldCat. While the use of COinS and similar strategies is still the exception in SDEs, the provision of an edition’s bibliographic metadata in a machine-readable way for reference management tools will become increasingly important in the future <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="granular-referencing-strategies">Granular referencing strategies</h2>
<p>The survey had a very wide understanding of granular addressing strategies: if editions provide recommendations on how to cite anything beyond the edition as a whole, it has been considered as granular addressing. The collected data shows that before 2010 only few editions provided the option for granular citation, while in the last 10 years editions are increasingly providing recommendation on how to cite their individual parts (see Figure 2 and 3). However, occasionally SDEs go even further and provide addresses for smaller citable entities. The addressing markup strategy for addressing parts of an XML or HTML document using an URI and a fragment identifier or standards such as XPath and XPointer <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> is most frequently used by content providers to create citable entities within texts in scholarly digital editions and we will look at different examples such as CTS further below. However, it has to be pointed out that the other strategies for granular referencing are also used; an example would be the addressing of regions within an image using the Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  This strategy is still not widely present in SDEs, but holds great potential for future research with images in editions.</p>

<p>Citable entities in SDEs are usually HTML fragments that have an attribute id and can be addressed using a fragment identifier attached to a URL. The publication platform of the Max Weber Stiftung Perspectivia.net provides a detailed citation recommendation for its editions including a section on how to cite granular entities such as paragraphs using fragment identifier (see Figure 9). The traditional workflow is to generate the fragment identifier during the transformation process from TEI to HTML. The  <em>Text Encoding for Interchange</em>  (TEI) standard has become the main standard used for digital scholarly editing projects worldwide. The traditional workflow in TEI editions is that edited texts are semantically marked up and stored in a TEI document for long-term preservation and exchange, but the primary access point for a user is an HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based user interface generated using XSLT, XQuery or other technologies that translate between data (storage) and publication. From the perspective of citability it is important to note that the structure of the TEI document and the HTML web presentation can be fundamentally different. In fact, during the transformation process from TEI to HTML, content may be removed, added, or reorganised <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. Text, metadata, markup and fragment identifiers in the TEI document are not necessarily the same as in the HTML document. Consequently, citing the text from the TEI document or the presentation of the text by the edition’s user interface are two different things. For the sake of citability both should be possible. However, as TEI is the format for long-term preservation of data; it could be argued that ideally a citation should point to identifiers in the TEI source file. Furthermore, the mapping between TEI and HTML structures and identifiers for citation needs to be clearly documented and communicated. This can be done using the element references declaration ( <code>&lt;refsDecl&gt;</code> ) in the TEI header. However, documentation should also be present on the website of the edition. Lastly, another option to reduce divergence between the TEI and the user interface would be to create a user interface that reproduces the TEI source document (or parts of it) in HTML. This is, for instance, realised by the CETEIcean project <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>
<p>In a digital editing context attempts have also been made to use semantically structured PIDs for granular addressing of sections of a text. One such attempt is the protocol Canonical Text Services (CTS) which was originally developed for the referencing of ancient texts. Ancient texts, such as Homer’s hymns, often have established canonical numbers that were used for citation for decades or even centuries <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. CTS provides a means to translate these citations into digital form and makes them human and machine-readable <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. The CTS understands a text as a number of hierarchically structured entities that can each be addressed by established canonical citation rules. To identify these entities URNs are used to follow a syntax containing canonical names and numbers. Undoubtedly, this is an elegant and practical solution to create abstract and human-readable persistent identifiers for texts. However, as Kalvesmaki already pointed out, a fundamental problem is that the cts namespace is not registered with the global namespace authority IANA <sup id="fnref2:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> and, therefore, anybody could register and use the namespace for other purposes. Consequently, Perseus<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  and other projects must be aware that their URNs are currently not sustainable in the long run. Perseus itself translates its URNs into URLs. The provision of permalinks based on the URN syntax would be a suitable workaround until the URN namespace issue is resolved.</p>
<p>A project that has a similar strategy is  <em>The Classical Latin Texts</em>  online collection by  <em>The Packard Humanities Institute</em>  (PHI). This project makes numerous classical texts available and citable using canonical numbers in their human-readable URLs that follow a similar logic as the CTS URNs.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  Other projects also implemented solutions to represent traditional canonical citations as digital citations. The following are only a sample of projects that succeeded in this process. The  <em>dMGH</em>  project makes the monumental edition series  <em>Monumenta Germaniae Historica</em>  (MGH) available in digital form. The project uses human-readable permalinks containing the known abbreviations for volumes of the MGH and individual page numbers can be included in the URL for citation. This is an interesting example for the use of object-related visual numbers for citation.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  The final example is Peter Robinson’s suggested solution to the citation of electronic texts which is also based on URNs. He calls it the  “documents, entities and texts”  (DET) scheme and demonstrates the applicability of the system through an implementation into the Textual Communities environment using the Canterbury Tales as an example <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Two final points concerning granular citation need to be discussed in brief. The first is the bibliographic data for the paratextual pages of an SDE that is frequently missing. Some editions provide recommendations on how to cite the edition or parts of it, but it is sometimes not clear how to cite the introductions, commentaries, bibliographies, technical documentation, the documentation of the encoding model etc. These are fundamental resources of an edition and it should be possible for a user to cite them correctly. The second point is important in digital editing projects that were produced in teams. The TEI  <code>&lt;respStmt&gt;</code>  (statement of responsibility) allows recording of the individuals responsible for the editing of a TEI document and also their roles. Frequently, the main editor(s) only are mentioned in a citation statement. Many people apart from the editor(s), however, are often involved in compiling the transcriptions or collations, while xml developer(s) are responsible for the data modelling and web developer(s) are responsible for the correct presentation of the edited text on the edition’s website. The question arises whose name should appear besides that of the main editor(s) in a citation statement? When individual resources, such as a transcription, are cited, at least the person(s) who did the main editorial work should have a prominent place in the citation statement. Similarly, the xml and web developer should be cited when referring to the data model (as ODD or a prose documentation) or the source code of the website. To list every project member in a citation is not practical as this will always result in an et al mention and the essential information about responsibilities gets lost.</p>
<h2 id="pids-and-permalinks-in-digital-scholarly-editions">PIDs and permalinks in digital scholarly editions</h2>
<p>PIDs and permalinks are central for citation of SDEs as they are persistent names for web content and consequently imperative for reference texts that are used for citation by the scientific community. However, the survey results are slightly disillusioning (see Figure 10). It is a positive development that the use of permalinks and PIDs has increased in the last two decades. Yet over 75% of SDEs still do not provide PIDs or permalinks – or at least do not communicate this information to their users.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While URNs and DOIs are well known PIDs and their use is already a sign to the informed user that these identifiers can be used for citation, URLs have a bad reputation for being unreliable and have to be explicitly labelled as being permalinks. Some editions might use their URLs as permalinks, but do not explicitly state this, or if they do the statement is difficult to find. As mentioned in the introduction, the maintenance of PIDs and permalinks is key to their function as persistent names for online resources. Ideally, an institution with suitable infrastructure and a commitment to preserve and maintain its online resources should oversee the hosting of a SDE. The same is valid for the management and maintenance of PIDs and permalinks. Long-term preservation and the permalink strategy are important information for a user as they may increase trust in the stability of an online resource. Therefore, such a statement should be placed in a prominent position.</p>
<p>The HAB provides persistent URLs (permalinks) for its online resources and has a brief, but clear commitment published on its website that ensures the persistent availability of its online content via the persistent URLs.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  The  <em>edition humboldt digital</em> , developed and maintained by BBAW, is another good example of the use of permalinks in SDEs. The edition includes a permalink statement that specifies what permalinks in the edition are and a commitment by the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW), which is committed to making published resources available.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  The statement is brief, but it also mentions that the persistent availability of versions will be ensured via the indicated permalinks. This is a functionality that is unfortunately rarely seen in SDEs. The edition  <em>Welscher Gast digital</em>  is an interesting case in this context, since for some of its resources the edition provides a DOI and a Zitierlink (citation link), a permalink, and for other resources an additional URN. A user may ask, should all these options be used for citation or only the Zitierlink? A clear answer comes from the developers of the edition who solved this issue elegantly by providing information about the stability of the permalink in an info lightbox and additionally a Zitierhinweis (citation recommendation with an example) indicating that the DOI should be used for citation (see Figure 7).</p>
<p>Closely related to the use of permalinks and PIDs is the question of long-term availability of online resources. Sahle’s catalogue includes several editions that were available 10 or 20 years ago, but are gone today or have been moved and their original URL is no longer functional.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  Various reasons may explain why an edition cannot be found at the present time or why it was taken down. In any case, finding out that links are not working can be very frustrating experience for readers. One cannot be sure whether the editon no longer exists or if it has simply been moved to a different location and no redirect was set up. If an edition is withdrawn fully from the web, a good solution is to set up a tombstone page,<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  a special type of landing page, at the original URL providing at least basic information about the whereabouts of the edition. The Shakespeare Quartos Archive was taken down recently, on 15. April 2020,  “as the technologies which it is built with have reached end-of-life.”  The Bodleian Libraries set up a tombstone page, but call it a  “holding page,”  at the original URL of the SDE (see Figure 11) with basic bibliographic information with a screenshot of the edition, a brief description of the project, a brief statement why it is not available anymore and when it was taken down, and a link to a 2019 version of it preserved in the Wayback Machine.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  Even if it is regrettable that the edition could not be maintained, the provision of the tombstone page and the link to an archived version is an excellent service. Ideally one would also expect to have a download option for the editions data. Even if the interface and functionalities are no longer functional, the TEI data is still a valuable resource for research that can be used independently from the outdated software for the edition.</p>

<h2 id="versioning-strategies-in-sdes">Versioning strategies in SDEs</h2>
<p>As pointed out in the introduction, a versioning strategy is important for SDEs as their content can be changed as easily as the content of any other website. Following strategies from software design, digital editions are also frequently released at an early stage of development and resources are revised or added at a later stage. Therefore, resources in digital editions might change over time and it is important to make those changes transparent to a user. For scholarly discourse, editions need to provide resources that can be reliably cited not when they are finished, but as soon as they are released to the public. For citation and later retrieval, it is imperative that users know what version they are dealing with. Different strategies are used to indicate versions.</p>
<p>The results of the study have shown that over the past decade editions with a versioning strategy have substantially increased (see Figure 12). Unfortunately, however, most SDEs still do not have a versioning strategy implemented. The reasons for this cannot be of a technical nature alone, as the provision of version information in its most basic form only requires adding a version number or a version date. Deeper reasons are to be found for the problem rather in the way editors perceive their online editions. These are often considered as being final and static, scarcely affected by the changes that may occur once they have been released. Additionally, editors may believe that minor changes applied to online editions do not matter to the user. If this is the case, however, this perspective needs to be openly communicated on an edition’s website. Another possible explanation for the lack of a solid versioning strategy, might be that there is still too little awareness of both the topic itself and the importance of transparency and retractability for changes in a digital editing context. Scholarly arguments and citations cannot be based on texts that may be modified overnight. The following examples have been selected for briefly highlighting the different strategies used by editions listed in Sahle’s catalogue to indicate for users what version they are dealing with. The already mentioned study by Broyles analyses the versioning strategies of about 30 digital editions <sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. While this study is primarily concerned with strategies to indicate versions to the user as part of a citation recommendation, Broyles study also explored logged changes in data files and other forms of content versioning.</p>

<p>Examples of early editions with a versioning strategy and declaration are  <em>The Electronic Beowulf</em> ,<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>    <em>The Auchinleck Manuscript</em>   <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  and  <em>The Old Bailey Proceedings Online</em> . <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  In these cases, the editions have a version number and not individual web resources. This is the same approach used in traditional print editing: the author or editor of a book or an edition decides when the release of a revised version is necessary. Citation recommendations provided by these editions suggest adding the current version number or the date to any citation. Previous versions may be available in an archive, but neither of the three editions provide permalinks for older versions.  <em>The Online Froissart</em>  is a more recent edition which also employs this strategy, and it provides a very useful detailed list of changes made between the different versions.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup></p>
<p>Another versioning strategy is that in which it is not the edition itself that receives a new version with every update, but the versions of individual web resources which are stored and made accessible for citation using permalinks or PIDs. Version control systems (VCS) can be used for this purpose. Every little change to a resource is recorded and generates a new version. In contrast to the above-mentioned system, the creation of a new version is not triggered by the author or editor. Every change, no matter how small, generates a new version. The benefit of this system is that parts of an SDE can be updated without the need to create a new version of the entire edition. Furthermore, every old and new version is stored and can be referenced and retrieved from an archive. A downside, however, is that if badly executed, this strategy can lead to the creation of an enormous number of unnecessary versions, for instance of irrelevant changes, which might be confusing to a user, require more storage space, and maintenance.</p>
<p>The  <em>Edition Humboldt digital</em>  is an example of an edition which has an archive of older text versions citable via permalinks.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  Moreover, if one accesses one of its old versions, a warning message indicates that a newer version of this transcription is available and points the user to it. The most recent authorized revision of a resource can be then accessed via a canonical URL. There is a significant difference between canonical URLs and the before mentioned canonical numbers. Canonical URLs were introduced out of a practical need to optimise search engine results. They are implemented using an HTML canonical tag the purpose of which is to specify what URL should be listed in the search results.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>  A canonical URL should always point to the newest, accepted version of an online resource. As the canonical URL does not in any way reflect the change of the online resource, it should not be used for citation. While this versioning approach is relatively new to the digital editing community, it has been in use for projects such as Wikipedia for quite a while. Wikipedia is an example of a website where content is constantly changing and where a new version with a permalink results each time an article is edited. The project provides canonical URLs for the most recent, accepted version of an article and permalinks for permanent addressing. Wiki as an editing platform is also being used by digital edition projects. For instance, the  <em>Social Edition of the Devonshire</em>  MS (BL Add. MS 17492) is published via  <em>Wikibooks</em>  and uses the same system as Wikipedia for the visibility of permalinks and versioning information.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Scholarly editions – both in print and in digital form – are reference works for scholarly discourse. Consequently, resources provided by scholarly digital editions (SDE) should be clearly citable and persistently available. This is, however, not always the case as SDEs are often complex websites with different resources and traditional citation style guides do not sufficiently cover this type of website. Furthermore, developers of SDEs often do not provide the necessary bibliographic data and guidance to cite an edition and its resources correctly. Apart from the bibliographic data that is also required for the citation of editions in print, crucial information specific to SDEs has been identified and discussed including permalink, PID, versioning strategies, and granular citation options for digital resources.</p>
<p>As in the digital realm there is no stable physical representative of the edition, the provision of permalinks or PIDs for the scholarly digital edition and its resources is crucial. If online resources are updated and changed, it is necessary to provide stable identifiers for older versions and, ideally, to make them accessible for users. Furthermore, the possibilities and potential for granular citation in scholarly digital editions have been addressed by briefly discussing the strategies used by IIIF, fragment identifiers and the CTS protocol. In this context, it is important to note that a substantial number of texts used in the humanities have established titles and numbers for citation. CTS, DET, dMGH, PHI and similar projects try to translate the logic of traditional into a digital format. By this means not only the edition, but fragments and objects within the edition may be cited in the digital realm using existing and widely used logical structures of a text.</p>
<p>The survey conducted as part of this research has shown that over the past two decades, the awareness of these topics has increased among SDE developers. However, most digital editions still do not sufficiently communicate to the user what can be cited in an SDE and how to do so safely. Citation information is, nevertheless, imperative as each edition may have a different structure, it may also provide a different set of online resources, or use diverse granular citation strategies. Therefore, not providing clear information on how to cite the edition or partial resources may decrease the trust in and the citability of a digital edition. Furthermore, digital editions are produced by teams rather than individuals and the acknowledgement of the individual responsibilities of team members can and should be emphasised by citing these persons alongside the main editor(s) when appropriate. This information needs to be communicated to a user.</p>
<p>A further important point of consideration is the provision of all necessary bibliographic data for citation. The most practical approach for this would appear to be the placing of a citation statement for the entire edition in a prominent position on the home page, and additional citation statements referring to the individual resources provided by the edition. Permalinks and PIDs should be clearly highlighted and it must be communicated to the user that these can and should be used for persistent citation. As the persistent availability of online resources always depends strongly on the institution maintaining them, a digital edition should outline its PID/permalink strategy and policy on the website. Furthermore, users should be informed on how an edition deals with updates and revisions of its resources. A good place for such a statement would be a citation page or the about page. How changes are logged and how old and new versions can be cited is vital information. As a matter of fact, very few online editions will remain unchanged over time. Ideally, a new permalink or PID should be created for every version.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no standardised way to provide citation information in an SDE. Various strategies were discussed in this article and it was occasionally pointed out that some solutions seem to be more frequently used. This might be the first step towards the standardisation of this very important feature of an SDE. However, as there are too many different types of editions covering various subjects, further research is necessary to analyse what kind of citation recommendation fits to different types of editions. Currently, the best advice for editors and developers alike is to provide essential bibliographic data for the citation of an edition easily accessible to the user (ideally in human- and machine-readable form). It is essential for a user to know how to cite the individual resources of the edition and to easily find permalinks/PIDs and information on the versioning strategy of an SDE. Following these basic rules will increase the citability of an edition and help move towards more stability for scholarly online resources.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<p>The _ Book of Disquiet_  (LdoD, from  <em>Livro do Desassossego</em> , in Portuguese) by Fernando Pessoa is a fragmentary literary work that was left unedited and unpublished by the author. In 1982, forty seven years after Pessoa’s death (1935), its first edition was published <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> . Since then, three additional critical editions of the book have appeared, showcasing significant disparities of interpretation about how the book should be organized. Between 2012 and 2017, a team led by two co-authors of this article (Manuel Portela and António Rito Silva) created the  <em>LdoD Archive: A Collaborative Digital Archive of the Book of Disquiet</em>   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The  <em>LdoD Archive</em>  can be described as a hypermedia interactive engine that has realized the vision of an endlessly reconfigurable book. It is both a scholarly digital edition and meta-edition that enables users to compare each version of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  with all of the versions encoded in the archive, and a virtual editing space designed with game-like principles for enabling different types of users (experts, students, general readers) to make their own editions and collections of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> . The stated aim of this evolving archive is to experiment with computational forms of editing, reading, and writing in ways that go beyond the bibliographic imagination <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  – a web application integrated into the  _LdoD Archive _ – explores the reading flow within this complex digital environment.</p>
<p>The modularity of  <em>The Book of Disquiet</em>  is, in fact, the contingent result of material and historical features that tend to reinforce each other: on one hand, each text is a self-contained unit that has no necessary narrative continuity with other texts; on the other hand, there is no defined ordering of the entire corpus of circa 600 pieces. Autograph textual units are also in various stages of revision: first draft manuscripts, typescripts with manuscript emendations, clean typescripts, twelve published texts. Pessoa only defined a few textual clusters, and even those suffered changes over time during the two stages of composition (1913-1920; 1928-1934). Given this contingent modular nature of the book, its fragments can be read regardless of any particular order, offering the opportunity for a fragmentary reading of the book, that is, a practice of reading that fosters divergent reading paths that can be built by the actual reader, instead of following a typical sequential reading that is bound to happen in a rigidly defined story sequence.</p>
<p>In the  <em>LdoD Visual</em> , we used the particular structure and characteristics of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  to explore, and smoothly integrate, two current research trends in Digital Humanities: information visualization techniques applied to texts, including the possibility of moving between close and distant reading scales <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, with the design of web interfaces for accessing complex literary archives and the emergence of e-books as a reading medium <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. We propose a new reading metaphor, the In-Out-In metaphor, which integrates information visualization techniques with the plain reading of the text, to support the focus-digress flow that structures the embodied activity of the reader. By  <em>focus-digress flow</em>  we mean that during the focus stage the reader is in the story, while the digress stage corresponds to moments of self-consciousness of textual form, structure and navigation, as well as associative thought processes, both of which interrupt immersive reading.</p>
<p>We have designed and implemented a web-based application to read the  <em>LdoD</em>  whose main objective is to give the reader a sense of choice and an active role while reading and browsing through the book’s multiple textual fragments, in what should be a pleasurable and immersive user experience for both humanities researchers or just interested readers. The entire rationale of the  _LdoD Archive _ has been to offer a multi-layered access to the text, mediated through specific interfaces for each major function. Interfaces should be meaningfully navigated by interactors with very different levels of knowledge of the text – from the novice to the learner to the expert – and with distinct aims in mind, including leisure reading, study and analysis, advanced research, and literary creation <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal at the level of the reading interface, we integrate a set of meta-information about the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  with information visualization techniques. Information visualization is a broad field that can be applied to a large domain of different areas, providing insight based on input data with different perspectives, summarizing relationships, identifying and comparing patterns, trends, outliers, finding correlations, among other tasks <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. In this project, visualization has been conceived as a humanistic interface for integrating different reading strategies and proving readers with a perception of reading as the traversal of a semiotic space that is both topological and semantic, and which is responsive to the readers’ agency <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In order to integrate the existing meta-information with information visualization techniques we developed a tool, the  <em>LdoD Visual</em> , which supports the exploration and pleasurable reading of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> . The implemented solution provides new contributions for the reading and exploration of this work, in particular, and to the concept of reading flow in Digital Humanities, in general. This tool is built on top of the  <em>Collaborative Digital Archive of the Book of Disquiet</em> , as mentioned. So the visual reader should be understood as a second-degree interactive representation – i.e., an additional interface – for providing a rewarding reading experience of a highly complex corpus of 600 texts. Its conception brings together a metaphoric model of the reading process, on one hand, and an algorithmic and graphical modelling of that process, on the other.</p>
<p>Besides describing the technical and graphical details of the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  as a reading interface, this article makes three related claims. We argue that our computational model of reading interactions is adequate for representing the multiplicity of reading traversals inherent in the  _Book of Disquiet _ as a modular and open network of textual sequences. We also claim that our model of the reading flow as a recurrent process of immersion-emersion can be equated with the networked digital medium itself, insofar as the continuous focus on strings of text required for immersion can be smoothly integrated with the macrotextual logic of the visualizations facilitating textual overviews, hypertextual connections, and frame jumps. Finally, we argue that the ways for moving into, moving within, and moving out of the text provide a satisfactory balance involving two scales of textual representation that could be useful for other digital humanities projects of highly complex textual corpora. We believe the ergonomic solution embodied in our reading interface explicitly integrates close reading, hyper-reading, and machine reading <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>, and thus contributes to the design of new reading interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="2-related-work">2. Related Work</h2>
<p>In this section we present some background concepts regarding the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> , Visualization in Digital Humanities, and Classification in Digital Humanities, the three conceptual and technical contexts in which this work was developed.</p>
<h2 id="21-the-ldod-archive">2.1. The LdoD Archive</h2>
<p>The  <em>LdoD Archive</em>  provides every reader with the possibility of reading the  _Book of Disquiet _ according to _  _ four expert editions: the first critical edition, edited by Jacinto do Prado Coelho <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, which was published in 1982, as well as three critical versions that have been edited by Teresa Sobral Cunha (1990-91 [2008] <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>), Richard Zenith (1998 [2012] <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>) and Jerónimo Pizarro (2010) <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> . Each edition is composed of the total number of fragments and their relative order varies from edition to edition. In the LdoD Archive, the user can read each fragment while comparing its respective position across these expert editions, and they can also have access to additional information, which may also vary according to the edition, such as date and heteronym attribution.</p>
<p>In the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> , users can also create their own virtual editions of the  <em>LdoD</em>  by selecting fragments from each of the 4 expert editions, sorting, annotating and tagging them. This virtual edition creation can be produced in a collaborative manner, in which case several users are involved, and users can play the roles of editors and managers of a virtual edition. The tagging of a fragment, which can apply to the fragment as a whole, or to just a segment of the fragment, is done by means of a set of categories that is associated with the virtual edition. This set of categories is designated as the virtual edition’s taxonomy.</p>
<p>Each fragment has different properties, such as its title, text, date and the edition and categories to which it belongs. There are many more features and possibilities that can be explored in the archive, such as additional reading tools, original documents, comparisons between textual transcriptions, fragment search, multiplayer classification games, and the writing of variations based on the existing fragments.</p>
<h2 id="22-literary-reading-on-the-web">2.2. Literary Reading on the Web</h2>
<p>Whereas hypertext structures in print books are generally subordinated to the sequential flow of textual strings on the page (they gravitate around the text, as table of contents, footnotes, references, etc.), hypertext structures in digital media alter the dynamics between self-contained and associative reading, as they can place any textual string in direct relation to a multiplicity of other texts, thus increasing the ratio of textual interruption. Links among disparate strings of text become much more frequent, and readers follow networks of association in interrupted and labyrinthine traversals. With the emergence of the World Wide Web as a hypermedia environment in the 1990s and early 2000s, the integration of verbal text into multimodal genres of communication continued to transform our media for symbolic production and exchange. More recently, mobile social media and the development of smartphones as multifunctional devices further extended this general transformation of digital literacy.</p>
<p>Even if visionary engineers imagined the future interface of computational devices as a sort of augmented book (as is clear from Alan Kay’s 1972 Dynabook prototype), and even if current electronic tablets somehow attempt to emulate the ergonomics of the portable book, the electronic writing and reading space reconfigures and reforms the set of relations inherited from bibliographic structures. The redesign of information spaces of legacy print forms for the networked screens of programmable media has been a source of continuous reflection and engineering experimentation in many areas – from scholarly editing to commercial publishing to educational tools, particularly since the late 1990s. These transformations have also been studied extensively, from human-computer interaction to studies of literacy to cognitive science <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup><sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Studies seem to concur on the significance of changes to the ecology of reading practices, and on cognitive differences in terms of orientation and comprehension. Complex hypermedia literary archives, such as  <em>The William Blake Archive</em>   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  (under development for almost three decades), have had to adapt to this changing ecology of the web. In those scholarly editing projects combination of search functions, navigation structure and reading interface has undergone several redesigns from highly hierarchical networks of links – typical of the early hypertext remediation of bibliographic structures – to current on-the-fly aggregations based on specific XML-encoding conventions.</p>
<p>Interviewed by Werner Herzog, in  <em>Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World</em>  (2016), Ted Nelson recalls a childhood episode when he was with his grandparents in a row boat, and, trailing his hand in the water, he notices the water flowing around his fingers in intricate patterns of connection. This epiphanic moment gives him awareness of the connectedness of everything which he associates to his future vision of hypertext as a powerful open-ended multidirectional changing system of relations among all texts and all media. Non-sequential hyperlinked literature as an evolving network of transclusions challenges reading practices based on linear forms of writing <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup><sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Although not as flexible and unconstrained as imagined by Nelson, the current mediascape of reading was radically transformed by hypermedia and algorithmic textual production and analysis. Despite the early apology for the liberating, dynamic and heterarchical potential of hypertext by literary theorists and digital writers <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup><sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>, research into hypertext software had always recognized the disorienting effect of link and node structures as both a design and cognitive problem <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>, to which alternative representational and navigational forms, such as spatial hypertext, have been proposed <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup><sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Almost three decades after the first literary experiments with hypermedia, Stuart Moulthrop and Dene Grigar (<a href="#moulthrop2017">2017</a>) have asked four hypertext writers (Judy Malloy, John McDaid, Shelley Jackson, and William Bly) to revisit their early work of the late 1980s and 1990s in order to recover the writing, programming, and reading mechanics involved in their exploratory uses of specific machines and programs, including the emerging conventions of the hyperlink as a resource for poetic and narrative expression. Moulthrop and Grigar’s deep reading of the works of those authors engages the multilayered nature of digital textuality, including the ways in which hypertext and algorithmic processes affect our reading expectations of texts as holistic self-limited entities. The elusiveness of the textual whole is inherent in the intricate topologies created not just by hyper-reading as an unbounded and labyrinthine traversal, but also by the factorial virtualization of text as a responsive permutation of language bits.</p>
<p>Many of the same cognitive challenges of early digital genres continue to be addressed in the design of dedicated e-book readers and in current attempts to create a satisfactory balance between competing reading modes in digital media. Several analyses have been done on the hardware and software features for reading in electronic environments <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> that highlight the differences between linear sequential reading and multicursal interactive reading, which are particularly relevant in the context of academic research or education. This tension between continuity and discontinuity pervades all solutions, in which there is a tradeoff between the smooth flow of reading and the possibility of analysis and inquiry about what is being read. If we think of Digital Humanities as the coming together of digitized artifacts, digitized methods for modelling and analyzing those artifacts, and digitized interfaces for representing those artifacts and those analyses, then the development of reading interfaces remains an important component in the invention of rhetorical conventions and modes of communication in networked programmable media.</p>

<p>In the comparison user interface, it is possible to have a detailed highlighting of the differences between the authorial sources and the editorial transcriptions, and also across the editorial transcriptions themselves. It is also possible to annotate particular texts (or textual passages) with comments and tags when specific texts are used in the creation of a virtual edition.</p>
<p>The differences between transcriptions among the different expert editions, and authorial sources, are highlighted by placing the fragments side by side, and using colors to identify which parts differ. This user interface also allows the comparison of meta-information assigned by the expert editors, such as title, date of publication, heteronym attribution, page number, which can differ according to the edition. Additionally, this interface also allows users to compare the transcription with the original document sources, by presenting the documents’ facsimiles and providing a diplomatic transcription, which includes deletions, insertions and substitutions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and since the  <em>LdoD Archive</em>  also supports the definition of virtual editions, it is possible, through the comparison user interface, to compare the differences between the fragments, in terms of the assigned tags and annotations done. It is through the comparison interface that authenticated users can annotate and tag the fragments.</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Due to the focus of the comparison user interface on the analysis aspects, another user interface was defined, in order to provide a smother reading experience, although still emphasizing the comparison between the different sequences of reading the  <em>LdoD</em> . This interface has a look and feel closer to the printed typography of the period the  <em>LdoD</em>  was written, and intends to provide reading sequences according to each one of the four expert editions. Besides, it provides a recommendation interface that suggests the next fragment to read, given the fragment being read and a set of criteria, such as, for instance, text similarity between fragments.</p>
<p>We could say that the reading interface for comparing editions is aimed at scholarly engagements with the text, whereas the reading interface for showing divergent reading sequences is meant for general readers. In the latter interface readers have the option of reading vertically within a particular sequence or horizontally across the entire corpus, thus redefining their textual traversal according to the multicursal logic of the medium which, in turn, is critically used to explore the modular structure of the work itself. On the other hand, the aim of the new visual reader is to abstract textual units and their meta-information and present them visually in ways that enhance movements within and across the text. The hypertextual and textual dynamics of the  _LdoD Visual _ embodies an ergonomic and cognitive model of the reading process in the design of the interactions.</p>
<h2 id="23-visualization-in-digital-humanities">2.3. Visualization in Digital Humanities</h2>
<p>Jänicke et al. (<a href="#janicke2015">2015</a>, <a href="#janicke2017">2017</a>) address visual text analysis in Digital Humanities and categorize each of these techniques as distant reading techniques, which aim to generate an abstract view of textual content, and as close reading techniques, which rely mainly on annotations and the use of different colors and underlining styles to lead to a deep comprehension and thorough interpretation of textual passages. They analyze how close and distant reading techniques can be combined in ways that could bridge these two perspectives so that the user can switch between close and distant reading. This is mainly achieved by side-by-side visualizations of the text being read and its meta-information, which make it possible to switch from a close reading of a particular fragment to some kind of overview associated with specific metadata. On the other hand, it is possible to access a particular text from the distant reading view where the text is represented because it has properties that are analyzed in that distant reading mode <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. This integration between close and distant reading is similar to our goal but our emphasis is on providing a reading experience, while the integration of close and distant reading is concerned with the analysis and understanding of the texts, such that close reading is frequently related with the annotation and generation of meta-information while the user is reading a text.</p>
<h2 id="231-visualization-techniques-for-ldod">2.3.1. Visualization Techniques for LdoD</h2>
<p>Given the specific characteristics of the  <em>LdoD</em>  we can analyze which visualization technique can be applied in its representation. These techniques belong to different areas and types of tasks, such as reading guidance, user navigation, global view, and exploratory analysis.</p>
<p>Reading guidance features consist of giving important information for the user regarding a specific fragment or even a collection or category of fragments, where the focus is on the fragment that is currently being read. User navigation features provide the user with an interface to navigate between different parts of the  <em>LdoD</em> , in which the focus is on the relationship between the fragment being currently read and the remaining fragments of the book. Global view features have the objective of giving the user a summarized presentation or zoomed-out view of content from the  <em>LdoD</em> , thus directing the focus to the edition that is being read. Exploratory analysis features present the user with information that is more focused on exploring relationships in the  <em>LdoD</em>  without necessarily converging to the task of reading.</p>
<p>Word clouds <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup><sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> can be used to provide global views and reading guidance. Word clouds can be associated with the taxonomy categories of a virtual edition. After being presented with a word cloud of the available categories, and clicking on one of them, the user would be redirected to a list of fragments that corresponds to the selected category.</p>
<p>Also by exploring the categories associated with the virtual editions, it is possible to provide a global view of the edition, using colors to identify those fragments associated with a particular category. This feature would provide a global view of the fragments tagged with that category and the navigation to another fragment that is associated to the same category. This visualization technique, is, for instance, used in the Diggersdiaries web site <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Besides the categories criterion, other criteria are supported by the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> , such as text and heteronym, and they can be used to define a distance value between fragments. In this case, when reading a given fragment, the user could browse through similar fragments according to the selected criteria, and this relation can be visually represented using a network graph to show how close certain fragments are in relation to others. This would provide reading guidance. Alexander and Gleicher (<a href="#alexander2016">2016</a>) make use of network graphs to visualize text similarity between different work by William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>By highlighting some of the fragments’ words according to their relevance in the context of the entire book it is possible to provide a guidance while reading a fragment. The weight of this highlighting could be made resorting to a metric like Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> . Text Skimming <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup><sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> is a technique used in knowledge maps and to support reading and it can also be applied in this context.</p>
<p>There are some differences between the experience of reading a book on a browser or other portable virtual book readers and the actual physical book. In an attempt to close this gap, it would be interesting to provide the user with a graphical representation that makes the awareness of where the actual reading fragment is placed in the current edition. This type of feature belongs to the global view area.</p>
<h2 id="24-text-classification">2.4. Text Classification</h2>
<p>The visualization techniques are built on top of the information to be presented plus some meta-information. In the context of the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> , the information is the fragment transcription and its position in an edition, and the meta-information is the date, heteronym and categories assigned to a fragment. Additionally, some meta-information is generated from the fragment through the TF-IDF associated with it, by considering each fragment as a document and the words in the fragment its set of terms.</p>
<h2 id="241distance-measures-in-the--_ldod-archive_">2.4.1.Distance Measures in the  <em>LdoD Archive</em></h2>
<p>The  <em>LdoD Archive</em>  implements a set of measures to calculate the distance between two fragments belonging to the same edition according to four types of meta-information: date, heteronym, categories, and TF-IDF. The distance between two fragments is calculated using the cosine similarity <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>, according to which a vector is defined for each of the fragments to be compared.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>
<p>Associated with the heteronym, a vector of two cells is defined, one for each heteronym, Vicente Guedes and Bernardo Soares, in which the value 1.0 is assigned to the cell of the heteronym if the fragment is assigned by the editors to it.</p>
<p>For the date, a vector is defined with the number of cells equal to 1934-1913+1, which corresponds to the period when the fragments were written. For the cell corresponding to the year when a fragment was written, the value 1.0 is assigned and for the other cells a decay of MAX(0.0, 1.0 - N x 0.1) is applied where N is the distance between the year associated with the cell and the closest cell with value 1.0.</p>
<p>For the text, the set of the first 100 TF-IDF terms associated with each one of the fragments that we intend to compare is calculated. Note that this set is between 100, in which the two fragments have the same first TF-IDF 100 terms, and 200, in which all terms are different. Then, for each fragment, a vector whose size equals the number of terms in the set is defined, and to the cell associated with a term the value 1.0 is assigned if the term belongs to the first 100 TF-IDF terms of the fragment, and 0.0 otherwise.</p>
<p>To calculate the distance between two fragments using the set of categories assigned to them a vector whose size is equal to the number of categories associated with the virtual edition taxonomy is defined. Then, for each fragment, its respective vector is filled with 1.0 for the cells corresponding to the categories the fragment has, and 0.0 for the other cells.</p>
<p>Note that the archive also uses a topic modelling algorithm, through the Mallet software<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> , which allows the virtual editions to be automatically classified using the set of generated topics.</p>
<h2 id="3-the-in-out-in-metaphor">3. The In-Out-In Metaphor</h2>
<p>Reading a book is a task in which the reader constantly switches between two states of focus. The reader is either completely engaged in the reading task or briefly disengages out of the act for various reasons. These moments of disengagement can be triggered, for example, by recalling what happened in previous chapters, picturing a description of a character or scenario, remembering a similar personal experience in relation to what has been read, linking a new event to what has happened in the past or even trying to make a prediction out of it, among other possibilities. Immersion can also be interrupted by the readers’ self- awareness of form, structure and navigation. The in-moment represents the state of being inside the textual world, absorbed by its signifying chain. The out-moment points to the liminal state of being outside the text, a liminality that is a function of the text itself and the ways in which it draws attention to its materiality or generates mental processes of association and reflection.</p>
<p>Part of our solution model revolves around this phenomenon, as it is intended to materialize and direct this constant in and out that happens while emerging out of and submerging into the source text. It is important to highlight that, in comparison to a typical book where we have a rigidly defined story sequence, the  <em>LdoD</em>  is a fragmentary literary work. This means that these moments of disengagement can turn into a chance for the user to reposition herself in another part of the book. This nuance leads to a reading path and global mental picture of the world created by the book that can greatly vary from reader to reader, opening up space for providing the user with an immersive experience in which she can have a sense of choice and an active role while reading the  <em>LdoD</em> . If we consider that genre is an emergent property that results from specific arrangements of textual units, readers of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  - mediated by this in-out-in visual reader – may even experience the oscillation between fictional autobiography and fragmentary narrative as an effect of their traversals. The emergence of a variable textual whole becomes a function of their reading acts. Self-contained textual units, when traversed as reading text, correspond to the in-movement, but when navigated as visual representations correspond to the out-movement.</p>
<h2 id="4-the-ldod-visual">4. The LdoD Visual</h2>
<p>The solution’s interface is composed of a group of different main menus: edition selection, reading, current user activity, new user activity, and reading history menus. Before describing each menu in detail, it is important to explain the concepts that will be used throughout this solution proposal.</p>
<h2 id="41-core-concepts">4.1. Core Concepts</h2>
<p>An  <em>information visualization technique</em> , among other descriptions in previous sections, is a visual representation or metaphor that can provide insight and different perspectives about almost any type of input data, as we saw above from the multiple examples given in the related work applied to the context of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> .</p>
<p><em>Semantic criteria</em>  is the set of attributes that can be encoded in the information visualization techniques in the context of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> , namely word frequency, word relevance (TF-IDF), chronological order, heteronyms, fragment categories, and taxonomies. Text similarity is another semantic criterion that can be derived from word frequency and word relevance.</p>
<p>A  <em>user activity</em>  is an activity that can be selected by the user while reading a fragment from the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> , consisting of making use of an  <em>information visualization technique</em>  to encode different  <em>semantic criteria</em> . An example of a user activity is  “Find similar fragments by text similarity”  to find fragments that are similar to the fragment that is currently being accessed, using a network graph as the information visualization technique that encodes text similarity - the semantic criterion that is chosen by the user while selecting the new user activity. To achieve an intuitive and easy-to-use solution, independently of the user activity&rsquo;s information visualization technique and encoded semantic criteria, the user selects a user activity by clicking on a button with a high-level description of what the user activity was designed to achieve, e.g.  “Find similar fragments by text similarity” .</p>
<p>A  <em>reading flow</em>  is a sequence of accesses, done by a single user, such that the user progresses in the sequence of fragments through in-in, in-out-in and  <em>in-out-out-in</em>  subflows. An  <em>in-in</em>  subflow corresponds to a situation when the user is accessing a fragment and accesses another fragment, for instance, by switching to the previous page. This switch is done according to the  <em>semantic criteria</em>  the user chose for accessing the fragment, defined by the current user activity. For instance, if the semantic criteria correspond to the set of fragments of a given category, the reader will access another fragment belonging to the same category. An  <em>in-out-in</em>  subflow corresponds to a situation in which the user is accessing a fragment, moves to the current user activity menu (to be described in the next subsections) in which the reader has a complete view of the fragments according to the same semantic criteria used to access the fragment being read. For instance, if we consider the previous example, the complete view may show all fragments that have the same category in the context of all fragments. An  <em>in-out-out-in</em>  subflow corresponds to a situation when the reader stops reading, according to the current user activity, and chooses a new user activity in which she continues to read.</p>
<p>Overall, the reading flow corresponds to the implementation of the  <em>in-out</em>  metaphor, where the level of disruption is minimal in  <em>in-in</em>  subflows, and maximal in  <em>in-out-out-in</em>  subflows. Note that to reduce the disruption of the reading flow, all changes can be done using shortcuts, pressing a single key, and most menu elements fade-out in the reading interface when the reader does not use the mouse so that the screen only contains the text of the fragment.</p>
<h2 id="42-user-interface-structure-menus-and-navigation">4.2. User Interface Structure: Menus and Navigation</h2>
<p>In the context of an edition, the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  has three main types of elements: selection menus, reading view, and global views.</p>
<h2 id="421-user-activity-selection-menu">4.2.1. User Activity Selection Menu</h2>
<p>Once a context of an edition and one of its fragments is chosen, the main selection menu allows users to choose between the available user activities, given the context, and access the corresponding global view. The user activities are ordered by semantic criteria: edition order, chronological order, text similarity, categories/taxonomy, and heteronym.</p>

</figure>
<p>As shown in Figure 3, each user activity is represented by a card with a title, a button with the corresponding keyboard shortcut between straight parentheses that will take the user to the activity, and an image that represents the information visualization technique for that user activity, which can also be clicked to access the user activity.</p>
<p>The image and button will be greyed out if the activity is unavailable - for example, if the currently selected edition has no taxonomy, user activities that use this semantic criteria category will not be available, displaying a message explaining why it is not available in the title and its selection button is also unavailable.</p>
<p>The same semantic criteria can be used with different information visualization techniques. In Figure 3, we can observe that the top 2nd and bottom 1st cards use different information visualization techniques for chronological order, respectively, custom square map and timeline; the top 3rd, bottom 3rd and 4th cards use the semantic criteria associated with the taxonomies, where top and bottom 3rd use the same information visualization technique, word cloud, the former in the context of the selected edition, and the latter in the context of the selected fragment; while the bottom 4th uses a different visualization technique, network graph.</p>
<h2 id="422-reading-view">4.2.2. Reading View</h2>
<p>In this view, the focus is on reading the text of a selected fragment, as represented in Figure 4, where the fragment title and text are presented with a reading progress bar. Since the text will be read on a screen, the used text font is a sans serif font. The fragment title font and text font are the same ones used in one of the  <em>LdoD Archive</em>  reading interfaces.</p>

<p>Besides the progress reading bar, the reading view features some elements of established browser book readers (see Figure 5). There are previous/next fragment arrow buttons that retreat/advance through the selected edition fragments depending on the currently selected edition. It also allows users to navigate between fragments according to the user selected category or heteronym, using the yellow arrows. There are some detail features, such as smooth animation between fragment change and smooth page scroll back to the top for the same matter. This smooth page scroll can also be triggered by clicking on its matching button or pressing  “T”  on the keyboard.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the user stays inactive for more than 3 seconds, everything in this menu disappears with the exception of the reading progress bar and the fragment&rsquo;s title and text, as shown in Figure 4. Inactivity is timed when the user is not interacting with any button, progress bar or previous/next fragment arrow buttons. It is then possible to trigger everything to appear again by doing a mouse hover on any of these elements of the menu. When the user scrolls down the page and the top buttons overlap the text, there is also a transparency trigger. These features are activated as an effort to maximize the user focus on reading the text and are another extra step towards achieving our metaphor implementation.</p>
<p>In this menu, there is a user activity &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; in the sense that it resembles a user activity that does not break the reading flow: by clicking on the matching button ( “Highlight the most relevant words” ), left button on top (shortcut [R]), the 4 most relevant words are highlighted in blue, as presented in Figure 5. This number was decided after extensive experimentation and fine tuning, trying to find a balance between actual relevant content highlighting and not highlighting too many words to the point it becomes irrelevant to do so. This option makes use of an information visualization technique - text skimming - to encode a semantic criterion - word relevance (more specifically, TF-IDF) -, even though it is not described as a user activity in the sense that it can be applied independently of what is the current user’s activity.</p>
<p>The reader can also see his/her own history of reading by pressing the button on the right in the group of three buttons on top (shortcut [H]), as presented in Figure 6.</p>

</figure>
<p>In this view, the reader is presented with an interactive timeline that displays the fragments that have been read for the currently selected edition. Each history entry is a fragment, displaying its title and a thumbnail that represents the information visualization technique of the user activity through which that fragment was reached. Besides, having a similar interaction to the user activity that makes use of the timeline in the global view, the user can navigate back to a given fragment that was previously read by clicking on its entry.</p>
<p>The buttons on top right, Figure 5, allow the user to see the instructions for this menu and select another edition. The two first buttons in the group of three buttons allow the user to access the global view associated with the currently selected user activity (shortcut [A]) and to navigate to the new user activity selection menu (shortcut [N]).</p>
<h2 id="423-global-views">4.2.3. Global Views</h2>
<p>The global views correspond to the  <em>out</em>  phase of the metaphor and are a combination of semantic criteria with an information visualization technique. In the following subsections we show how the global views are presented in the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  in the context of the various information visualization techniques.</p>
<h2 id="4231-network-graph">4.2.3.1. Network Graph</h2>
<p>This information visualization technique consists of a network graph with hidden edges, as shown in Figure 7. Each node is a circle that represents a fragment from the currently selected edition. If the user clicks on a circle, she will be taken back to the  <em>Reading Menu</em>  with the corresponding fragment of that circle open to be read.</p>
<p>When accessing the view, the central orange circle represents the fragment in whose context the user activity was started, and the purple circle represents the fragment being currently read. This strategy was adopted so that the reading occurring during a user activity is contextualized by the initially read fragment. The blue circles represent the other fragments from the edition, and their relative distance to the central circle expresses the encoded semantic criterion.</p>

        <p>Global View using a Network Graph for the semantic criteria of text similarity. The closest circle will always be in the same position, be it 5% or 100% similar, to allow a sparser representation, note that, for instance, when considering text similarity, the most similar fragments are less than 20% similar. Color encodes the similarity in percentage. There is a blue color range - a 100% similar fragment will have its corresponding circle colored in light blue, while a 0% similar fragment will have its corresponding circle colored in dark blue.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The user can put the mouse cursor over the circle so that a label is displayed, showcasing the title and the value of similarity in percentage. Besides being able to drag and zoom the network graph using the mouse pointer and mouse wheel, the user can also use the green navigation buttons to drag, re-size, zoom in and out of the network graph. This information visualization technique is used to encode similarity by text and taxonomy, which in the case of Figure 7 is by text.</p>
<h2 id="4232-word-cloud">4.2.3.2. Word Cloud</h2>
<p>Word clouds are used to encode semantic criteria associated with the categories of a certain fragment or taxonomy (group of categories) of the selected edition, as shown in Figure 8. It displays each category using different colors and the font size varies according to the number of fragments that belong to that category.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Word Cloud, and its semantic criteria, can be applied in two cases: (1) the set of categories of the taxonomy of an edition, which corresponds to the case presented in Figure 8; (2) the categories of the current fragment. In both cases, by selecting one of the categories, the user is redirected to a custom squares map that highlights the fragments of the select category, as described in the next subsection.</p>
<p>Heimerl et al. (<a href="#heimerl2014">2014</a>) developed a system that uses word clouds as its central visualization method for interactive text analysis. Its results showed that even though word clouds are aesthetically pleasing with its words disposed in different angles, users do not find them very functional and easy to use. Thus, results showed that participants preferred sequential layouts, where words are placed horizontally without any kind of inclination or angles for aesthetic purposes. For this reason, we decided to follow the same layout in the  <em>LdoD Visual</em> .</p>
<h2 id="4233-custom-squares-map">4.2.3.3. Custom Squares Map</h2>
<p>This information visualization technique consists of squares linked by arrows, as shown in Figure 9. It is similar to the network graph if we picture the squares as nodes and the arrows as edges. Likewise, each square represents a fragment from the currently selected edition. This group of squares linked by arrows offers a global view of the currently selected edition, and suggests a certain order derived from the arrows. This order depends on the encoded criterion. Each square&rsquo;s color and highlighting also depends on the encoded criterion. Similarly to network graphs, there is a special color highlighting for each square. The orange square corresponds to the fragment where the user activity was initiated, and the purple square to the fragment currently being read.</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This information visualization technique is used to encode the following semantic criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Edition order.</em>  Fragment squares are sorted by order of the currently selected edition. If the user places the mouse cursor over a square, it will display a label with the fragment title and its position in the edition, almost as if it were a page number. This global view allows users to explore the order of the fragments in the edition.</li>
<li><em>Chronological order.</em>  Fragment squares are sorted by the date in which they were written. Each square displays a two-digit number that represents the year from that date - for example, a fragment from 1927 will have its corresponding square with the number 27. Fragments without date have their corresponding squares greyed out. If the user places the mouse cursor over a square, a label will be displayed containing the fragment title and its date. This global view allows users to explore the edition ordered by date.</li>
<li><em>Categories/taxonomy.</em>  Fragments are displayed exactly as if the semantic criterion was the edition&rsquo;s order, with the addition of highlighting in yellow the squares of the fragments from the selected category. If the user places the mouse cursor over a square, a label will be displayed with the fragment title and the categories to which it belongs, as shown in Figure 9. As previously described, smaller yellow previous/next fragment arrow buttons will appear under the black previous/next buttons in the reading menu.</li>
<li><em>Heteronym.</em>  It has the same behaviour as the categories/taxonomy semantic criteria, but it highlights in yellow the squares of the fragments that were assigned to a specific heteronym. The yellow arrow buttons are used to move exclusively to the previous/next fragment belonging to the selected heteronym. The global view allows users to explore the fragments assigned to a particular heteronym.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4234-timeline">4.2.3.4. Timeline</h2>
<p>This information visualization technique consists of an interactive timeline, in which the user is presented with the timeline centered on the time window around the currently selected fragment, as shown in Figure 10.</p>

<p>There is only one global view that uses this information visualization technique to encode the chronological order as the semantic criterion, in order to explore the fragments around the date of the current fragment. Each timeline entry represents a fragment from the currently selected edition. Being consistent with the color scheme for other visualizations, an entry will be orange if it represents the fragment that was initially selected in the context of the user activity, and purple if it is the fragment currently being read. The user can navigate to a certain fragment by clicking on its entry.</p>
<h2 id="5-results-and-discussion">5. Results and Discussion</h2>
<p>The evaluation of the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  was done by two types of tests: usability tests, which assess the system’s usability, independently of the its particular purpose; and, utility tests, which assess the quality of the system, considering its purpose as a reading tool for the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> .</p>
<h2 id="51-usability-tests">5.1. Usability Tests</h2>
<p>To assess how usable, efficient and satisfying the interaction with the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  is, we have performed tests with 11 volunteer users who have no expert knowledge on the  <em>LdoD Archive</em>  and on the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> . The results of this type of test are objective and quantitative.</p>
<p>Each usability test consisted of 4 stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the user to the  <em>LdoD Visual</em> &rsquo;s concepts and briefly demonstrate the system in about 5 minutes;</li>
<li>Let the user explore the system freely for about 5 minutes;</li>
<li>Ask the user to execute 10 tasks;</li>
<li>Ask the user to fill and submit a SUS (system usability scale) questionnaire.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the third stage, for each task, we counted the number of errors and time taken to complete the task. The tasks assess the usability and intuition of the user activities&rsquo; interaction with the information visualization techniques in order to explore and navigate through the fragments from the selected editions. For instance, to select any fragment from an edition, select the user activity that makes use of the squares map encoding the edition&rsquo;s order, choose the first fragment, highlight the most relevant words and say out loud what are the most relevant words of the selected fragment, which was, actually, task 9.</p>
<p>These tasks were always executed in the same order for each user, exactly from the same menus.</p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="Table of time needed to perform each task" src="/dhqwords/vol/15/3/000569/resources/images/10000201000003FF00000122CCE88557A61A9DA0.png"

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 11 presents the results from which we conclude that, on average, every task was completed without exceeding the expected time and with basically no errors, with the exception of the last task, which was more difficult. Task 10 was conceived to confirm if users understood why a user activity was not available for certain fragments and what they should do in order to select other fragments that supported that previously unavailable user activity. This was the most complex task, which explains why it took the most time out of all tasks, even though most users ended up figuring out what they had to do.</p>
<p>For the fourth stage, the users filled and submitted a SUS (system usability scale) questionnaire. This is a quick questionnaire that is commonly used to figure out if any aspect was not considered by the tests. This questionnaire involved 10 statements for the user to answer how much he would agree with each one of them in a scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree):</p>

<p>The score of the SUS questionnaire is obtained by transforming the 1 to 5 scale in a 0 to 4 scale, and converting the values to be consistent, e.g., the odd-number questions express a positive opinion and even-number questions express a negative opinion. Figure 12 presents the results, where the questions&rsquo; answer values are as given by the subjects, and the sums, averages and SUS final scores are calculated on the converted values.</p>

<p>Analyzing the SUS score, we can observe that the lowest scoring answer is number 4,  <em>I think I would need help from a person with technical knowledge to use LdoD Visual</em> . This makes sense as the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  is relatively complex to users that have no experience with the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  and the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> , which is the case of the participants. Regarding the final score, when a system scores a SUS score of 80.3 or more, it is considered to be in the top 10% of scores and the testing users are more likely to recommend it to others. This means that if we are considering a SUS scale, the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  is a system with good usability, having a SUS score of 88.41.</p>
<p>Besides these 10 SUS questions, we also added questions in order to know about the users. In terms of the characterization of the usability test participants: 9.1% where younger than 18, 36.4% between 18-24, 45.5% between 25-34, and 9.1% between 45-54; and 9,1% have secondary education, 45.5% have a bachelor degree, and 45.5% a master degree. Most users had already used other software to read books in the past and most users had not read the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> . It is also possible to observe that most users strongly agreed that they would have a good reading experience using the  <em>LdoD Visual</em> .</p>
<h2 id="52-utility-tests">5.2. Utility Tests</h2>
<p>The purpose of the utility tests is to obtain information about the utility and quality of the experience while using the system. These tests are important in the sense they allow us to assess subjective and qualitative aspects of the  <em>LdoD Visual</em> , which are difficult to be measured quantitatively.</p>
<p>The tests were done with 3 users that have expert knowledge about the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  and the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> . The user of the first case study is a postdoctoral researcher with a PhD thesis on the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> . This user has also worked, between 2012 and 2015, with the XML encoding of the fragments for the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> . The user of the second case study is a PhD student from the PhD Program in Materialities of Literature, which is a doctoral program that addresses the material and technological mediations of literary practices. One of its research fields is digital humanities. This user has a BA and an MA in graphic design. The user of the third case study is another PhD student from the same PhD Program, who has a BA in graphic design, and an MA in Semiotics. This user is interested in the aspects of usability of the  <em>LdoD Archive</em>  since her PhD project involves creative practices through the situated use of the archive. She is one of  <em>LdoD Archive</em> &rsquo;s most regular users and has been organizing a plan of activities to teach  <em>LdoD Archive</em> &rsquo;s users how to use it and fully explore its various functionalities, including the creation of virtual editions.</p>
<p>The protocol for this type of testing is more flexible in comparison to the usability tests&rsquo; protocol. The users were contacted by email, introduced to the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  metaphor, and encouraged to explore the system before we had our actual meeting to do the case study.</p>
<p>During the case study the users were encouraged to use the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  while  “thinking out loud” . We asked them several questions regarding the real utility, potential and reading experience that they thought the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  provides. We also asked them about the differences they felt as more important, in comparison to other tools and electronic readers available, as well as comparing the reading experience of the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  to the other reading features available in the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> .</p>
<p>Considering the feedback received from these case studies, we can conclude that the reception of the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  is positive, both in terms of concept, execution and utility. The users liked the approach on how to read a book. They thought that it is a good match for the fragmentary nature of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> . The attempt to output a visual representation of the editions and fragments brings a new perspective on how to read and explore the  _Book of Disquiet _ and use the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> , highlighting its relevance for the field of digital humanities.</p>
<p>The second user also described her experience with user activities in a way that suggested that the  <em>LdoD Visual</em> &rsquo;s metaphor is successfully implemented. She stated:  “The real reading customization strength comes from the activities around the currently selected fragment. If the reader stops and tries, for example, to continue her reading path with a user activity that is related with reading similar fragments by text to the currently selected fragment, there is already a reflexive question that is specific to the reader and the navigation method centered around the selected fragment becomes the medium for the user to be able to read around an idea that is interesting to her. In  <em>LdoD Visual</em> , the reader is able to navigate through the fragments according to what is desired, having a visual reference of the type of navigation and exploration that is being performed in the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> .”</p>
<p>The users also suggested that the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  is relatively complex and that there should exist more ways of welcoming non-expert users who are not aware of the problem and structure of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  and the the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> , such as &ldquo;selling the concept&rdquo; both as a ludic and research tool, and showcasing the different uses and possibilities in videos scattered around the application. The users also acknowledged the potential of the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  concepts such that they could be developed and expanded to explore other alternatives of interaction with the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> . We could observe that each user spent time with different parts and user activities of the  <em>LdoD Visual</em> . Our analysis on this is that the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  seems to provide different affordances for different users, and that the objective of customizing the exploration and reading experience of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  was met.</p>
<p>We can also conclude that the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  is a tool that mainly scripts two different reading behaviours: the possibility of navigating through the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  with a focus on the pleasurable assisted user-driven reading experience, geared towards a continuous and immersive flow; and the possibility of navigating with a humanities researcher mindset, finding patterns, correlations and textual data insights, according to a discontinuous and interruptive logic. Both of these reading practices are possible resorting to the same mechanisms and representational strategies, i.e., the user activities&rsquo; information visualization techniques, even though the first type of reading practice is the main focus of the  <em>LdoD Visual</em> .</p>
<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  by Fernando Pessoa is an unfinished book that can be read in any order. The modular nature of this fragmentary literary work brings endless possibilities on how it can be traversed.The goal of this work was to design and implement a web-based application to read  <em>The Book of Disquiet</em> , giving the reader an active role while reading and browsing through the book&rsquo;s different fragments, defining user activities that make use of information visualization techniques to encode different semantic criteria.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, we researched on the use of information visualization techniques applied to textual data and literature, and on the concept and tools for e-books and web-based reading. Afterwards, we defined the  <em>in-out-in</em>  metaphor that was used as the guiding concept for whether or not a certain architecture or feature choice met the objectives and served the overall purpose of this work.</p>
<p>According to this metaphor, we defined the user activity concept, which establishes a perspective on how to read the book. A user activity is a combination of an information visualization technique with a semantic criterion, where the latter is used to classify the fragments and the former to visualize them according to the classification. The solution architecture considers three types of user interfaces: a user interface in which the user activity is selected; a global view in which the fragments are visualized according to the chosen user activity; and a reading view to support the reading and navigation between fragments, according to the chosen semantic criteria.</p>
<p>The final system was tested for usability and utility, and it got positive feedback from both non-expert and expert users of the  _Book of Disquiet _ and the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> . The usability tests have shown that it is possible to complete the defined tasks in the expected time and without errors, and the utility tests also confirmed that the proposed metaphor meets the experts’ vision of the book and how to explore its multiple paths of reading.</p>
<p>As a web-based application for exploring the process of reading, the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  contains several features that correspond to what the  <em>LdoD Archive</em>  describes as  “the simulation principle,”  that is, the ability to provide interactors with a reflexive engagement with the textual environment <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Through a recursive process of going into the text and coming out of the text, readers are able to explore the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  as a particular kind of reading experience and they are also able to see how their acts of engaging with the text become registered in the visualizations. The implemented visualization techniques thus bring together the modularization of the text and the modularization of the reading of the text.</p>
<p>The  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  is a tool that has the potential to grow and become an improved version of what it already accomplishes. One major improvement would be the possibility of saving the reading history state to a user account, preferably in the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> . This would be a logical extension since the process of reading a book can take days, weeks or months. Another improvement would be developing a feature to generate new virtual editions according to specific reading paths. This would explore the  <em>LdoD Archive</em>  goal of fostering the construction of new virtual editions of the  <em>Book of Disquiet</em> . In its reflexive graphical representation of reading activities, this visual reader contributes to the experimental textual rationale of the  <em>LdoD Archive</em> .</p>
<p>We believe the In-Out-In metaphor adopted in this project can also be used as a conceptual design tool for modelling reading processes in digital media. The design of interfaces for complex archives of literary materials based on this model would have twofold benefits: limiting hypertextual disorientation, on one hand, and supporting a meaningful transition between human and machine reading processes, on the other, for both general and expert readers. In this light, the model of the reading flow embodied in the  <em>LdoD Visual</em>  could also be seen as a prototype of a specifically digital paratextual apparatus for the smooth and optimal integration of close reading and distant reading modes through multiple visualization techniques.</p>

<p>Pessoa’s c. 28,000 unpublished papers remained in the possession of his family until the late 1970s when they were acquired by the National Library of Portugal. After this, the systematic cataloguing, editing, and publication of his works became possible. Although several books had been in circulation between the 1940s and the 1970s, namely those including the poetry of his major heteronyms (Alberto Caeiro, Álvaro de Campos, and Ricardo Reis), it was only in the 1980s that the critical editing of his manuscripts, typescripts, and published works started. The  <em>Book of Disquiet</em>  was published in two volumes in 1982. The Critical Edition of the Works of Fernando Pessoa, launched in 1984 by the Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda (general editor, Ivo Castro), is still in progress. Twenty-two volumes have been published since then.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The editors of  <em>The William Blake Archive</em>    _ have_  redesigned its graphical user interface in December 2016, distinguishing between a Gallery Mode and a Reading Mode. This structure reflects both the pictorial and literary character of Blake’s work and the intermedia nature of digital environments as a remediation of multiple analogue materialities. It also highlights the deep modularization of Blake’s work that resulted from establishing the planographic digital facsimile of the printed page as its universal unit of representation. Because of their hypermedia complexity, digital archives of this type remain a challenge for all types of reader.

<p>Despite the growth of digital humanities (DH) centres and programmes during the last twenty years, the provision of digital humanities training in the United Kingdom is still unevenly distributed across universities and varies in format from dedicated Masters and Doctoral programmes to more informal seminars and research groups. For smaller or less research-intensive institutions, the establishment of a digital humanities programme usually begins with the recruitment of a single specialist lecturer <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, who may however struggle to cover the breadth of expertise required to provide suitably wide-spectrum teaching. While a number of doctoral students may want to undertake a specific digital humanities PhD supervised by a specialist, many may desire to acquire digital humanities skills without wanting to specialise in the field and make it the centre of their research career. UK Arts and Humanities PhD programmes are not as structured as their US counterparts, though students are required to do a certain amount of training <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The direction of the training is left largely to the students’ own choice; a form of hidden curriculum  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The provision of DH training at PhD level in the UK is shaped by the cyclical nature of the funding context. Since the early 2000s, the funding of doctoral training in the UK has moved away from single institutions or individual studentships towards building multi-institution clusters. Initially focused on a regional basis, the approach later moved to more multi-layered geographical models, with research-intensive universities securing a prominent role in the new structures <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. The eleven Doctoral Training Partnerships (DTPs) funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) offer participating universities the possibility of pooling the expertise of individual specialists to provide more extensive coverage, especially in emerging areas such as DH (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>).</p>

<p>One of the DTPs included in our survey is the Consortium of Humanities and Arts South-East England (CHASE) DTP <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Founded in 2014 as part of the DTP1 funding round, it initially comprised seven institutions: the universities of East Anglia; Essex; Kent; Sussex; Goldsmiths, University of London; the Courtauld Institute; The Open University. Two more joined in 2016: Birkbeck College and the School of Oriental and African Studies. CHASE is now proceeding with a revised membership for its DTP2 second phase, during 2019-2024. This research is concerned with CHASE phase 1, the period 2014-2019, during which CHASE offered seventy-five doctoral studentships per annum, enrolling a total of 373 students over five years.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  This article will discuss the implementation of a DH training programme in the CHASE DTP.</p>
<p>The provision of training is a central element of doctoral funding in the UK, in keeping with the findings of the 2001 Roberts Review <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> and the 2010 Hodge Review <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, which both recommended the inclusion of skills training within doctoral education, with a particular emphasis on transferable skills. From 2014 to 2019 CHASE employed its Cohort Development Fund<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  to initiate training programmes in three broad areas: Advanced Research Craft, Future Humanities and Public Humanities. Each year, a competitive bidding process allocated funding to both staff- and student-led training programmes, leading to the development of a number of initiatives. Once funding had been allocated and a programme established, students were invited to apply for training places. During Phase 1 of the DTP, priority was given to students in receipt of a CHASE studentship, while other PhD students at CHASE institutions were usually allowed to apply if sufficient places were available.</p>
<p>Digital humanities was immediately identified as a priority area and regarded as an essential element in the training opportunities offered to CHASE students. During this period, the CHASE institutions displayed varying degrees of involvement with digital humanities, ranging from the foundation of a multimillion-pound centre (the Sussex Humanities Lab, launched in 2015), to the appointment of individual digital humanities staff (Open University, East Anglia, Essex, Kent), to research and teaching events on specific sections of DH or adjacent areas (such as Digital Media at Goldsmiths, Digital Literary Studies at Birkbeck, Digital Art History at the Courtauld). In none was digital humanities an established part of formal undergraduate or postgraduate curriculum, though more informal training opportunities were developed during the life of the consortium. While making it difficult for any single institution to sustain a digital humanities training programme on its own, the diversity of approaches and expertise present within CHASE had the potential to provide a rich and diverse corpus of teachers.</p>
<p>This article introduces a new model of DH pedagogy (the DEAR model) and uses the example of the CHASE Arts and Humanities in the Digital Age (AHDA) programme in the context of the UK DTP framework. The AHDA programme was launched in 2015 by an interdisciplinary team led by The Open University and the University of East Anglia. It was allocated £15,000-£20,000 per annum by the CHASE Training and Development fund to cover staff and student travel, seminar organisation and a certain amount of staff time, with additional staff time provided as an in-kind contribution. It concluded with the end of the first phase of CHASE in Summer 2019, after having trained over one hundred students.</p>
<p>There have been previous approaches to training provision in digital humanities for research students. The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funded an initiative for doctoral students in the UK called Collaborative Digital Research in the Humanities (CEDAR) (2008-2010). It had three main aims:</p>
<p>to further the understanding and expertise of doctoral students in the humanities in the use of hypermedia and other digital humanities research tools;   to bring together humanities doctoral students in a way that will ensure current and future peer-led development in this area;  to offer examples of good practice and innovation in the use of new technologies in the humanities <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>CEDAR was a bold first step in the UK at creating inter-institutional training for doctoral students on the eve of the creation of the Doctoral Training Partnerships. However, the focus at that time was largely around how digital technology was changing the ways that academics worked by sharing and modifying content. The depth of understanding around the nature of data in the humanities, and the value of quantitative and qualitative research methods, was at the time very limited. Similarly, the Praxis Network project provides a snapshot from 2017 of eight postgraduate-level programmes in digital humanities at institutions in the UK, US, and New Zealand. The project aims to  “emphasize new models of methodological training and collaborative research”   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> in the digital humanities. However, digital humanities programmes are still relatively uncommon in the UK, and none has explicitly addressed how the various motivations and expectations of participants shape the extent of their desired participation in digital humanities as a community of practice.</p>
<p>We will therefore consider how DH training might be embedded within a student’s broader learning journey with reference to the CHASE AHDA programme. First, we will analyse how self-determined learning and working within a community of practice combine in DH pedagogy to support heutagogical learning in DH. Second, we will define digital humanities pedagogy in the context of postgraduate researcher training. Third, we will introduce our model, the DEAR model, based on abstracted principles from the applied pedagogy that could be adapted to account for locally informed pedagogical practice. These principles are: Diversity; Employability; Application; and Reflection. Fourth, we will demonstrate and evaluate how we have instantiated the DEAR model into the CHASE Arts and Humanities in the Digital Age (AHDA) training programme. In doing so, this paper will make a significant contribution to our understanding of pedagogical practices for doctoral-level DH training by reflecting on how the DEAR model can be adapted to other contexts, and provide a set of recommendations for doing so.</p>
<h2 id="learning-in-a-community-of-practice">Learning in a Community of Practice</h2>
<p>The introduction of the DTP2 funding round (2019-2024) is changing the funding context, making this an opportune moment to reflect upon DTP1. We therefore aimed to provide a snapshot of the UK digital humanities provision at a time that coincided with the end of the DTP1 five-year funding cycle. In June 2019, we surveyed data from FindaMasters and FindaPhD, two of the most commonly used search websites for postgraduate programmes. The syllabi of these MAs/PhDs were not examined, meaning that this data refers only to programmes that explicitly mention DH. Of 350 advertised MA programmes, eleven could be identified as digital humanities. Of twenty PhD studentships, only one mentioned both digital and humanities. It is worth noting that most PhD scholarships are advertised in the period October-December, so we conducted our survey during a time when fewer opportunities would be on offer. However, even this survey suggests that digital humanities are not explicitly mentioned in the majority of the programmes listed in the most widely used MA/PhD search websites. Our brief analysis also flagged up different terminologies, levels of self-identification and organisational alignment with digital humanities, coupled with conflicting definitions of the field.</p>
<p>Another significant result of our survey was the geographical distribution of these programmes. Of the eleven MAs advertised, eight were based in London, with the rest of the country, especially England, being severely underrepresented (one course was offered in Scotland and one in Wales). Only four of the eleven DTPs were included in the offer of MA and PhD programmes in DH. Overall, this suggests that DH is rarely the main focus of postgraduate learning in the United Kingdom. As a result, it is important to reflect upon the challenge of providing DH training in a multidisciplinary environment where students’ primary focus is at the subject level. Whether English Language and Literature, History, or Art and Design, many students ground their training needs first and foremost within their own disciplinary context. It is therefore important to their development to understand how disciplinarity has been addressed within the digital humanities.</p>
<h2 id="intermultidisciplinary">Inter/multidisciplinary</h2>
<p>To take into account the broad disciplinary perspectives of our students, we have sought not to centre our pedagogical approach on a strict definition of the digital humanities. In this we take our lead from scholars such as Lisa Spiro, who describes the digital humanities as a  “convergence of several sets of values, including those of the humanities; libraries, museums and cultural heritage organizations; and networked culture”   <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. All of these groups have been represented in the CHASE AHDA programme, and each faces the challenge of defining how their established practices relate to the inter- and multi-disciplinary communities that constitute DH. In 2011, Matthew Jockers and Glenn Worthey coined the highly influential concept of the Big Tent to express the diversity of DH practices, noting their  “wonder and appreciation for the many-splendored field of DH”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> in a move that was designed to be highly inclusionary and participatory. Simultaneously joyful and pragmatic <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, the big tent also had the unintended effect of erasing the multifarious disciplinary traditions – effectively grouping everybody into a single amorphous space which, by erasing the barriers between disciplines, in fact worked to ensure that traditionally powerful scholarly traditions dominated the conversation. <a href="#klein1990">Klein (1990)</a> has noted that interdisciplinarity relies on some form of demarcation between the disciplines in question, and the push back against the unintended erasure of smaller disciplinary traditions via the big tent has been characterised by a similar logic.</p>
<p>Klein, while recognising the broad scope and significance of interdisciplinarity, notes that cutting across all the various theories is one recurring idea: that it  “is a means of solving problems and answering questions that cannot be satisfactorily addressed using single methods or approaches”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. The extent to which the digital humanities truly engage with various disciplines has been contested <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, and indeed attention has fallen in recent years upon how it represents and exchanges knowledge with other meta-disciplines such as Library and Information Studies <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This view follows on from McCarty and Short’s work to map the extent of humanities computing, the forerunner term to digital humanities. Their work resulted in the creation of a  “methodological commons”  which presented DH as a series of convergence points between the various disciplines, and focusing upon methods and tools that were considered essential to the DH community <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. The nature of this collaboration, or this community of practice, in DH has been heavily discussed over the years. Several models have been introduced, which expand upon or provide alternatives to Melissa Terras’ notation of the concept of communities of practice <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Terras considered whether or not digital humanities (as we now understand it) was actually a discipline or a community of practice. The former has a more institutionalised presence as well as an international community; the latter, a group  “which shares theories of meaning and power, collectivity and subjectivity&hellip; but is little more than a support network for academic scholars who use outlier methods in their own individual fields”   <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Terras’ conclusion is that digital humanities seems to act like a discipline, but without the institutional acceptance of a subject:  “&hellip;the community exists, and functions, and has found a way to continue disseminating its knowledge and encouraging others into the community without the institutionalization of the subject”   <sup id="fnref2:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This desire to encourage others to participate effectively in DH has led to a great deal of work in relation to the nature of these communities of practice. In his influential account, Ray Siemens ruminates on the careful balance that must be found between preserving an element of disciplinarity, on the one hand, and adopting a more revolutionary approach to DH:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we do try to define in a way that can lead to action&hellip;there’s a loss via disciplinarity’s constraint in light of current and future growth, narrowing potential collaborative opportunities… Conversely, we can choose to ignore disciplinary and institutional structures, adopting the revolutionary approach we find reflected in the several excellent manifestos existing in the area… but, in ignoring those structures, we run the risk of losing access to their benefits.<br>
<sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Siemens, however, focuses upon the collective nature of this relationship, arguing that this community contains people who have  “identified”   <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> with the community of practice. The notable and admirable focus on collectivism here, then, begins to build a definition for DH of those who are a self-selecting part of the recognised DH community. Within this context, Siemens’ repeated discussion of the term we -  “who we are via what it is we do, where we do what we do, and why we do it in the way that we do it”   <sup id="fnref3:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> becomes a carefully constrained collective that may even have limited relevance to those who do not want to identify with the DH community. Yet, as we have found through our training programme, the non-identifying DHer represents a significant proportion of those reaching out for relevant training. Thus it is essential for us to consider how other models – of DH, of pedagogy, and of learning – might support such learners to engage with critical digital humanities practices in a meaningful way, by which we mean in a way that can be successfully operationalised in the individual’s own work.</p>

<p>Svensson borrows the notion of  “trading zones”  to describe  “places where interdisciplinary work occurs and where different traditions are maintained at the same time as intersectional work is carried out”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. He argues that the digital humanities can become an intersectional meeting place where scholars can maximise points of interaction and facilitate deep praxis-led interactions. However, as <a href="#terras2006">Terras (2006)</a> notes, we are still talking here primarily about a research environment rather than a learning environment. What we are often doing, then, is encouraging students to enter the DH space through meta-debates that are focused upon effective research rather than effective learning. Indeed, Claire Warwick has challenged the orthodoxy assuming that a single form of DH will emerge that encompasses all relevant parties, noting  “the likelihood that different schools and methods of doing DH will emerge”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. What, however, is most relevant to the discussion of research training is that despite their importance to the field of DH, meta-debates are not obvious to newcomers, and are indeed not often relevant. Instead, we have found through the CHASE AHDA programme that the key sticking point for many participants is working out how to operationalise new forms of intellectual and technical practice into their existing humanistic modes of study. As such, the otherwise essential work on communities of practice emphasises characteristics of collectivism in DH research that are to some extent incompatible with the more self-directed individual learning journey that many new entrants to DH embark upon.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary learning, though, offers a degree of guidance in navigating this tension between the community and the individual learner. Indeed, we will argue that groupwork is essential within this individual learning journey in order to expose learners to other disciplinary perspectives, and is a key facet of learning in this context. Klein’s notions of the pedagogy of interdisciplinarity, for instance, share an intellectual core with the structure of the CHASE AHDA program. For instance, she notes that both DH and interdisciplinary learning are  “active and dynamic. Group work and projects are common and, echoing the constructivist theory of learning, students build new knowledge through exploration and the actual  doing  of a subject”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Many existing training programmes emphasise and reinforce the idea that there is a core set of competencies and methods that are central to DH. This is a matter of necessity, but one great strength of the collaborative doctoral training system in the United Kingdom is that it encourages interdisciplinary and collective solutions from staff that support individual learning from learners.</p>
<h2 id="digital-humanities-and-self-determined-learning">Digital Humanities and Self-Determined Learning</h2>
<p>Many of our students on CHASE AHDA have been more focused on their individual learning journey. Indeed, the programme has welcomed the full spectrum of attendees from those who intend to pursue DH-related careers, to those with an interest in learning more about the field, through to those who are solely interested in how to operationalise and understand specific DH competencies in their own work. This means that individuals must learn about the methods and tools that are available to them, how they individually relate to DH, and how that influences their own learning. We turn here to the literature on self-determined learning to propose that it must sit alongside community-driven active learning in order to maximise the benefits to participants from diverse backgrounds. Our model for CHASE AHDA thus emphasises two key points: self-determined, reflective learning, and scaffolding of sessions via active learning and groupwork. As we will outline here, this allows learners to create their own learning communities, not as spaces for research practice, but as networks to facilitate and support their own individual learning approaches. To this end, the concept of heutagogical learning has been largely underexplored in relation to DH pedagogy.</p>
<p>The term heutagogy was introduced by <a href="#hase2000">Stewart Hase and Chris Kenyon (2000)</a> to represent the study of self-determined learning. They draw upon Knowles’ definition of self-directed learning as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process in which individuals take the initiative, with or without the help of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes .<br>
<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Importantly, though, they view heutagogy as a less linear, and more intuitive and unplanned process. Hase and Kenyon emphasise that heutagogical learning emphasizes flexibility, in that the teacher provides resources but the learner designs their own course and, if appropriate, the assessment <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. A heutagogically-centred approach for DH, then, relies upon the ability of learners to access resources with relevance to their own learning, and to develop their own journey through the material in a way that helps them to define and obtain their own desired outcomes. While structured workshops play a vital role in imparting often highly technical information to learners, and do so within the CHASE AHDA programme, it suddenly becomes hugely important to provide a highly reflective space that allows learners time to consider these aspects of their learning. The question of reflection has been under-investigated but not ignored in DH pedagogy. Mahony et al. provide a valuable account of the role of reflection in Masters’ study, for example <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. The focus and value here is around doctoral learning, which should address higher-order thinking, and ultimately support an original contribution to knowledge, a key tenet of research degree programmes in the UK, and arguably worldwide <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. Heutagogy, within this context, represents a shift towards the learner that facilitates such a reflective turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a subsequent article, Hase noted that heutagogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>suggests that learning is an extremely complex process that occurs within the learner, is unobserved and is not tied in some magical way to the curriculum. Learning is associated with making new linkages in the brain involving ideas, emotions, and experiences that lead to new understandings about self or the world.<br>
<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> While much of the heutagogical literature refers to online learning, it is characterised by several aspects that provide a useful framework for student-led learning in DH: self-determined learning, in which individuals take the initiative to diagnose their learning needs and engage with resources in a way that leads to new understandings <sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>; group collaboration, via active learning and creation <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>; and a reflective approach to identifying and evaluating learners’ own learning outcomes. These all provide a useful pivot point that aligns the approach of the CHASE AHDA programme more closely with those models of DH that emphasise not only communities of practice that have been discussed here, but the ways in which diverse individual and disciplinary backgrounds inform how participants approach their learning in DH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, while DH emphases the collaborative, the interdisciplinary, and the community-driven aspects of its praxis, its training is often centred on a self-determined journey of discovery. Stories abound of the autodidact in DH, the individual who was forced to teach themselves due to a lack of external training. There is an element of necessity in this – while many aspects of method, approach, even theory, can transfer across the disciplines that represent the DH community of practice, a new entrant is faced with the challenging prospect of working out how to apply these myriad contexts to their own work. It is therefore essential for them to be given the space to reflect upon their own journey, to adopt a heutagogic approach to their learning that helps them to shape and decide their level of engagement with the research-focused community of practice that sits a step beyond the methodological commons of DH practice situated within various disciplines.</p>
<p>Yet, as DH training becomes an ever-more embedded, but sadly under-theorised, area of focus for the community, the question of how to balance the needs at the various points of the learner spectrum becomes a highly pressing concern. As the following section will indicate, the framework outlined here gives us a structure upon which we, as professionals with DH-related positions, might leverage our broader understanding of the field in a way that promotes the self-determined model of learning that is necessary to support a diverse body of learners.</p>
<h2 id="digital-humanities-pedagogy-in-the-context-of-postgraduate-researcher-training">Digital Humanities pedagogy in the context of postgraduate researcher training.</h2>
<p>In addition to the tension between collectivism and individual direction in research practice, there is a further layer of complexity as this takes place within specific higher education structures. The increased formal presence of DH in universities and DTPs has an influence on who attends certain training programmes. Where there is a strong local presence of DH, students are likely to use that provision first, as opposed to a cross-institutional programme provided by the DTP.</p>
<p>A digital humanities pedagogy for research training therefore needs to be mindful of the quasi-disciplinary community it speaks to and the ability of students to apply skills and behaviours locally within their own institution. This will depend on the degree to which DH has been embedded alongside the other fundamentals of their discipline. One of the dimensions that has been crucial in the DTP training context is employability. For example, the CHASE DTP currently provides students with the opportunity to undertake a three-month paid internship with a partner organisations in the GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) sector <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. As a result, students are coming to programmes such as the CHASE AHDA with objectives that include enhancing future employment prospects <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The primarily US-oriented literature has addressed such learner motivations. <a href="#bonds2014">Leigh Bonds (2014)</a>, for instance, has written on the preparation and delivery of undergraduate courses that include both the employability dimension, which is also a feature of researcher development, and  “project-based learning;”  an approach relevant to our model of training. <a href="#konkol2015">Margaret Konkol (2015)</a>, however, has highlighted some of the inherent assumptions around learning and research outputs around digital humanities in US institutions (and arguably those in the UK as well). The difference that Konkol identifies is the apparent distinction between the two terms: digital humanities and digital pedagogy, in which the latter is  “classified as the light and lively little sister whose ability to use digital tools in the classroom engages students in a variety of interactive learning formats”   <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Konkol’s digital pedagogy resembles digital literacies in the UK (<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>); functional skills aimed at employability which can be readily embedded in undergraduate programmes, with defined learning outcomes. However, research activities that may receive more substantial funding tend to sit apart from learning and teaching conceptually. The real academic work is assumed to take place within such projects.</p>
<p>In many ways, universities and digital humanities teachers can draw on a digital literacy framework in the UK to structure their approach, but the functional skills, such as learning Python syntax to extract textual data from different source files (ICT literacy), are not in isolation training in digital humanities.</p>
<p>Digital literacies are defined by JISC as  “those capabilities which fit an individual for living, learning and working in a digital society”   <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Although frequently considered in relation to undergraduate and Masters programmes, which are highly structured through taught programmes, they are clearly applicable to researchers, and particularly those whose work focuses on or utilises digital resources.</p>

<p>The challenge for those in the UK who support doctoral researchers is to develop these digital literacies across a range of disciplines and fields at a research level, rather than embed them in undergraduate programmes.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that the pedagogy around digital literacies is so challenging is that it contains seven elements that work as part of a longer developmental process, and one which is seen as very much bound up with the student’s own identity <sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Research training as a whole can be seen as remedial, with digital literacies becoming part of a deficit model in higher education <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>, the aim being to embed functional skills to enable the student to complete their research in a timely fashion, and hence reduce risks around non-completion and low employability. This has been a particular concern in doctoral education in the US in recent years <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Konkol’s point here is that this distinction is false. Digital humanities work entails learning, (few researchers begin research fully-equipped to undertake it) and students can learn through involvement in and contribution to real-world projects: this is how a digital humanities pedagogy is applied. In short, and in the applied context of research training, we have taken digital humanities pedagogy to mean digital humanities combined with digital pedagogy.</p>
<h2 id="core-elements-of-a-digital-humanities-pedagogy">Core Elements of a Digital Humanities Pedagogy</h2>
<p>Reviewing the last decade of digital literacies and digital humanities pedagogy, it is clear that researcher developers need to look broadly at the context of the modern doctorate, the design of undergraduate teaching using project-based learning, digital literacies, employability, and the nature of digital humanities as a community of practice to inform the structure of formal programmes. The CEDAR programme mentioned earlier focused primarily on digital literacies, whereas there is a need for a model that encompasses the complexity of postgraduate researcher training. CEDAR encountered challenges around the diversity of backgrounds of students, which reflects Taylor, Kiley and Humphrey’s <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> observation about the present diversity of the doctoral candidate population worldwide.</p>
<p>In drawing together these phenomena at research degree level, we can discern several core principles:</p>
<p>Programme design should embrace diversity of candidates’ a) disciplinary backgrounds and b) technical proficiencies  Learning outcomes should reflect candidates’ priorities around employability, in terms of transferable ICT skills and disciplinary expertise  Learning should emphasise application and preferably involve the design, execution and evaluation of a project  Learning should emphasise reflection on a) individual abilities and b) attitudes and behaviours towards others in the digital humanities community</p>
<p>We can visualise these principles as core elements to underpin learning and teaching, which we present in <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a> as the DEAR model:</p>

     ><figcaption>
        <p>The DEAR model
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Although there are clear challenges to embedding each of these elements, they should function and be taught interdependently. For example, significant differences in technical proficiencies (diversity) can be supported and improved through initial reflection by candidates on their current abilities and aspirations (employability), as well as the nature of the application; most projects do not rely on all team members having the same skill sets, nor do individual projects require an individual to have a high level of proficiency in all skills.  <em>The skills and competencies need to match the aims of the project</em> . This is true of any doctoral research; digital humanities projects are no exception.</p>
<p>In the following section we will consider how this self-determined approach to learning and engagement with a community of practice supports a digital humanities pedagogy. We will do so with reference to the CHASE AHDA programme, which embodies many aspects of the pedagogical DEAR model proposed here.</p>
<h2 id="the-chase-ahda-programme">The CHASE AHDA programme</h2>
<p>This section demonstrates and evaluates how the principles of the DEAR model were instantiated in the CHASE AHDA programme. The programme was enabled by a yearly grant from the CHASE Training and Development Group, which was allocated each year during the period 2014-2019 through a competitive bidding process. The grant covered staff travel and subsistence while teaching on the programme, catering for staff and students and honoraria for a small number of external speakers. Staff time and room use were provided as an in-kind contribution from CHASE member institutions. No charge was levied for enrolling in the programme, but students were responsible for their own travel costs, except for overnight accommodation at residential workshops, which was covered by the yearly grant. Students who received their doctoral scholarship from CHASE had access to a £1,000 individual research allowance, which they could employ to travel to the course workshops.</p>
<p>The first iteration of AHDA in 2014/15 experimented with a multi-site approach based on independently-held seminars on a number of Digital Humanities subjects, which experienced quite variable levels of attendance. While each seminar provided in-depth training on a given area, the CHASE Training and Development Group remarked upon the lack of a unifying vision for the programme. In order to address these issues, the core AHDA team, led by Francesca Benatti (Open University), Matthew Sillence (University of East Anglia) and Paul Gooding (then University of East Anglia) decided from 2015/16 to provide a more directed programme delivered in one centralised and easily accessible location, The Open University in London regional office. After Paul Gooding’s move to the University of Glasgow, David King (Open University) joined the core AHDA team for the 2018/19 academic year.</p>
<p>The emphasis of the revised programme was to provide a more coherent structure with clearly defined outcomes in terms of employability skills, allowing space for the application of DH research skills within a short project. At the same time, students would be invited to reflect upon their degree of participation in the digital humanities community, taking into account the diversity of their backgrounds and goals. The structure of the course was therefore revised and rebuilt around</p>
<ul>
<li>a three-day residential winter school (December or January)</li>
<li>four one-day methods-based workshops (January - April)</li>
<li>a two-day mid-project residential (March)</li>
<li>a final plenary session (April or May)</li>
</ul>
<p>Below we assess how the programme employed the DEAR pedagogical model to achieve its outcomes within the remit provided by the CHASE DTP.</p>
<h2 id="winter-school">Winter School</h2>
<p>The 2014/15 iteration of the AHDA programme had shown the promise and challenges of digital humanities training. Following informal consultations in 2015 with Digital Humanities colleagues and with the CHASE Training and Development Group, it was decided to open all following presentations of AHDA with a three-day residential Winter School, which took place in December or January. The aim of this intensive residential opening was to enable the students to reflect upon their prior knowledge of Digital Humanities and their expectations for the course. In addition, a venue was provided for students to begin to consider their desired degree of participation in the digital humanities community. A public blog was maintained for each year, providing information on programme details, booking links, and access to learning materials<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> . Over its four iterations, the Winter School was attended by fifteen to twenty-five students each year, with numbers capped at twenty students per programme from 2017/18 onwards. The event consisted of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a plenary lecture by leading CHASE Digital Humanities scholars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a number of introductory 2-hour seminars from the AHDA core team and from the teachers of the subsequent workshops, including</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digitisation and metadata</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data visualisation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Threshold concepts as a critical learning framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a final student-led unconference focusing on the practical group project that would form the main application of their learning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The residential school format has widespread precedents in Digital Humanities pedagogy, such as for example the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI)<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  and the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School (DH@OxSS)<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> . For the AHDA programme, it was found to offer considerable benefits but also some significant disadvantages, due to the diversity of the student population. An intensive, face-to-face experience allowed the students to participate in a more in-depth introduction to the variety of Digital Humanities approaches. Additionally, it permitted students from different universities and departments to develop connections based on common or contiguous interests, building a sense of membership in a shared student cohort. Finally, it was central to the definition and allocation of group projects, which formed a central part of the application of the students’ learning.</p>
<p>The four iterations of the Winter School confirmed the validity of this approach but also highlighted its exclusionary impact on certain categories of students, with the potential to negatively affect student diversity. Specifically, students with disabilities, caring duties or additional commitments (for example, those undertaking part-time study) were found to experience difficulties in attending the Winter School or in committing to its full duration. Mitigation strategies were gradually put in place and included the prior circulation of teaching materials and handouts, culminating finally in the video capture of the directed teaching component of the School from 2017/18 onwards. However, the seminar-style discussions and group-based exercises could not be captured for data protection reasons.</p>
<p>Contents were pitched at an introductory level, assuming no prior familiarity with Digital Humanities methodologies and debates. The diversity of the student cohorts was the main reason for this choice. While CHASE is a specialist Art and Humanities partnership, student backgrounds were nonetheless quite disparate, including a range of subjects such as digital humanities, musicology, practical digital arts, social sciences, literature, art history, history, visual arts/visual anthropology and media studies. <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a> groups them on the basis of the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) Units of Assessment<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> .</p>

<p>Though a growing number of students joined AHDA because of an interest in digital media and culture, over the five iterations students presented with variable levels of digital skills, ranging from programming to video editing to basic digital literacy skills. Rather than force the more novice students to catch up on their own, the Winter School was designed to develop a common basis through intensive training. Topics discussed included what were labelled  “the building blocks of Digital Humanities:”  digitisation and metadata, basic text analysis and web authoring. All topics were taught in two-hours sessions, which included both a lecture and a practical applied component through in-class exercises. The exercises, carried out in small groups, offered a first chance for students of different prior skill levels to enter into a dialogue and begin to collaborate.</p>
<p>Transferable skills for employability were further developed with the introduction of a session on project management from 2017/2018 onwards. According to a recent report, unlike their colleagues in STEM, UK Arts and Humanities PhD students are less likely to be motivated to undertake doctoral study by the opportunity to develop transferable skills <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>, despite the fact that roughly 75% of those who move into non-academic careers undertake non-research roles <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. The CHASE AHDA team therefore viewed it as essential to introduce students to the skills that could be mapped to Domains C and D of the Vitae Researcher Development Framework, especially around Research Management (C2) and Working with Others (D1) (see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>). A half-day project management workshop was delivered in collaboration with the British Library, one of the CHASE non-academic partner institutions, and by CHASE team members with project management expertise. In 2019, we also partnered with the Royal Society, the School of Advanced Studies, and digital consultancy company Digirati to provide a workshop to evaluate the Science in the Making platform, where students worked alongside cross-sectoral partners to support further development of the user interface and functionality of the resource.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup></p>
<p>A significant reflective element was provided by a session on threshold concepts, which asked the students to consider the motivations and modalities of their learning journey <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Through threshold concepts, students were asked to examine the process of learning, focusing on their expectations of transformative and integrative enhancement to their education through their participation in AHDA <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. The decision to include this component was led by research showing the benefit of aiding students in the development of an explicit conceptual framework to support doctoral learning <sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. At the Winter School, students were asked to define their research problems and to organise their research design for the upcoming group or individual project, with further assessments of their implementation and their conceptual conclusions in the middle and at the end of the entire AHDA programme. They were also asked to situate their participation in AHDA within their broader learning and career goals.</p>
<p>The Winter School was designed to allow the students to combine an individual learning journey with taking the first steps into a digital humanities community of practice. After the 2016/17 academic year, teacher-led plenary sessions were replaced with presentations from AHDA alumni who evaluated the programme and its impact on their employability, for example by enabling them to join Digital Humanities projects as interns or team members. This heutagogical approach culminated in a one-day student-led unconference, during which students were asked to propose a research project, usually focused on their own research interests, and to pitch it to their fellow students. Votes were then cast to choose which four projects would be developed during the remainder of the AHDA course, with students choosing which project group to join. AHDA team members then provided the students with advice on methodologies and resources for their projects.</p>
<p>While this process enabled students with more developed plans for their learning journey to expand them through the help of their peers, feedback collected over the first three iterations led to the introduction of individual projects. The latter were found to enable greater dialogue between the interdisciplinarity of Digital Humanities methods and the diversity of the students’ disciplinary backgrounds and interests. This grounding in the students’ own priorities helped them to remain motivated for the duration of the programme and to assess the relevance of their learning to their future employability. The initial presentation and the subsequent iterative refinement of the project ideas through peer and teacher feedback were retained even with the individual projects approach.</p>
<h2 id="follow-on-workshops">Follow-on workshops</h2>
<p>After the Winter School, students had further opportunities to self-direct the course of their learning. Between 2015/16 and 2017/18, students were able to choose between two and four one-day workshops, held face-to-face over the course of three months (January to April). The syllabus as initially proposed aspired to provide an overview of the main areas of Digital Humanities research as as reflected in the expertise present within scholars from CHASE and the British Library, who delivered workshops on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text Analysis for History and Literature</li>
<li>Digital Images and Digital Art History</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Information Visualisation</li>
</ul>
<p>While the topics above were appreciated by the students, they were not equally relevant to all of the students’ diverse disciplinary backgrounds and to all of their employability goals. This element of self-direction led to an excessive dispersion of a small student cohort, with certain seminars being poorly attended. More broadly, it reduced the development of a common grounding in digital humanities methods and perspectives.</p>
<p>The emphasis of the AHDA programme shifted gradually from teaching discrete topics into preparing the students for employability as digital researchers either as individuals or as part of a group. The 2018/19 programme focused therefore on guiding the students through the development of their own research project, providing workshops on the following interdisciplinary skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data cleaning and management</li>
<li>Introduction to Python</li>
<li>Network Analysis</li>
<li>Information Visualisation</li>
</ul>
<p>Each workshop included a taught element, presented by a subject specialist, and a practical afternoon session, where students applied what they had learnt to their individual projects and data. This hands-on session enabled students to ask and receive advice from the AHDA team, who were also available outside of the workshops through virtual office hours. The diversity of the student cohort resulted in all students being able to make contributions to the discussions and exercises on the basis of their disciplinary and personal background, such as having experience of working in cultural institutions, being skilled in a programming language, or being familiar with certain media types.</p>
<h2 id="mid-project-residential">Mid-project residential</h2>
<p>Another residential event was organised midway through the AHDA programme, usually in early March. Students and the AHDA team met for two days to</p>
<ul>
<li>report on project progress in 10-minute individual or group presentations</li>
<li>receive feedback and feed forward advice from instructors and peers</li>
<li>develop transferable skills in web authoring and dissemination</li>
</ul>
<p>The mid-project residential allowed students from different institutions to meet face-to-face and to reflect on the progress of their group project, receiving further feedback from teachers and peers. After the shift to individual projects, the focus of this second residential moved to short presentations on ongoing progress and challenges, and on the provision of  “feed forward”  advice, helping the students to plan the next steps in their research <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>. For both group and individual projects, the second residential had the aim of increasing the opportunities for cohort-building and collegiality among students and teachers. It also helped to reinforce important employability skills, such as communication (through presentations on the progress of their project), critical thinking (by providing feed forward on other students’ work) and problem solving (by sharing suggestions for development with the other students). Finally, it provided additional opportunities for reflection and evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="final-presentation">Final presentation</h2>
<p>The concluding learning event took place in late April and consisted of presentations on the group (or individual) projects, discussions on the projects and an extended feedback session where students expressed their views on the entire AHDA programme. Sample group projects included mapping medieval miracles, visualising Early Modern printing networks and building a survey and database of favourite songs. Individual projects included performing text analysis on mailing lists and forums, classifying music reviews, visualising the social networks behind a museum collection, analysing the language of newspaper articles and of official reports, and building a language corpus.</p>
<p>In the student presentations and discussion, emphasis was placed on process and reflection, rather than on notions of success and completion. Reconnecting to the threshold concepts session at the Winter School, students were asked to reflect on their research journey, highlighting both milestones and difficulties. The importance of careful project planning, of documenting each step of the research process, and of a clear division of tasks within a team were among the most frequent items to emerge from this reflection phase. Students were also encouraged to consider the applicability of what they had learned within their doctoral research and their envisaged future employment opportunities. Several students, for example, declared the intention to include their AHDA project as part of seminar presentations, articles and dissertations, or to further their participation in the digital humanities community through, for example, further involvement in DH initiatives such as summer schools or DH seminars and centres in their home institutions.</p>
<p>The AHDA feedback sessions provided the team with essential information to develop and adjust the programme over the years in order to better understand the training needs of the students and respond to them. For example, the shift from group to individual projects was motivated by consistent student feedback, which highlighted the shortcomings of the group approach. Collaboration is a central tenet of digital humanities, which is often manifested in multi-disciplinary project teams and programmes. However, the constraints of the AHDA programme made effective groupwork difficult. Students were based in different institutions, often separated by significant geographical distances. Moreover, they were often at different points in their doctoral student journeys, ranging from first year to thesis submission. Hence, the other demands on their time varied considerably. Finally, they had different levels of commitment to the projects, especially where the fit with their disciplinary background was poorer, and different degrees of participation in the digital humanities community.</p>
<p>In order to recognise this diversity within the student cohort, the AHDA team agreed therefore to move to individual projects, refocusing the group work objective through the feed forward and feedback sessions in the mid-project and final workshops. The team were impressed by the students’ development of informal support networks, for example through a WhatsApp group, and their engagement in independent exchanges of expertise, resources and advice. The vast majority of the goals of the previous group projects were therefore fulfilled through a self-determined asynchronous contact strategy.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-evaluating-the-dear-model-in-ahda">Conclusion: Evaluating the DEAR Model in AHDA</h2>
<p>This article has used the CHASE AHDA programme as a case study to consider how DH training might be embedded within a student’s broader learning journey. We have analysed the roles of self-determined learning within DH communities of practice, and defined digital humanities pedagogy in the context of postgraduate researcher training. Based on this critical framework, we have introduced the DEAR model for DH learning and teaching, based on four abstracted principles that can be adapted to account for locally informed pedagogical practice: Diversity; Employability; Application; and Reflection. Finally, we have evaluated how we have instantiated the DEAR model into the CHASE AHDA training programme. This conclusion provides a set of reflections upon the extent to which DEAR has been successfully implemented in our programme, and recommends key priorities for those looking to adopt it in their own pedagogical practices. In doing so, it demonstrates the potential for DEAR to act as an adaptable framework upon which to shape local multidisciplinary training in digital humanities.</p>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<p>The AHDA programme has certainly embraced the diversity of its candidates, originally in attempting to address the disciplinary interests through historical and literary texts, social media, social and economic data and visual and aural media. Although this may reflect the disciplinary demographics of postgraduate research in DTPs such as CHASE, it proved difficult to anticipate each year, and therefore more challenging to cover with our teaching staff.</p>
<p>In terms of diversity in skills and competencies, AHDA has been able to establish an entry-level approach, which has clearly benefited the majority of postgraduate researchers in being accessible. This was, however, more problematic for students working on group projects. In these cases, students with pre-existing knowledge and higher proficiency in certain methods or techniques were more likely to adopt technical roles within their groups. This limited the opportunities for other members to develop comparable skills.</p>
<p>Diversity has much deeper historical, social and political implications. Digital Humanities as a community of practice may be inclusive in aims, but clearly can do more to decolonise its curriculum, as shown through the work of groups such as Postcolonial DH and Global Outlook::Digital Humanities.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  Possible avenues include addressing the gaps in the digital archives, using digital methods to represent marginalised voices, embracing plurality and using the digital to question dominant narratives <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. The CHASE DTP overall is addressing diversity issues through, for example, the BAME Masterclass series<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> , the Feminist Duration<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  lecture series, the CHASE Feminist Network<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  and public lectures such as Decolonising the Nuclear.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  A specifically feminist approach to Digital Humanities was introduced with the 2020 FACT///.coding workshop series, which partnered with Women Who Code London and the Reanimating Data Project.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p>
<p>Writing this in an ongoing pandemic, the question of remote attendance is at the forefront of everyone’s mind, but virtual or mixed seminars are a possibility for widening participation regardless of wider issues. They offer the opportunity to support diverse student needs, such as those who have personal or professional commitments that prevent them from taking part in residential programmes. This approach would have to be combined with a reevaluation of the programme’s goals and structure.</p>
<h2 id="employability">Employability</h2>
<p>Many candidates on the AHDA programme were motivated by their own projects, i.e. the PhD itself. The initial focus on group projects was intended to reflect the collaborative nature of work in digital humanities, but this was not limited to preparedness for an academic career. The involvement of key partners from the UK GLAM sector was both a DTP strategic commitment, but also in recognition of the various career trajectories of doctoral candidates.</p>
<p>Where engagement with employability has been most successful is undoubtedly when representatives of the GLAM sector and project managers have been involved. These contributors have repeatedly highlighted the importance of institutional responsibilities, such as risk management, openness and scalability. Although candidates could use the AHDA experience as evidence of working with institutions beyond their immediate academic community, our programme did not focus on CV-building itself. We have also yet to measure the impact of AHDA on employability longer term. This would require a survey of the AHDA alumni to see if the training helped them in their careers, where opportunities in the academic community are still discipline-oriented. This in turn is heavily dependent on structural factors, such as the short-term funding provided by the DTP. Employability, therefore, is not the sole responsibility of this training, but needs to be part of broader initiatives in the UK addressing mentoring, skills and career diversity. One way forward may be the public scholarship model proposed by <a href="#cassuto2021">Cassuto and Weisbuch (2021)</a>, which involves academic knowledge and digital literacies, but also the professional attributes that are frequently deployed - but often implicit - in the GLAM sector <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. The question of employability is an ongoing debate in DH <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>, for which programmes such as AHDA provide important context.</p>
<h2 id="application">Application</h2>
<p>The heutagogical ethos of the AHDA programme meant that students needed to take individual responsibility for the design, execution and evaluation of a project. In group projects, although the first process involved investment from most group members, the remaining processes depended heavily on a group’s dynamic and its diversity.</p>
<p>Consistent motivation and evidencing of learning through design, execution and evaluation can be better defined and observed through individual projects. Their final stage is clearly complemented by an anonymous feed-forward approach, which allows for peer-learning in the absence of a team-based approach.</p>
<p>Application is therefore observed in two ways. The first is in furthering a student’s PhD research, the second is in making a wider contribution to knowledge, for example through partnerships with cultural heritage organisations, such as the British Library, or broadcast media. This is broadly in line with DTP support for partnerships and placements with CHASE partner institutions.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  Ultimately, this involves a movement from what both Nowviskie and Warwick describe as the unhelpful construct of hack versus yack, and towards a praxis-based model of digital humanities in theory and practice <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>A reflective approach to learning in the AHDA programme has been key to enabling the three other core elements of the DEAR model. A recognition of the challenges of the learning curve at the outset, and the need to effectively self-assess current skills and knowledge, has been crucial for addressing individual motivations and outcomes for both the project and for learning itself. In its most recent iteration, AHDA candidates’ mid-project and final presentations clearly demonstrated the technical skills acquired and extended abstract thinking <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. Specifically, the projects displayed the conceptual alignment of the ontological, methodological and epistemological dimensions of a research project; key characteristics of doctoral candidates <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Within the DEAR model, such reflection should take into account the other components of diversity, employability and application as encompassed within the students’ own learning journey. For example, the AHDA programme’s final reflective session is delivered as a group, which allows the diverse perspectives of attendees to feed in, while students are also tasked with addressing the development and learning outcomes of their project work, thus linking their reflection back to the application of digital humanities theory in practice. The iterative approach to reflection adopted in our programme (feed-forward and feedback) for students’ presentations also addressed the ways in which individuals identify their next steps, both for development of their own skills set and realisation of their project(s). These are fundamental aspects of professional development and employability generally, relating back to the RDF sub-domains B3 and C2 (see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>).</p>
<h2 id="recommendations-for-practice">Recommendations for Practice</h2>
<p>This article has conceptualised and applied the DEAR model within the context of the UK, demonstrating its success in developing a community of practice conducive to heutagogical learning within an advanced research training programme. However, the model has applicability for other contexts where a highly reflective, self-directed style of learning is suited locally to student needs, including doctoral training programmes internationally. The DEAR approach allows students the time and space to situate digital humanities within their own broader research skills development. As such, we see this as complementary to existing summer and winter schools, which are more focused upon skills development over a compressed time frame. Although we have cited examples of the projects that participants in AHDA have undertaken over the years, this study does not advocate adopting a predefined programme structure. It is the core elements of the DEAR model that are crucial to its success, such as providing time and space within the programme for the heutagogical aspects to be prioritised. Programme design should build out from these core principles, rather than inserting them once a programme is confirmed. For this reason, while team-taught models of DH training, including AHDA, may well use reflection, each of the instructors can benefit from building it in as an explicit value at the design stage.</p>
<p>As a result of running AHDA for several years, we recommend that those implementing the DEAR model pay particular attention to the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on participant projects and individual motivations, in order to scaffold learning and increase engagement with reflective components of the programme. This could be achieved through small group presentations about individual learning aims and, resources allowing, alternative pathways through the programme.</li>
<li>Encourage peer support for the learning around the project, rather than the execution of the project, using group feed-forward and feedback opportunities. For example, students can be encouraged to adopt communication platforms that best suit them, such as WhatsApp, which create a self-moderated back channel that facilitates heutagogical learning outcomes.</li>
<li>Ensure diversity of voices among trainers and support students in developing core knowledge around the nature of data and project management. One approach could be to involve individuals with expertise in project management and interdisciplinary collaboration, such as library, Alt-Ac and industry professionals in roles allied to digital humanities research and infrastructure.</li>
<li>Aim for inclusivity by providing recordings of workshops and preparatory reading materials and exercises. Organisers may want to use a project blog for public outputs or draw on existing local technical resources, such as a virtual learning environment (VLE), where materials cannot be made public. Online learning may also lower financial overheads, but may come with a potential trade-off in cohort development that comes with in-person learning.</li>
<li>The DEAR principles encourage trainers to develop learning environments that support active learning. This might require additional time commitment within the programme; if a course requires six hours of taught sessions, then an additional hour would allow for reflection on learning or application, for instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be considered that our implementation of the DEAR model was a non-credit-bearing programme, and relied on students and staff meeting several times over a period of four months. Residential programmes carry significant financial overheads, but in our case CHASE invested extensively in AHDA through the Training and Development fund, which may not be true of all programmes. One consideration for instructors is whether the programme is credit-bearing, a core requirement or extracurricular, which has implications for the availability of financial and administrative support. Scalability is also an issue, as we would argue that such an approach inevitably limits the number of participants. As organisers, we felt that a maximum of twenty to twenty-five students allowed for effective delivery of the programme aims and objectives.</p>
<p>If the resources for delivering a full training programme are unavailable, the DEAR model has value as a diagnostic, self-assessment tool in terms of learning design, which can be deployed for instructors who might be building separate course modules in a short programme or by postgraduate researchers and PhD students who need to scaffold their own self-determined learning in DH. Furthermore, it has potential to become a modular, adaptable framework whereby the four components are remixed to fit local learning priorities. In this sense it operates at both the level of the individual and the higher education institution.</p>
<p>Taking into account our findings, we argue that the DEAR model has great value for trainers working in a context where digital humanities skills are required. However to date the DEAR model has only been implemented within CHASE AHDA. We encourage other digital humanities instructors to adopt and adapt the DEAR model to their own educational contexts in order to test its application as a means of framing learning and teaching design within diverse digital humanities communities.</p>

<p>At 2.23 million, the inhabitants of US prisons and jails constitute a population larger than Houston’s and just behind Chicago’s — a larger population than sixteen American states.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  Nearly one quarter of the earth’s incarcerated human beings, and close to one third of the earth’s incarcerated women, are drawn from the less than 5% of people residing inside the US. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. A notoriously race-driven system, poor people of color live these numbers <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, while over 6,000-US confinement facilities, as well as the police, courtrooms and prisons stand virtual lightyears away from moneyed white living rooms where they appear as subjects of uncounted television dramas (and regular humor) <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. As long as incarcerated people remain either data points without faces or voices, or the criminal habitués of fearful popular imagination, they are easily dismissed as 2.23M units of a type, rather than being perceived as the nation’s fourth largest city of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren, wives and husbands.</p>
<p>The aim of this essay is to describe one instance of digital humanities practices working not only in contradistinction from  “retro-humanism”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> — the replication of traditional canons on line — but as an irruptive, discursive intervention into the dis-equalizing social practices from which retro-humanism might be counted as one distraction. It describes an instance in which DH’s signature ability to close spaces between people and archives seeks to close the  “social distance”  between those populations that determine criminal punishment and those upon whom punishments land, a distance that has been shown to mark nations where penal practice is most harsh <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. The essay will describe the organic emergence and growth of The American Prison Writing Archive, an archive of first-person non-fiction essays by incarcerated people that continues a 231-year history of American literary resistance to a dis-equalizing institution that over the past forty years has grown into the unprecedented American  “penal state”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. While the regular calls for DH to engage with inequality, social injustice, and cultural critique assume DH as an extant practice that needs to reassess its premises and methods <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> , this paper describes an instance of marginalized voices forcing a break out of prisons and into DH, and of their driving the metadata behind the search facets availed to archive visitors. Roopika Risam notes that  “Without attention to the omissions that exist within digital humanities scholarship, the field risks replicating the exclusions of a dominant culture that already relegates difference to its margins”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Here I describe a project that grew not from a decision to address such DH omissions but that evolved into the digital in the effort simply to keep up with the insistent will of those omitted by state confinement to press their case for inclusion in, and thus expansion of public discussion of US carceral practice. The APWA evolved from the labor of actors among the very populations that have historically been marginalized by criminal justice involvement — a testimonial action that, like other witness literatures, demands its own manner of reading. Amid debates surrounding traditional close and computation-enabled distant reading <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>, this essay documents the inception and rapid growth of a literary corpus that demands what I will describe as mid-range or cellular reading — a position that not only has a well-established history as a means of intervention in dis-equalizing social practices, but that is the apt response to what incarcerated writers do: write for 2.23 million others while making singular statements. The essay suggests that DH&rsquo;s definitive work of closing material distances is the work to which incarcerated and otherwise confined writers have always aspired: to broach walls (material, social, cultural, of prisons, plantations, death camps) and thus to expose life inside to readers outside, creating public interfaces in resistance to the prison’s founding purpose in legal quarantine from the public sphere’s discursive life <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. My claim is that whenever DH engages directly with social injustice — let alone when those whose inequality has been socially and legally sanctioned demand a place on digital platforms — DH is best assessed by what it does or aspires to enable among social agents; and such enabling cannot come solely through text analysis, text mining, or close reading, but must come, if it seeks to affect change in practice, through a mid-range reading that receives texts and affects readers as these texts are intended by documentary witnesses: as singular statements that assume and offer context-dependent representative testimony for a collective body.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  When witness-based, text-driven DH projects venture into social justice work, they step onto a well-warn path behind those who have helped to disseminate slave, Holocaust, and other witness literatures, whose reception incurs concrete social effects. These effects have in the past been achieved without the benefits of data mining or enlisting close reading techniques. They have, rather, come about with acknowledgment of the singular human dignity of each witness, at the same time that these witnesses have joined into a testamentary chorus of those on the receiving end of dis-equalizing and dehumanizing practices <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. It is this mid-range reading that DH can aspire to enable and accelerate as a social justice project. Computational methods can help us to decide where to look and help us to look deeper and wider in the archive; they cannot reveal to us how to feel, react, or take action in the face of direct testimony to what the law looks like from the ends of fists and batons inside walled and razor-wired institutions; and it is the moral choice to act that is the beginning of changed practice. Computation can, however, atomize the foundation in human witness that the archive can provide for action. Our primary trust must and can confidently reside in the incarcerated (and the detained, the enslaved…); the voices from inside generously usher us forward into America’s Fourth City. These are teachers who want us to learn everything we can about closed spaces where the law’s violence is always on open display. The archive thus makes possible text analysis that will be of most concrete value when, beyond mining the words of incarcerated people, it is guided by the intentions of those inside. From the start, the APWA has prioritized respectful and non-discriminating posting of incarcerated people’s first-person witness to carceral experience; its faceted search capacities have been built exclusively upon metadata provided by incarcerated people, who complete a questionnaire that welcomes unprogrammed responses. (The questionnaire is linked at the APWA site. See <a href="https://apw.dhinitiative.org/collection-description">https://apw.dhinitiative.org/collection-description</a>.) Other than a signature granting one-time publication rights and contact information, all information is voluntary. The archive accepts this compromise regarding identifying information in face of the need for contributors to protect themselves and to be given full control over their representation. Writers can publish anonymously or under pen names. As described below, search terms for text analysis are now in development with a consultant who has served thirty-eight years in prison and who is helping to build a team of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated advisors. Every step taken outside prison walls has been and will continue to be guided by those inside.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Enlisting DH platforms for concrete social interventions is now vigorous practice, <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  and such work requires ongoing theoretical revision and questioning. Yet it may also be under-explicated. Martha Nell Smith asks regarding DH projects,  “How have these items of knowledge and the organizations and working groups who made them come into being?”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. This question should invite theoretical consideration; here the question is addressed as literally as possible, as a question about inception, sources, aspirations, outcomes, and potentials; and I suggest that it is in historicizing the trajectory of DH social practice that we set the grounds for the questions that theory might ask and address, thus extracting theory from practice.</p>
<p>As Barbara Christian reminds us, theory not based in practice is bound to remain elitist <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. In describing the analog birth and into-digital growth of the APWA, I present an instance of DH serving not simply as a means to expose and study a dis-equalizing institution, but to provide a platform where incarcerated and free people can meet to begin setting the grounds to generate new terms for critical legal and penal theory, and for planning (or conceiving an end to) new penal practice. When theory grows out of practice, it not only avoids elitism; it sets the stage for intervention. In helping broach the walls of prisons (or detention centers, or other state-sponsored lines of confinement), DH practice can constitute a transformative, political action, thus  “shift[ing] the focus of DH from technical processes to political ones”   <sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  This essay suggests that DH can — as methodology — not only host witness born from the  “lived experiences of difference in the U.S.”   <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> , but can also, if read as the dis-equalized direct us, facilitate moving the incarcerated to the front lines of efforts to uncloak the work of an institution built to enforce all manner of inequalities and to censor the dis-equalized. The distant v. close reading debate in DH <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> replicates questions around how to balance addressing mass incarceration as a statistical fact — as a data set — and/or as a human and humanly articulated condition experienced and documented by discrete individuals <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. I want to argue for a plenum of reading proximities by advocating for the neglected middle-range of reading as more than a space of transition between close and distant reading. <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  What I will call cellular reading is the most apt manner of reception of what incarcerated writers — like other literary witnesses — do day by day, decade by decade, over millions of cumulative human years: create paths for readers to follow on the way to precipitating change in practice. Distant reading can aid in mapping the landscape of testament to law’s violence so that we know where to begin in tracking particular, and potentially class-actionable paths through the daily violations of human, constitutional, and civil rights and human decency inside the earth’s largest prison state; it remains in mid-range reading, however, that we will see outside hearts and minds moved to act.</p>
<p>In the spirit of drawing theory from practice, I build my argument upon the back of a biography of the project in point.</p>
<h2 id="the-distance-from-here-to-there">The Distance from Here to There</h2>
<p>In the winter of 2006, I initiated a creative writing workshop inside Attica Correctional Facility. The class was entirely voluntary. It offered no college credit. It would not bolster anyone’s appeals for parole. Only the will to learn to write had brought thirteen men serving twenty to twenty-five-to-life sentences to the room. Over the ensuing ten years, the stories I read and heard painted an unrolling panorama of urban battlegrounds, rural poverty, and the occasional scene of suburban desperation — nearly all marked by some form of addiction or mental illness — as the backdrops to the booby-trapped road that runs from arrest, plea bargains or the very rare occurrence of a jury trial, to incarceration in a place built to produce pain, suffering, and rural employment <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. Their stories regularly reinforced and echoed each other, at the same time that each story was seated in an individual biography. In turn, I could not avoid hearing their reports both closely and at some distance: from the details of life in a home on a particular Bronx or Rochester city block, to the  “public pretenders”  nearly all had hardly spoken with before arriving in court. Over these ten years, dozens of men passed through that workshop. No two were much alike. Yet they held many things in common. <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  Thus began to appear a testimonial corpus seemingly pre-staged for text analysis: denial of freedom denies unlimited randomness in experience. The men who joined the class were Black, Latino, Native-American, Asian, and White, from large and small cities, and came from poor, working-class, and, in one instance, from an affluent background. Together, they offered stories of institutionalized degradation, of coping, and of unimaginable resilience. But these, of course, are not the impressions one gains from outside.</p>
<p>From its inception in 1790, the aim of the American penitentiary was less to cut off lawbreakers from the public than the reverse <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> . In his  <em>Enquiry into the Effect of Public Punishment Upon Criminals and Upon Society</em> , Dr. Benjamin Rush addressed the dangerous effects of letting the condemned speak to or even be seen by the public <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> ; imprisonment would not only stanch such communication; it would deter crime by allowing the images of penal suffering to expand to the limits of public imagination <sup id="fnref2:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Prisons today have become less a holding place for offenders than one relay in a closed circuit: we do not need prisons in order to contain deviancy, Foucault notes; we need them to mark a deviant class and thereby justify security apparatuses that both model and enforce behavioral norms <sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Over the past forty years, the abandonment of rehabilitation and embrace of punishment, or the  “new penality,”  as the prison’s  “ raison d’etre ”   <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>, has been built on the premise that incarcerated people — these (black and brown)  “monsters”  and  “animals”  — simply aren’t like  “us”   <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> .  “The art of punishing,”  Foucault reminds us,  “must rest on a whole technology of representation”   <sup id="fnref2:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Prison walls, today as in 1790, represent law’s monopoly on legitimate violence, they contain and recycle criminalized demographics, they silence the condemned, and in turn they allow fantastic images of the criminalized to be spread without intervention by incarcerated people themselves. The ruse that this is about public safety (incarceration has a marginal effect on crime rates <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>) can be maintained only as long as the public is not apprised of the full, if often wounded humanity of those inside. At the end of a forty-year US punishment wave, Rush’s fear of incarcerated people speaking to those outside is warranted not only by fear of evoking public sympathy; it would rip the screen upon which an eighty-billion-dollar prison industry and popular media have cast all incarcerated people as not-fully-human <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Their voices might dissolve public moral pretense, revealing an industry built on the backs of caged and fully human beings. <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  Facilitating public access to what goes on inside through the testimony of incarcerated people is about shorting such closed circuits. It’s about revealing  “monsters”  as the very able, primary witnesses to, and most competent critics of the lie beneath claims of the threat that all imprisoned people pose, as well as the lies of due process, judicial equity, and respect for human rights. It’s about confronting and exposing the final, legally sanctioned enforcer of institutionalized racism, classism, gender-ism, etc.</p>
<p>The bars to the public serving as secondary witnesses to the primary witnesses of prison conditions are not only made of steel; they have been forged by the courts <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>, congress <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>, and over two generations inside American minds. From the myth of the jury trial promulgated by  <em>Law and Order</em>  while only 2% US criminal cases ever goes to trial <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>, to the carceral soap operas of  <em>OZ</em>  and  <em>Orange is the New Black,</em>  to the latest episode of the human zoo carefully staged for  <em>Lockup</em> , American media have made fortunes selling misrepresentations of incarcerated people.</p>
<p>The critical literature on writing by incarcerated people is growing but is still in its early phase <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. There is only one broad historical survey of US prison writing, H. Bruce Franklin’s pioneering  <em>Prison Literature in America: The Victim as Criminal and Artist</em> , which offers decade-by-decade readings of this work from 1798 to 1989 <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. This book and the texts it explicates make evident, however, that for as long as the US has presented itself as a bastion of liberty, equal opportunity, and judicial fairness, prison witnesses have documented the nation’s working state of intersecting penal apartheids. Prisons isolate. They exile. They quarantine. Yet prison witness makes clear that these messages have never been simply from in  <em>there</em> . They unearth for us the silent chambers beneath the nation Americans call  <em>here</em> .<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>
<p>Franklin’s history ends in 1989, only a decade into the era of true mass-scale incarceration (commonly dated from 1980). Important collections of essays by political and politicized prisoners have appeared since then <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>; and Franklin himself has edited a survey of US prison writing in the twentieth century, reaching to 1995 <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> . But in summer 2009, as I found (again) in searching out new texts for the second iteration of an undergraduate course on US prison writing, there existed no broad national sampling of non-fiction writing by people then living behind bars. In attending national and international conferences for legal scholars and social scientists, I found that even researchers who had conducted surveys or scripted interviews with incarcerated people virtually all crunched this testimony into statistical charts and graphs (which, for their purposes, were certainly of vital importance). I heard no open ended, witness-driven testimony about carceral life. I had not set out to become an editor of prison witness (let alone a digital humanist), but the need — on campus and in the profession — became very clear.</p>
<p>With the help of a research assistant, the first call for essays by imprisoned people went out in fall of 2009. On February 1, 2014,  <em>Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America</em>  was published, including seventy-one essays from twenty-seven states <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>. The title reflects the total population of US prisons and jails. More importantly, as a first sampling of what a national gathering of contemporary prison witness might reveal, the title indicates a collective experience as cohesive as we might expect from citizens writing of their experience of New York, LA, or Chicago.</p>
<p>From among the first forty-five essays received, eleven stable categories of subject matter emerged and persisted into the final organization of the book. This occurred despite the fact that incarcerated people have virtually no means to communicate between facilities, let alone states, and often even between cells blocks inside any one facility<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> ; so the consistency of subjects was striking: autobiographical sketches of the paths to prison, coping with prison life, slice-of-life examples of everyday challenges inside, ways to seek peace, the damage incarceration does to families, the injustices perpetrated inside, critiques of criminal justice policy, the inadequacy of mental and physical health care, activism from inside, prison reentry programs, and messages of warning or hope shouted out to kids on the street or others inside. Take the state names off these essays and it is impossible to tell they are not reporting from one institution committed to vengeance and willful dehumanization, and where the residents struggle mightily, day by day, to make lives worth the name. <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  What the project revealed is that our Fourth City is a metropolis of both willful debilitation and miraculous acts of human resistance, not the least of which is the very act of bearing witness. These are traits that anyone who has worked with incarcerated people might gather; one could do so, however, without gaining the basis for attributing common struggles and victories to a national population. But in gathering this work in a relatively short period of time, from across the nation, the outline of America’s carceral metropolis began to take shape. <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup></p>
<p>In her 2012 essay,  “Why are the Humanities so White?”  Tara McPherson distinguishes a lenticular view, in which two discrete images can be seen in one frame but never at the same time (her model for the separate-but-equal divide between the histories of computing and social justice activism since the 1960s); and a stereoscopic view, which layers distinct viewpoints on the same subject to create a sense of depth <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>. What I had experienced inside Attica and what emerged from the  <em>Fourth City</em>  solicitation was stereoscoping of deeply singular voices, each implicitly demanding — like the human face for camp survivor Emmanuel Levinas, like Holocaust witness for critic D.G. Myers <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup> — an ethical response to the witness borne by individual human beings who are also all exemplars among a mass population; such ethical response, moreover, is asked of a human listener or reader equally implicated in the legal order that concretely and morally marks the distance between the law-breaker and the law-abiding, the condemned and the protected, and those subjected to or spared by the law. Here, stereoscopicism occurs in a mirror: the layered depths of witness’ testimony to law’s violence reveal the degree and manners in which those outside are either spared and protected by the law (especially the white middle and upper classes) or co-objects of criminal justice involvement (especially poor people of color). As in reading witness texts from slavery, the Holocaust, or truth and reconciliation tribunals, it is impossible to hear or read prison witness without hearing echoes across biographies and texts, across razor-wired facility and state (and national) boundaries. It is impossible to ignore abiding tropes generated from spaces that hold those stripped of civil and basic human rights and effective citizenship status — spaces the absence from which marks readers as those in the name of whose security such quarantine exists, or as co-subjects of policing practices outside (much as looking into original stereoscopes impresses us as much with a view of a  <em>past</em> , and with location of ourselves in a present, as with the subject at hand). Readers are asked at once to bear secondary witness, and to accept their own positions as either those in the name of whose protection incarcerated people are forced to struggle to regain their discursive existence, or as the similarly hyper-policed. The light cast by prison witness casts silhouettes around readers outside — silhouettes deepened as readers are exposed to each successive text, in contrast to the limited effects of close reading or pixilated reading at distance.</p>
<p>Stereoscopism better approximates but is not, however, fundamentally adequate to representing this situation, in which disparate and discrete biographies intersect at singular angles with the enervating spaces of the prison and with the legal positions of readers outside <sup id="fnref1:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. Prison witness texts — in their non-interchangeability  <em>and</em>  their clear linkages among themselves and in the minds of readers — are best figured by a term that is at once literal and figurative, at once metaphor and not, and that replicates the enunciatory moment of meeting between witness and reader. This is a meeting that is not so much stereoscopic as  “cellular,”  at-once literally of the body and of architecture, of vulnerable flesh like the reader’s and of the stone and steel that divide writer from writer and writer from reader, while each text carries traces of the DNA of the next and yet remains distinct, as the condition of identity and of life. Cellular reading is mid-range reading; it is reading at proximal distance. No text is the whole, but the whole gains its status as witness as an aggregate of each with each when each is read and held in the mind as a singular whole, rather than as a mere yet-to-be-aggregated and mined data vessel; authority lies in the “typical” moments across texts, while each text remains absolutely authoritative regarding the experience, anger, aspirations, hope, or hopelessness of its author — an author whose testimony, at the same time, is shaped by widely experienced conditions: conditions implicating the reader as part of the public in the public safety rationale for a city in cages.</p>
<p>Computation can accelerate location of common veins in this corpus; it can reach reading communities at rates unimagined by previous witness writers in their own time. DH can, in this way, facilitate a shift of authority from scholarship (or state agencies) to the communities that any work can garner, as Kathleen Fitzpatrick has observed <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>. The APWA also makes clear, however, the need to mind the ethical stakes here. As the archive grows and computational methods are applied, the danger rises of reducing back to data points the testimony of writers struggling to assert their human dignity and singular integrity from among the data piles gathered by state agencies and research. Computational analysis should complement and aid cellular reading; my claim is that, between academically inclined close reading, and computationally enabled distant reading, it is from mid-range, cellular reading that human readers will be moved to social action. It is cellular reading that allows us to participate in the communities that can complete the witness transaction, recognizing voices that never stand alone or outside the legal matrix upon which we are all located; voices that are never effective until embraced by others, and that work directly in the face of organized authority that is often invisible to those outside.</p>
<p>Cellular reading is an irreversible process of revelation. Close reading one piece of prison witness (or slave or Holocaust narrative) is qualitatively distinct from reading five, and twenty, and a hundred; and while few readers can commit to reading thousands of essays, cellular reading can set the ethical context for data mining among much greater numbers.We need simply read enough to see how our ability to doubt, to find excuses for testimony that reveals the collective damage of collectively sanctioned and supported institutions thins and vanishes as we read repeated reports on, for example, lethal medical neglect, or feel the human toll paid by female victims of staff rape that research shows occurs in numbers that rival reported instances of rape outside <sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Amid multiple interfaces, some readers will discover cellular links that surround and mark them as the virtually law-immune or legally protected, while others will feel solidarity as those living outside prison yet in subjection to the law’s pathologies. <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>  Such cellular reading sets the grounds for what Jamie  “Skye”  Bianco calls a  “relational ethics”   <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> both between writers and between writers and readers, where  “context, affect, and embodiment …remain viably dynamic and collaborative”   <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Johanna Drucker notes that  “situatedness and enunciation are intimately bound to each other”   <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Reading prison witness reveals a causal exchange relation between these moments: when incarcerated writers write of their situation, the reader — as a co-subject of policing systems, or their beneficiary — sees revealed their own legal situation within the current order. If cultural influence is indeed at play in every act of interpretation <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, the interpretation of prison witness is irrevocably influenced by the position of the reader within legal culture. Unveiling the complexities of a city in cages, each text retains its singularity even as its uniqueness is dispersed across the whole. Close reading can acknowledge any one text’s ethical demand; but as the numbers of exposures grows an osmotic leak occurs; we hear the reverberations of beating on one steel wall, pouring and echoing into the next across facilities, and state borders, and across the affective interface of writers and readers. While we may then find bracing patterns in data mining the archive, it is the base in cellular reading that reveals that such witness is not like reading fiction or other literary texts bound by time or subject. Here, writing is not representation; it is human and (re)humanizing witness to the legal and extra-legal conditions that surround and demark citizenship and fully human status inside a carceral regime that, as Colin Dayan notes, metes out  “state-sanctioned degradation … propelled by a focus on personal identity [and] the terms by which personality is … threatened, or removed”   <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. Or, as a man from Texas writes,  “Ah to be a human being again! Worthy of respect and affection, capable of dignity and contribution, to have a valuable life&hellip;”   <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The following excerpts are offered as examples of how closely prison witnesses speak to one another’s experience, of cellular testimony to  “state-sanctioned degradation,”  and as practicum in readerly response:</p>

<p>From Alabama:</p>
<p>In tiny surreptitious doses anesthesia is dripped into my heart — a formerly complacent heart that is slowly beginning to resemble my dreadful surroundings. An ache settles somewhere deep inside of me, pain linked to the realization that something once deeply cherished has been stolen from me during my outrageous two plus decades of incarceration. Years of sensory deprivation has withered my ability to respond with anything resembling an emotional reaction. <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup></p>

<p>From Connecticut:</p>
<p>Lately I feel like I&rsquo;m suffocating. Each minute of every day is a slow asphyxiation. The worst death sentence in this country is being buried alive in prison without hope…. I know that in me there must be a human being beneath all this agony. It is a faith belief. <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup></p>

</blockquote>
<p>From Georgia:</p>
<p>After more than 10 years of continuous incarceration, I am slowly losing the will to re-enter a society that has abandoned me. Contemplating this is a symptom of institutionalization - I am cognizant of this fact while unable to do anything to alleviate the downward spiral I&rsquo;m currently experiencing. <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>

<p>From California:</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been seriously deteriorating… [A]t times I get this very primal urge to attack the walls, attack my captors, and try to run free.… Sometimes I’ll go days without leaving the cell, without eating or showering, just paralyzed over the mattress and staring at the walls and having bad dreams. Or I’ll go days unable to sleep, tackling ten projects at once, punching the obscene walls, talking to myself and having hallucinations and wrecked with anxiety. In desperate lapses I’ll hang from a sheet around my neck for a moment, or cut a vein open. <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>From South Carolina:</p>
<p>My life was as different from Laura&rsquo;s [a recent suicide] as it could possibly be. Two years later I was proven wrong when an officer emptied a full can of pepper spray through the flap in my lock up door while I stood on the sink trying to cut my wrist on the fire sprinkler. I hadn&rsquo;t eaten or drank anything in nine days. My own girlfriend was in the cell next door loudly urging me to kill myself. I am proof and testimony that if you do enough time and allow yourself to become lonely enough you will turn to whatever outlet you can find to ease that loneliness a little. If you are addicted and obsessive by nature, as I am, then that addiction and obsession, left unaddressed, will transfer itself to whatever target is available. Be it starving, bingeing, exercise, purging, sex, self mutilation, I&rsquo;ve engaged in them all obsessively during the past years. <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup></p>
<p>Some readers may feel in these passages a seamless continuum with the accepted legal and public safety aims of incarceration. For others, such witness resituates the reader vis-a-vis the law’s magnetic center in state-sponsored violence <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>. As revealing as distant reading might prove, it also risks atomizing such an existential moment. This is a case in which, as Cuban digital activist Ernesto Orozo remarks,  “answers ooze from the circumstances,”  and  “Renewed answers will always come from the resistance”   <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="growing-into-silicon-or-they-came-so-we-built-it">Growing into Silicon; or, They Came, so We Built It.</h2>
<p>The final deadline for  <em>Fourth City</em>  passed in the fall of 2012. But work never stopped coming. Cover letters apologized for arriving late and offered thanks for our willingness to read pages the authors assumed would never see print. The initial pool of 154 essays grew to two hundred, three hundred, then five hundred… Incarcerated people, given the slimmest chance, were willing to risk their safety in order to get word out. <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>  Each day that I walked from the college mail center to my office, I carried yet more envelopes from California and Texas, from Alabama, Oregon and Maine. <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>  But it was not easy finding a publisher for  <em>Fourth City</em>  (which one agent called a  “book for people who can’t afford to buy it”   <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>); in fact, I was still seeking that publisher. I had tapped a vein that would not be stanched. Happily, colleagues had secured a Mellon grant to start up and support digital humanities projects through collaborations between Hamilton Library and Information Technology Services (LITS), a newly minted Digital Humanities Initiative (DHi), and national collaborators <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>. At the end of 2012, we began our conversations.</p>
<p>Credit for building the platform, storage capacities, and the sustainability of DHi-APWA lies with the funders and the DHi-APWA team and LITS in an ongoing, layered Venn relationship; but its inception, the populating of its metadata contents and resulting search facets, and the growth of its content are due to the unrelenting will of those inside to bear witness. <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>  The APWA currently hosts 3,307 essays, the equivalent of over fourty-six volumes the size of  <em>Fourth City</em> . It grows by approximately seven additional volumes each year (500 essays); and that rate is largely the result of a single, quarter-page solicitation in the pages of  <em>Prison Legal News</em> , a monthly magazine dedicated to legal cases, legislation, and investigative reporting of interest to incarcerated people. That we receive this number of essays from a small ad is testament to the sheer size of the prison population; it is that size and scale that has allowed the statistical skills of the social sciences to lead the national discussion of mass incarceration <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>; it is scale that also creates the ethical dilemma that the APWA itself now poses.</p>
<p>Incarcerated people and the writers among them are the subjects of intersecting statistical and documentary determinations: from so-called hot-spot policing, to sentencing guidelines that determine years of punishment from a grid; from the recording of their every demographic trait upon entering jail and prison, to psychological profiling, to the marking of every violation they incur inside, to prison, block, and cell assignment, to whether they recidivate upon release — release decisions increasingly influenced by risk assessment algorithms <sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>. Such mapping and examination, Foucault writes,  “engages [penal subjects] in a whole mass of documents that capture and fix them”   <sup id="fnref3:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Incarcerated people are rightly wary of becoming the subjects of yet further datafication.</p>
<p>At the same time that we can use computation to help map the carceral landscape, socially responsible and responsive text analysis must align itself with, and serve to further the struggle of incarcerated people to be heard and read on their own terms, thus avoiding the danger of refracting and deflecting the work of prison writers — who are themselves the select representatives for other incarcerated people — through our own presumptions. In this vein, we might use computational tools primarily to locate, amid a mass of essays, those subject clusters that incarcerated writers make salient: such as the prison industry’s financial exploitation of incarcerated people, staff assault, damage to family ties, etc. Such indexing can help readers to see the pervasiveness of such concerns across the nation, respect the integrity of individual writers, and create the basis for focused advocacy. Text analysis can thus work for the kind of social justice action that  <em>incarcerated writers</em>  seek to forward. Socially conscientious data mining must recognize that witness texts are not mere data, they are not simulacra. They are the literary corpus of bodies and minds struggling amid the “penal harm” that the carceral state and the American public has embraced for nearly have a century as an explicit aim <sup id="fnref2:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup>. Text analysis can serve this corpus and amplify its voices by maintaining to it less an analytical than an indexical relationship.</p>
<p>At the other extreme from distant reading, meticulously close reading will also not bring us to the understanding of prison texts and practice that prison writers overwhelmingly intend. Incarcerated people know they are held inside a mass-scale system. Even when they focus on their own situations, they clearly understand and articulate those situations as examples, not isolated instances. The image of a city in cages — while it reflects the cohesiveness of subjects and themes among prison texts — moves in the direction of better focusing our views of that mass into the diversity and distinctiveness of a major metropolis. The APWA’s facetted and key word searches allow further granulation — by demographic categories, locations, keywords, and layering of these factors. Computational work, as Moretti observes, offers  “not an obstacle, but  <em>a specific form of knowledge</em> : fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection. Shapes, relations, structures”   <sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>. From their beginning in 1790, as Michael Meranze points out, prisons have been spatial answers to social problems <sup id="fnref2:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref3:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. They are shapes and structures that, as Dr. Rush intended, alienate human relations. What we should be seeking from computer-aided text analysis are mappings of these shapes, structures, and relations as they are reflected in their counter-discourse, in humanizing, mass-scale literary resistance. This is a literature that turns the prison’s shapes and structures inside out: a literary corpus that exposes the denaturalizing angles, shapes, and structures of penal confinement; a corpus of textualized bodies and minds and hearts, presenting for mutual exchange and transformation, the shared, fluid, and ineradicably interactive humanity of those whose freedom outside and unfreedom inside are built upon, and have been warped by, over two hundred years of broken relationships.</p>
<p>My conviction is that this damage will not be repaired by analysis alone. Instead, we might approach our work as that of curation, what I would term, “thick curation” — or, in a more text friendly term  “thick indexing.”  The attempt here is not to follow  <em>our</em>  interests in the archive, but to learn to see, and engage computation to aid our learning to see law and justice as imprisoned people see them — to see, for example, the wreckage that furnishes the path to so-called justice, and the ways in which the law and a broken civil society have created that wreckage. Thick curation and indexing will us to follow the branches of subjects and concerns among incarcerated people. One model for this work is Darwin’s sketch of speciation, reproduced in Moretti’s  <em>Graphs, Maps, Trees</em>  (Figure 1; <sup id="fnref1:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>).</p>

<p>Translated into a register of texts, this graph becomes an index. The following lines are excerpted from a list — based on the experience of the archive’s front-line readers of incoming essays, with the consultation of a formerly incarcerated person — that will serve to seed further work in text analysis.</p>

<p>Text analysis can help to populate these tiers with whole essays. Rather than atomizing prison witness, this indexing model recognizes each essay, as a whole, as an organic element of any map of life inside, and capable of presenting its own purposes. It is important to note that nowhere does the archive suggest that its makers presume to speak for incarcerated people, or presume to suggest what readers will or should find there. This may be why, as the archive grows, the rate of submissions increases <sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>. The APWA’s credibility deepens in the eyes of incarcerated people (with the aid of internet-enabled allies outside) simply because it has been trusted by other incarcerated people to treat their work in whole, without editing, and without secondary purposes.</p>
<p>Amid a highly politicized, national debate on mass incarceration,<sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup>  the archive is built on trust in incarcerated people and archive visitors; it is not intended to make new arguments — as Tom Scheinfeldt once claimed it may not yet be time for DH to do <sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup> — but to provide a meeting place where new questions can be asked about the human effects and costs of the current legal order. Incarcerated people have been spoken for (and objectified, medicalized, and demonized) for too long, including by academics. A thick indexing method seeks to disentangle branches of consensus that appear among prison witnesses even while imprisoned writers are denied communication with their peers. The APWA’s sole presumption is that it can present the cells of those branches and, in future, using computational aids, offer readers places to start on the path of extended cellular reading.</p>
<p>While DH work shrinks physical spaces, it does not necessarily change the direction of Supply (campus scholarship) to Reception (by other scholars, students, and the broader public). The APWA attempts to serve as the mediating facilitator of an ambi-valent, carceral margins-mainstream meeting point and conversation that, among other effects, sidesteps the  “hack v. yack” <sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup>  dyad at the moment theory assumes a secondary role to — and indeed grows from — an extra-academic dialogic. Sociologist Bruce Western observes that the public safety returns on incarceration are now badly outweighed by the social damage it imposes <sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>. The APWA offers visitors (including voters) the opportunity to measure the human breadth and depth of carceral damage. The project does not pose arguments but allows us to ask by implication what new  “materialist epistemologies”   <sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup> might be possible if we resituate incarcerated people from their current place in public discourse as a mass deficit, to positions as our foremost authorities on what imprisoned people are, what prisons actually do, the real effects of the politics and economics of the criminal justice industry as a whole, and how we might proceed on the path toward greater humanity in addressing all the social, civil, economic, political, and ethical failures that surround crime and racialized punishment. The archive allows us to consider what happens when we shift authority from prison administrators, law-makers, judges, prosecutors, police, and outside scholars, into the hands of the community of organic intellectuals among incarcerated people. It suggests that DH social justice work is what DH/SJW enables: demystification of historically dis-equalizing institutions, laying new grounds for newly goaled public policy and growing consensus about the practicality and moral imperative for a range of abolitions: from judicial misconduct, to police violence, the knowing creation of employment deserts, domestic violence, poverty, failing schools, to prisons themselves.</p>
<p>Continuing the literary legacy documented by Franklin, these writers are creating what may well become one of the largest bodies of witness literature in human history <sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup>  — a literary corpus only possible on a platform that can sidestep the censors (market-sensitive agents, editors, and sales reps) of commercial and academic analog publishing. Unlike the most salient on-line witness archives — at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum [USHMM] and the University of North Carolina’s Documenting the American South’s archive of slave narrative <sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup> — the APWA is a repository of primary witness that expands as you read this sentence, as incarcerated people bear testimony to their experience. Though already the largest such archive, it is clearly in its early growth. Yet even now, its promise is clear: These writers are not only getting word out about what life is like inside; many write about their lives from birth to arrest, as well as through cumulative millennia of incarceration. What DH work has done in this case is to build a platform not only for those outside to look inside, but for those outside to see, from inside, the contours of US policing, judicial, and carceral practices, as well as from the interiors of the homes and communities affected by poverty, untreated addiction and mental illness, unemployment, crime, and the damaging feedback loop of mass-scale punishment that criminalizes poor people of color, the gender non-conforming, and the mentally ill — punishment that can exacerbate the very problems that precipitate crime <sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup>. That closed loop is only possible as long as the prison’s walls are reinforced by political and cultural circuits that remain unbroken, as long as the public sees its social distance from the condemned as based in moral virtue (rather than the chances of birth) and thus lives complacently with walls of concrete while consuming the salacious media misrepresentations used by  “tough on crime”  prosecutors, judges, and law makers to garner votes despite a steady, twenty-six-year decline in rates of crime <sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup>. Breaking such circuits and dismantling such walls will not be achieved by close reading of a handful of essays, nor by reading data hit lists and clusters (however useful such reading methods clearly are to particular purposes and, again, to helping us determine where to read at greater depth). These simply are not how incarcerated writers conceive of their work or intend it to be read; and if incarcerated lives matter, so should the intentions among their representatives.</p>
<p>Legal scholar Robert Cover famously noted that  “Legal interpretation takes place in a field of pain and death”   <sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup>: the law suppresses violence by casting legal sanction over the acts of violence carried out by the police, courts, and prisons. Since the deaths of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Sandra Brown, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and too many others, and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the cost-benefit balance of this sanctioning (Black costs v. white benefits) have been called into question. Cover did not live to see his claims brought home by cell-phone videos, and he only tentatively pointed toward the corollary to his own claim: Without understanding both the breadth and the depth of human suffering experienced on the receiving end of legalized violence, we can never understand the full human cost of, let alone understand our location within the current legal order. This is a cost and location that prison witness, on a scale that only a digital platform can provide, makes clear.</p>
<p>As a social justice enterprise, new here are the technologies that offer rapid dissemination, facetted searching, and the rich rewards (and temptations) of distant reading that create the close v. distant, either/or dilemma. What is not new is the cellular or mid-range reading that the APWA helps to make possible, at an accelerated scale, for prison witness.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-the-present">The History of the Present</h2>
<p>A first major proof of the power of a peculiarly American literary corpus, subjected to cellular reading, to foment social change came with the rise of slave narratives. First-person testimony by former slaves would prove one of the most effective weapons in the abolitionist arsenal <sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup>. While documenting previously unimaginable conditions of degradation, and thus confronting southern propaganda, the witness borne by former slaves presented depths of moral and intellectual acuity, emotional allegiance and social alliances that few white readers had to practice in their own lives. <sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">97</a></sup>  Like incarcerated people today, former-slaves countered popular misrepresentation of a dehumanizing institution, protesting their condition by bearing witness to the dignity of the objects of popular invective. This was not achieved by close reading of a handful of texts, nor, of course, with data sets, but by cellular reading, in which every whipping taken by one author stood proxy for a thousand, including those whose experience never saw print, and thus exposing the moral culpability of passive compliance. All witnesses speak for the muted, for the  <em>musselmanner</em> , as the living called the walking dead inside Auschwitz <sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">98</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>; and all witness recipients are (at least potentially) morally repositioned by such reception. The aim of the APWA, after 231 years, is to open precisely that public,  “affective exchange”  that Benjamin Rush sought to block in fear that exposure of human suffering would evoke sympathy and desire to relieve that suffering <sup id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">99</a></sup>; an exchange much like that which slave narrative helped to precipitate war and the abolition of slavery. With this aim, the argument here is, again, not against data analysis. It is for a plenum and balance of reading proximities, from close, into cellular reading (with its tried historical precedents), to those generated by computation, and for an ethically responsible complementarity of reading proximities that never loses sight of the primacy of whole statements by whole individuals. Stephen Ramsey remarks that DH is strongest when it resists seeing data as  “more valid”  than humanistic inquiry <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. My claim is that such a balance — and embrace of the broad, deep, and morally engaging middle ground between the close and the distant — is best suited to affect change in social practice. History and prison witnesses themselves have rushed the gates of analog publication and into DH; we must take care to avoid atomizing their testimony.</p>
<p>Witness literatures are resistance literatures, and  “The literature of resistance sees itself…as immediately and directly involved in a struggle against ascendant or dominant forms of ideological and cultural production”   <sup id="fnref1:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>; they are grounded in concrete and whole human experiences of the effects of these forms of productions — including the production forms of digital computation used by state agencies — and they are collectively dialogic: duty, propriety, right and wrong, justice, and equity bear different denotations to a slave and to an incarcerated person than they do to slave masters and prison guards. Acts of prison testimony document not only how failures in public policy, civil services, mental and physical health care, foster care, public education, policing and court and prison practices are translated into broken lives; they instruct us in how to retain our humanity in the face of legally organized suffering, which also includes retaining human status in a world beset by datafication. As Jill Stauffer writes,  “…understanding what dehumanizes also helps us determine what we take a human being to be”   <sup id="fnref:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">100</a></sup>. For even while prisons strip incarcerated people of other means of attempting to make good of their pasts, they are doing the work of restorative justice, offering up what they have learned from their lives, their crimes, and from our punishments. This is the reason why we must pick our steps carefully between the ironies that line the path of (re)datafication of voices struggling to break free from the data piles gathered by the administrators of state violence, and by researchers outside. As noted, APWA writers provide the contents of the archive’s metadata; they can also choose to withhold that information, not only for their own protection, but as an exercise of freedom.</p>
<h2 id="from-analog-to-digital-witness">From Analog to Digital Witness</h2>
<p>Commitment to individual witnesses starts with granting full discretion over the metadata they provide. It continues with the hard-copy documents we receive, scanning pages so that visitors can see (as far as flat screens are able to convey) the material condition of individual texts. These include hand writing (in about half of all submissions; Fig. 2); texts typed on manual typewriters and word processors — the latter available to those few with access to computer stations in classrooms or who have white collar jobs inside (Fig. 3 and 4); and, less frequently, texts previously published in prison newsletters and newspapers (the latter by third parties outside; Fig. 5, 6).</p>

<p>While the value of all prison witness is in principle equal, the conditions of composition clearly are not. Prison-composed texts show evidence of state-imposed  “resistance in the materials” ; but rather than  “reveal[ing] opportunity,”  as Bethany Nowviskie claims <sup id="fnref:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">101</a></sup> , this manner of resistance shows the unequal distribution of opportunities inside. A text composed with a ballpoint pen filler (the plastic cylinders prohibited since they can be turned into tattoo guns, syringes, or weapons) and a library staff clerk’s word-processor indicate different opportunities in the very act of composition. A newspaper article necessarily indicates outside support. The graphic state of texts offers one consistently distinguishing material indicator of what it is for the writer at hand to write from inside. As Paul Fyfe claims (in another context)  “the accidents are often essential”   <sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">102</a></sup>. The accidents of prison-witness documents announce their emergence from the unequal conditions of writers in willfully low-to-no-tech environments.</p>
<p>This, of course, is lost amid big data, along with the voice of the individual, and the distinct conditions inside each prison, prison block, and prison cell; and such documentation is, after all, largely the point for these writers. Life with an aggressive, schizophrenic cellmate in a grossly understaffed prison is quite different from a tenth year in solitary confinement, and from life with a cellmate with whom one shares interests in, say, Scrabble and historical fiction. Only mid-range reading can account for such differences in the way that these writes intend, and in the ways that can affect the ethical agents lighted up inside witness readers — however well text analysis might supplement any such effect.</p>
<p>The next level of individuation of these writers is, of course, the voices of the texts, which range from desperate, semi-literate cries for help, fact-based policy critiques, and hip-hop inflected shout outs, to structured legal briefs, angry diatribes, wistful pleas, clinical treatment proposals, and everything between.<sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">103</a></sup>  Beyond single voices, there is the subject matter of these essays, which, as noted, narrows the range from all included voices to a recognizable set of issues (though often multiple and mixed inside individual essays) inside facilities whose basic mission is the same: to confine human beings against their will and do them damage. While we mine for broad sets of words, sentiments, syntactical patterns, etc., cellular reading reveals that even when general subject matter may be similar, and the language similar enough to fall together in text analysis, each writer brings their individual biographies, conditions, and experience to these issues in distinct settings; each writes at once to document and protest their particular conditions, and to represent US incarceration  <em>en masse</em> . (Even in the small sampling above in figures 2 through 6, note how often writers assume the authority to address the prison system as a whole.) Mass incarceration dehumanizes by treating individuals  <em>as</em>  mere units of a mass. Data mining can no doubt reveal important and telling patterns in such statements, and it can lead us to rich sites for closer reading; but it can also — like state actors — reduce imprisoned people and their discourse to types. We cannot undo mass incarceration by the massification of prison witness; nor, even as it helps us map, can we expect data points to evoke the affective responses needed to motivate advocacy for changes in penal conditions, thinking, or policy. These writers write at their risk, in order both to distinguish themselves from and to witness for a mass population. The mid-range reading for which I’m advocating is a practice that contributors assume. Lexical patterns and word frequencies can reveal broad trends within a corpus; they are not what prison witnesses intend to create, and it is with respect for and to seek guidance from the incarcerated that the APWA was built, as a basis for policy critique and activism aimed at concrete changes in practice. The other side of this project is, of course, in the hands of readers using the search capacities availed to them by the site and populated by information provided by incarcerated people.</p>
<p>Visitors will come to the archive with a range of motives and curiosities. It is in the aggregate of visitor reading patterns and purposes and outcomes where there unfolds the critical mirror effect, the greater-than-individual/less-than-mass-scale balance point ( <code>&gt; &lt;</code> ) that serves as a fulcrum for the demassifying of mass-scale witness while fully cognizant (as are prison writers) of a mass-scale backdrop. One can, for example, select out essays by writers who self-identify as African American, as male, and as confined in Michigan, thus curating, for the first time, a cellular network of men who can speak to racial and legal conditions in that state. This is the point (both critical moment and purpose) of cellular or proximal reading aided by search capacities. The many ways in and subjects about which incarcerated people write become animated by the many ways of searching, reading, and curating this work. Daniel J. Cohen notes that  “ <em>Curation</em>  becomes more important than publication once publication ceases to be limited”   <sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup>. Working with prison witness, curation becomes inextricably political; it expands, into social and legal practice, Alan Liu’s claim that DH can establish new communities between the humanities and the public <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. One community that has been created of necessity around the APWA — creating a new opportunity from the  “resistance in the materials”  — is that of transcribers of handwritten essays into internally searchable texts.  “Transcribe-athons”  held at libraries, courses that offer transcription as a requirement option, and people outside of academia volunteering their time have joined in the work of making carceral witness available to search. At their best, such projects refocus DH on the  “intersection of digital production and social transformation”   <sup id="fnref2:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. On the other, big-data side of this meeting point, computational analysis is, as noted, now in progress, and it will open a range of reading, research, and secondary witness methods to view and to multiplication.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In the final chapter of Michelle Alexander’s 2010 best-selling  <em>The New Jim Crow</em>  — a book that helped raise the conversation about mass incarceration into a national debate <sup id="fnref2:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup> — the author warns:  “Isolated victories can be won — even a string of victories — but in the absence of a fundamental shift in public consciousness, the system as a whole will remain intact”   <sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Political scientist Marie Gottschalk echoes Alexander’s conclusion and (inadvertently) suggests where such a shift might begin, modelled on an earlier literary revolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The slave narratives of the antebellum period, which graphically rendered the physical pain that slaves suffered and made it widely visible, helped to propel the abolitionist cause. Today, what happens in prison stays mostly in prison, making it harder to draw connections in the public mind between justice on the inside and justice on the outside. The ability to identify with an offender — or not — is a key predictor of why people differ in their levels of punitiveness. The invisibility of the millions of people behind bars has made it extremely difficult to alter the negative portrait that members of the general public have in their heads of people who have been convicted of a crime. They are simply prisoners and criminals. As such, they often are denied their humanity and any right to democratic accountability, much as slaves were in the United States.<br>
<sup id="fnref3:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The aim of the APWA is to unveil the prison and imprisoned people from centuries of intentional invisibility and willful misrepresentation, as well as to invite humanists of all stripes — with their highly nuanced, diverse, and diversifying manners of reading — back into the work of helping to understand what US prisons actually do, what the full, rich range of imprisoned people encompasses, and to allow and invite the general public, as well as lawmakers and the families of incarcerated people, to meet those who are arguably our most incisive guides to a world beyond prisons. My hope is that the APWA, as well as other DH workers and especially those working with first-person witness corpora, will use the powerful tools now at hand to amplify and arrange, as witness voices dictate, rather than merely to datify the testimony of those on the receiving end of collectively organized, silencing, and too often silently suffered institutions of legal quarantine.</p>
<p>For every man, woman, or trans person recorded on video while dying at police hands, thousands of Americans are quietly disappeared into US prisons. These people are now speaking in mass because DH/SJW has allowed them to speak from across state boundaries, from city and country, raising a chorus that sounds out every pothole on the road of opportunity supposedly open to every American. Reading of the suffering demanded for stumbling upon that road, we are forced to reassess whether any concrete facts lie behind the language we use to discuss rule of law, due process, and justice. No political representative, no social scientist, and no one else speaking from outside can provide what direct witness to legally sanctioned suffering offers. No other platform can open that witness to a world that today needs to learn humility before the voices of those on the receiving end of populist and demagogic rhetoric, which saw its recent inception in the rhetoric of  “law and order.”   <sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup>  Countering the dehumanizing, tribal nationalism we see rising today, witness literatures offer the chance to strengthen as we test the common terms we use to understand our humanity; and this is understanding that we need in order to underwrite democratic institutions.</p>
<p>This is what empathic revolutions do: they open one lexicon in order to recalibrate another, humbling unquestioned presumptions about what constitutes the human. Prison witness has the potential to dismantle and reset the terms of discussion of a nation that regularly claims itself a model to the world of humane, democratic, and egalitarian practices, offering a new vision of how we might proceed. It illuminates, as the testimony of former slaves once did, just where and how civil life, its capital means, cultural and social assumptions, and majoritarian tyrannies — once translated into legal enforcement — have worked to sustain an American underclass. On its basis — gathered, archived, disseminated, read, curated, as well as analyzed, and mined at scale — we might be positioned to recalibrate how we theorize and practice law, punishment, and even nationhood. <sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup></p>
<p>My conviction is that readers willing to read prison witness will find spread before them not only a richly illustrated map of our failures to care for each other — civic, political, ethical, economic, and social — but a map as well for building a nation empathic at last to all of its members: citizens and non-citizens of all races and ethnicities, all classes, genders, creeds, abilities, and sexualities… In response to calls for DH to address inequality and social injustice, digital humanists can seek to build platforms for activism modeled on proven reading methods of the past while keeping their eyes on the yet untouched horizon of a more humane and equitable future.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web has introduced a massive change in the cognitive processes of reading: skimming has become the most popular way in which readers interact with written texts on digital support, with possible enormous consequences on how human beings process information and articulate complex thought <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. On the other hand, digital environments have an immense, often underdeveloped, potential to improve interactive engagement and exploration of information, integrating very different media and conveying extremely complex and multifaceted messages. Readers of the future should be educated to critically approach a text through digital technologies, making full use of this potential, and going beyond the reading processes conceived for texts encoded on static supports. In this paper, we propose the application of text alignment as one method to empower the reflective engagement with digital texts, specifically in the context of language learning.</p>
<p>Text alignment, and more specifically translation alignment, is a type of annotation,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  which consists in analytically matching a word or expression in a text with the corresponding ones in another text, often in a different language, in environments created to collect aligned word pairs. This is an exceptionally complex hermeneutic task, by which readers are induced to problematize the function and implications of morphosyntactic, semantic, and expressive devices of a language, even of their own native tongue.</p>
<p>This paper collects a set of preliminary observations on groups of students that have used translation alignment in the framework of language courses at various levels of expertise. We propose text alignment as a way to empower the perception of the complexity of a written source, but also as a method to leverage usual obstacles in the process of reading in a different language by directly engaging with original literary texts.</p>
<h2 id="principles-of-translation-alignment">Principles of Translation Alignment</h2>
<p>Translation alignment is one of the most popular applications of Natural Language Processing. It is defined as the comparison of two or more texts in different languages, also called parallel texts or parallel corpora <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  by means of automated or semi-automated methods. The main purpose is to define which parts in a source text correspond to which parts of a second text in a different language. The result often takes the form of a list of pairs of items, which can be words, sentences, or larger text chunks like paragraphs or documents. This task is often performed automatically through various methods, which often require large amounts of training data: one of the most traditional methods for automated translation alignment is statistical machine translation <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, which uses statistical methods to extract and identify correspondences of words and phrases in two parallel texts, based on already available aligned pairs.</p>
<p>The alignment of texts in different languages, however, is an exceptionally complex task, because of the several variables involved. It is often difficult to find perfect correspondences across languages that express ideas through different morphosyntactic constructs, with variations in word order, sentence length, and even underlying cultural significance. Machine-actionable systems are often inefficient in providing equivalences for wordplays, metaphors, and other rhetorical devices. The resulting aligned pairs may be one-to-one (one word in the source text corresponds to one word in the translation), but often align as one-to-many, many-to-many, or many-to-one. Each word correspondence may be complete or perfect (with complete overlap between two words), but also possible or incomplete (partial overlap, or both words being a translation of each other only in certain contexts <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>).</p>
<p>For these reasons, manually aligned word pairs are one of the main sources of training data, and are not only employed for the implementation of machine translation systems, but are increasingly useful for many other purposes, including information extraction and automated creation of bilingual lexica <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Therefore, large corpora of manually aligned word pairs are a much desired resource, which remains, however, extremely rare.</p>
<p>The operation of collecting training data is often configured as a Citizen Science effort: for example, Glosbe (<a href="https://glosbe.com/">https://glosbe.com/</a>) provides thousands of dictionaries created from the manual alignment of word pairs performed by a community of users.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  However, because of the hermeneutic complexity implied in the alignment across different languages, translation alignment has also a powerful pedagogical potential. We have implemented a specific web-based environment, called Ugarit, to provide a framework for language learning applications through translation alignment.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugarit-translation-alignment-editor">The Ugarit Translation Alignment Editor</h2>
<p>The first public web-based environment for manual text alignment of parallel corpora was conceived within the Alpheios Project (<a href="http://alpheios.net/">http://alpheios.net/</a>), and is currently hosted by the Perseids Project (<a href="https://www.perseids.org/">https://www.perseids.org/</a>). The editor offers an easy environment to manually match corresponding words in two parallel texts.</p>
<p>The Ugarit Translation Alignment Editor (<a href="http://ugarit.ialigner.com/">http://ugarit.ialigner.com/</a>), developed in 2016 by Tariq Yousef at the University of Leipzig, was conceived as the first version of an improved interface that could perform more extensive alignment tasks than the Alpheios editor: it allows alignment in up to three texts, incorporates transliteration of non-Latin alphabets, and collects manually aligned pairs as training datasets <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Moreover, it allows almost immediate visible online publication of the material.</p>
<p>The first version of the tool was made public in March 2017. Since then, Ugarit has registered an ever-increasing number of visits and new users.</p>
<p>Originally, Ugarit was developed to collect training data for the implementation of statistical machine translation of historical languages, mainly Ancient Greek, Latin, and Persian, for which few to none aligned datasets exist. Ideally, historical languages are closed systems with a finite number of words and very limited change in the foreseeable future. Therefore, it should be possible to create adequately efficient automated methods of statistical machine translation based on a relatively small training dataset.</p>
<p>However, after the tool was made public, the number and variety of languages included by the users has steadily increased and has gone far beyond the original intent: at the moment this article is being written, 45 languages are included in Ugarit, including Ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic, Persian, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Croatian, Armenian, Japanese, Chinese, Syriac, Sanskrit, Coptic, Egyptian, Akkadian, and Ethiopic; 465 unique users, and about 24,500 parallel texts, are currently hosted.</p>
<p>The home page of Ugarit offers a quick overview of the languages currently available (the graph showing the proportions of the respective corpora), the number of users and texts, the available word pairs, and the newest alignments.</p>

<p>The workflow is simple: users can upload their corpus in text format, or import it by calling its CTS URN from the Perseus Digital Library (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/</a>) <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Then, the parallel texts can be manually aligned by matching words or groups of words. Resulting pairs are automatically stored in the database, and can then be exported in XML or tabular format.</p>
<p>Currently, Ugarit works with up to three texts in different languages, and there is virtually no limit to the amount and length of texts that can be uploaded. A clickable option enables the user to decide whether the alignment can be publicly visible on the website or not. When the default value is kept, the text appears in the homepage of the website, and other users can inspect the alignment by hovering with the mouse on individually paired tokens, which are automatically highlighted. The proportion of aligned tokens is indicated in the colored bar below the text: the green indicates the rate of matching words, the red the rate of non-matching words.</p>
<p>For languages with non-Latin alphabets, Ugarit offers automatic transliteration, which is visible when the pointer hovers on the desired word. This feature is currently available for Greek, Arabic, Persian,<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  Armenian, and Georgian.</p>

<p>Translation pairs are stored in a local database that gathers data from the manually aligned texts, but also from bilingual dictionaries and automatically aligned texts with GIZA++.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  This database would form the bulk of training data to improve automatic translation alignment methods focusing on historical languages.</p>

<p>As such, the database of translation pairs serves two main functions: first, it serves search queries to provide information on all the available translations of a word. Therefore, if the user looks for a word (for instance, life) with the search function available on the home page, the output displays all the available aligned pairs currently hosted in Ugarit. In this way, the user can access an extended number of translations of a word in many different languages.</p>

<p>Second, Ugarit provides training data to the Dynamic Lexicon (<a href="http://dynamiclexicon.com/">http://dynamiclexicon.com/</a>), which applies the principle of triangulation to extract bilingual pairs across Ancient Greek, Persian, and Latin, using bridge pairs in Greek/English, Persian/English, and Latin/English: the Dynamic Lexicon fetches alignment information from all available aligned corpora, and it uses aligned languages as pivot to fetch translated words in other languages that may bear the same meaning <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. So, each aligned pair functions as a translation vector to access more matches in other languages that are not directly aligned. This method is based on the assumption that two words in two given languages are more likely to match if they are translations of the same word in a third language <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. The accuracy of the triangulation can be improved by expanding the available corpus of translation pairs, considering available part-of-speech classification, or adding more pivot languages <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In other words, Ugarit was designed as a Citizen Science resource to collect training datasets on historical languages from a variety of sources and projects. One of the most important initiatives in this regard was the Hafez Project (<a href="http://dynamiclexicon.com/hafez/">http://dynamiclexicon.com/hafez/</a>; <a href="http://www.divan-hafez.com">http://www.divan-hafez.com</a>) led by Maryam Foradi at the University of Leipzig <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, which tested how German and Persian speakers aligned textual portions of Hafez using English as a bridge language. The results indicated that, provided with the appropriate scaffolding by using English as a bridge language, users with no knowledge of the source language could generate word alignments with the same output accuracy generated by expert users in both languages of source and target texts. The study showed that, while the long-term pedagogical effectiveness of this method is comparable with learning vocabulary with flashcards, the vocabularies learned both intentionally with flashcards and incidentally through text alignment had a significantly better retention <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These results suggested that alignment could serve as a pedagogical tool with a certain effect of long-term retention of vocabulary. Between 2017 and 2019, we conducted a pilot study investigating how students of historical languages could use translation alignment to improve their learning experience through direct engagement with original texts. The lack of scholarship on the pedagogical application of alignment as a tool for language learning, and the complexity involved in the reproducibility of the experience, compel us to start with pre-experimental observations from specific cases, where translation alignment has been applied as a standard method during language courses. Our initial observations provide the justification for a more experimental design.</p>
<h2 id="our-pilot-study">Our Pilot Study</h2>
<p>Ugarit was used in graduate and undergraduate semester-long Classics courses at the Universities of Tufts and Furman, with different focuses: language (mainly Ancient Greek and Latin) at elementary, intermediate, and upper level, literature in translation, literature surveys, and individual research projects.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  The use of translation alignment was incorporated in the teaching practice as a structural element:</p>
<ul>
<li>The students made continuous use of Ugarit in class, using and creating aligned translations as a reading support.</li>
<li>The task of aligning more lengthy chosen texts against one or two translations constituted the main type of assignment, in the form of individual research projects at various degrees of complexity: depending on the course and level, the students produced bilingual and trilingual alignments, whose accuracy was graded accordingly.</li>
<li>The results were discussed in the form of research papers and presentations, in class and also in public venues.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The students reported their observations on the process, evaluated how it affected their understanding of the source, and performed a qualitative analysis on the languages in question, examining specific morphosyntactic, semantic, and expressive phenomena.</p>
<p>We observed the application of this workflow on students with very diverse language skills, including those who mastered other modern languages, and those whose native language was not English. We propose three cases of study:<br>
Students who were proficient in the source language and had complete mastery of one other language (including the native tongue).  Students who were proficient in two different languages, and had basic knowledge of a third one.  Students who were proficient in one or more languages, but had no prior knowledge of the source language.</p>
<p>In the following paragraphs, we report the considerations formulated by the students themselves, and our observations on the outcomes of the process.</p>
<h2 id="case-1-students-of-the-source-language">Case 1: Students of the source language</h2>
<p>Students of Case 1 were enrolled in intermediate and upper level courses in historical languages, mainly Ancient Greek or Latin. They performed two tasks:<br>
Pairwise alignment between the source text and one chosen translation in a modern language.  Alignment of the source text against two different translations.</p>
<p>The purpose of the first exercise was to set the groundwork for a structural analysis of the most important morphosyntactic and semantic devices of the source language, comparing how those features were rendered in a different language (often English), of which the students had complete mastery. In the second exercise, they built upon this experience to draw an evaluation of two competing translations, focusing on the different ways in which complex linguistic phenomena can be rendered in another language.</p>

<p>Undergraduate, native English speaker, intermediate Latin. The student performed a three-text alignment of a passage from the  <em>Metamorphoses</em>  by Apuleius, comparing the original and two chosen English translations (A.S. Kline, 2016 and R. Graves, 1950), to discover differences in translation strategies in a very complex and rhetorically skilful literary work. The focus of the observation was the semantics of different words and expressions with potential ambiguity, but also the different ways the translators addressed the challenges of rendering Latin syntactical structures in a completely different linguistic system. The student then created a new English translation, discussing where it distanced itself from the original and which aspects were instead retained. The comparison between two very different authorial translations proved useful to understand different strategies of addressing relevant linguistic and semantic problems, but also to help the student to find their own translator’s voice.</p>

<p>Undergraduate, English-Chinese speaker, upper-elementary Greek. The student aligned the original text of  <em>Odyssey</em>  9.105-115 against two different English translations, in prose and poetry respectively (A.T. Murray, 1919 and S. Lombardo, 2000). The student used the correspondences in meaning and words across the two English renderings to individuate possible matching words in the Greek, specifically focusing on the potentially discrepant translation strategies between prose and verse. Overall, the prose translation revealed a slightly better alignment rate, but typical Greek stopwords, such as δέ or τε, were consistently not translated in both English versions.</p>
<h2 id="case-2-students-of-a-third-language">Case 2: Students of a third language</h2>
<p>The typical case for trilingual alignment was a student who was proficient in two languages, and wished to improve a third one. The student would perform a trilingual alignment (possibly preceded by a pairwise alignment between the two better-known languages), systematically comparing a lesser-known language against two translations. The student would use the knowledge of the first two languages to leverage the obstacles in understanding the third one, by recognizing common syntactical patterns, morphologies, or similarities in vocabulary.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this case was not limited to the study of historical languages: a collateral advantage of trilingual alignment was that students with proficiency in a historical language could use this opportunity to focus on another language that they knew less, often a second modern language that they were studying at the same time.</p>

<p>Undergraduate, native English speaker, advanced Latin, basic German. The student performed a trilingual alignment of Tacitus’  <em>Germania</em> , against an English and a German translation, and used his knowledge of Latin to improve his mastery in German. In his final report, he observed higher matching rate between the two inflected languages than with English: rather paradoxically, comparing German and Latin resulted easier than English and Latin. The English translation chosen was, on the other hand, approached with some criticism, because of its lengthy rendering of expressions that resulted equivalent in German and Latin.</p>

<p>Graduate, Chinese native speaker, English as second language, intermediate Ancient Greek. The student performed a trilingual alignment of Sophocles’  <em>Ajax</em> , aligning the Greek text, the English translation by Sir R.C. Jebb (1896), and a Chinese version based on the English. While the Chinese and the English obviously displayed a higher matching rate, the student was able to use the knowledge of both languages to individuate correspondences with the Greek, and also to establish where there was no available match for Greek words or concepts.</p>
<h2 id="case-3-no-prior-knowledge-of-the-source-language">Case 3: No prior knowledge of the source language</h2>
<p>The third case involved students, enrolled in courses on culture or literature, who had no prior knowledge of the source language and were also not studying it. The students were given short sections of a source text and corresponding translations in various languages, and performed several tasks aimed at gradually building a critical approach to the original:<br>
Individuate single words in the source text, such as holy, honor, or love, and align them with the corresponding words in a translation in a chosen language. The goal of this exercise was to develop an understanding of the depth of crucial cultural concepts, by assessing the many different ways in which the same word in the source text could be translated.  Compare how specific expressions were rendered in two translations, and then align them against the source text.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  The students focused on different ways of conveying morphosyntactic constructs across languages, critically approaching different translation strategies.  Complete bilingual or trilingual alignment of a short passage, with intensive and systematic analysis of the linguistic and expressive content. The purpose of this exercise was to let students assess the linguistic differences between the languages in question, and partly to demonstrate to them that they could, in fact, approach a text in a language that they did not know at all, by means of translation alignment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed that students who had mastery of more than one language almost immediately learned to use trilingual alignment to leverage the difficulties in dealing with a language that they had never seen before. This strategy proved effective in various cases: many students completed the first two assignments using both English and a third modern language (often Spanish or French); non-native English speakers used their native language to better understand complex words and expressions; students who mastered another classical language tested if they could use it to better engage with phenomena like inflected forms, participial uses, and subordination. Overall, trilingual alignment proved to be an effective strategy to engage with the source text, as already assessed in <a href="#case2">Case 2</a>. By the end of the course, students were able to align relatively long passages against one or more translations.</p>

<p>Undergraduate, native English speaker, advanced Ancient Greek, no Latin. The student used trilingual alignment to verify whether the knowledge of Greek, with English as a bridge language, could serve to leverage the unfamiliarity with a text in Latin. The passage chosen, from Herodotus’  <em>Histories</em> , was aligned in the original Greek, against the English translation by A.D. Godley (1920), and the Latin version by J. Schweighaeuser (1824). The experiment proved successful: the student was able to recognize cognate words and match them with the corresponding Greek, and to use the knowledge of inflected languages to compare parts of speech between Latin and Greek (for example, to identify the accusative fratre-m based on the similar ending with the Ionic Greek ἀδελφεό-ν).</p>

<p>Undergraduate, Chinese native speaker, English as second language, no Ancient Greek. The student created a trilingual alignment of Euripides’ Bacchae, comparing the English translation by I. Johnson (<a href="http://jelks.nu/libri/classics/bacchae.html">http://jelks.nu/libri/classics/bacchae.html</a>) and a revised Chinese version based on the English (as there were no available Chinese translations of the original Greek). As a Chinese native speaker, the student used Chinese as a bridge to establish accurate correspondences between the English and the Ancient Greek words that had never been seen before. The result was an investigation into the meaning of Ancient Greek concepts through a meaningful comparison with similar Chinese terms, often with an emphasis on imperfect grammatical and semantic correspondences between the Greek and its translation (such as τὸ σοφόν, cleverness, translated as being clever).</p>
<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>
<p>At the end of the course all the students, no matter what level of mastery they had of the languages, developed an acute sense of how limited their understanding of the source text was from the translation, as much as the critical recognition that they could convey in-depth knowledge of critical cultural concepts expressed in the source language, by contrasting them with their modern language translation and investigating into their various meanings <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. The recognition of the limited capabilities of translation to efficiently convey concepts in Classical languages, while at first caused disappointment and criticism, convinced the students of the need to look more in depth into the original language to understand its inherent characteristics and the way it expressed ideas <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Students of the source language developed a tangible sense for the fluidity of translation by evaluating different strategies employed by professional scholars to approach complex phenomena; they systematically approached complex morphosyntactic constructs and were compelled to discuss their function and significance, while assessing the necessary imperfect character of any translation of them. In addition, students who were experimenting with learning a new modern language could approach unknown expressions and vocabulary by using their skills in other languages as a bridge to convey similar constructs.</p>
<p>One of the most relevant outcomes of this study was that students with no prior knowledge of the source language could start learning it by directly reading original literary texts. This approach could be revolutionary in the field of slow reading and language learning, and it also promises non-trivial consequences for passive users: readers with no knowledge of a source language could easily use already available alignments to perform a dynamic reading of the original aligned with its translation, gaining a basic understanding of vocabulary and syntax in the original.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and Future Work</h2>
<p>We hope to have shown the pedagogical potential of translation alignment. However, we are also aware that significant implementation needs to be pursued to improve some underdeveloped aspects and to allow a more systematic use of a translation alignment interface in teaching practices.</p>
<p>We recognize that at the moment the tool is open to every category of user, and the aligned pairs are partly the result of unsupervised work, which may affect the quality and consistency of the information collected in the database. The lack of a suitable evaluation/correction workflow not only makes the dataset not accurate enough for machine translation, but also prevents organic teacher supervision. Therefore, the integration of a voting system for the evaluation of the accuracy by teachers or expert users is one of the most needed implementations. A related problem is the current impossibility of working on collaborative projects, where multiple users can work together on the same corpus.</p>
<p>Secondly, not all translation pairs are equally useful as training data. We should expect alignment to produce conflicting, mutually exclusive, results: after all, translation alignment is the result of interpretation, and not all cases are easily classifiable as right or wrong. In some cases, typically literary texts, it is extremely difficult to establish perfect or even partial correspondences between expressions and concepts in potentially very different languages: we have found that, in lack of specific guidelines or gold standards for each single language pair, users tend to create their own set of rules to keep a consistent alignment strategy, but these rules tend to be very different according to the particular purpose of the alignment. Therefore, we need a system to filter translation pairs: an option would be to allow users to classify different kinds of translation pairs, for example distinguishing categories such as perfect/complete or partial/incomplete, and literal or free/poetical.</p>
<p>Finally, we recognize that immediate access to part-of-speech tagging and available word pairs while performing the alignment would enormously impact on the work of non-specialized users and students, and obviously on the improvement of analytical passive reading. This very desirable additional feature is also included in our future implementation.</p>

<p>A text and its translation or translations placed alongside are defined as parallel texts.

<p>The increased importance attached to virtual museums has transformed them into a major object of investigation, both in practice and in theory. In this context, this methodological and theory-driven paper asks whether and how digital and/or virtual museums could extend conventional and prevalent physical museum spaces. The paper argues that a virtual museum could serve as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of investigation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> , making special reference to the scholarly background of the disciplines of museology and digital humanities and investigating the specific characteristics of virtual museums.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the paper proposes that the digital virtual museum could extend conventional museum space by providing enhanced visitor experiences in terms of engagement and attraction. It investigates the manifold scholarly and practical impacts of extending the physical museum space into the virtual world from the theoretical perspectives of museology and digital humanities, as well as with respect to practical approaches that are necessary for museums and their visitors and users. In that context, the paper also relates to the relevance of virtual museums for museums and their visitors, especially in times of crisis, hence, particularly in times when those museums have to close their collections and exhibitions for various reasons, for example, in the current pandemic situation.</p>
<p>At least in the German speaking world, the term virtual museum has been subject of discussion since the 1990s, but is still awaiting a clear definition (see <a href="#schweibenz2016">Schweibenz [2016]</a>; <a href="#biedermann2017a">Biedermann [2017a]</a>; and <a href="#niewerth2020">Niewerth [2020]</a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  Recently, German speaking regions call for a digital museum, while the Anglophone world has argued in favour of a virtual museum, where both parties define a virtual museum as a digital entity. This digital entity summarises digital reproductions of museum objects<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  respectively, drawing on  “the characteristics of a museum, in order to complement, enhance, or augment the museum through personalization, interactivity, user experience and richness of content” <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> .</p>
<p>To answer the research question as to how digital or virtual museums should extend conventional museum space as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of investigation, the paper first focuses on the characteristics of recent digital or virtual museums, in order to find out how they engage with and attract museum visitors compared with physical museum space. In this context, the focus lies on the differences between, and similarities of, conventional and virtual museum spaces and refers to state-of-the-art museology and museum studies and digital humanities respectively.</p>
<p>Secondly, taking the previously mentioned into consideration, the paper sets out to achieve an understanding of a virtual museum and its characteristics against the backdrop of the responsible disciplines concerned with that field, especially from the perspective of general museology <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. General museology differs from other object-centred disciplines of the humanities as well as from the approach taken by museum studies in the way it defines its object of knowledge. Museology defines this as a special relationship of man to his environment, leading to the selection, preservation, interpretation and exhibition of meaningful objects. This relationship is also referred to as museality (see <a href="#stransky1971a">Stránský [1971a]</a>; and <a href="#biedermann2017b">Biedermann [2017b]</a>). From the perspective of ‘general museology’, museality is a supratemporal quality expressed differently in various times, its recent expression being the conventional or physical museum space of the institutional museum displaying museum objects physically to engage visitors.</p>
<p>Consequently, the paper presents perspectives in order to achieve an understanding of the virtual museum as extended museum space from the perspective of digital humanities <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, exploring strategies to digitally augment physical museum space. In this context, the paper draws on the approach taken by the University of Graz. Both disciplines are concerned with the topic of a virtual museum and, in that context, subsequently define the virtual museum as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of investigation with respect to the fundamental theoretical and practical aspects concerned.</p>
<p>On this basis, I also address the challenges of establishing a virtual museum, or museum (re)presentations in virtual space, as interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary objects of investigation, and I consider practical approaches to establishing a virtual museum.</p>
<p>Finally, the paper expounds on the relevant impacts of virtual museums with regard to the underlying research question as to how digital virtual museums could extend conventional and prevalent physical museum space. Impacts also include practical aspects of museum work as well as those relating to visitors and users. All these impacts are key to addressing new target groups, along with the crucial aspect that virtual museums can provide access to museum collections and their communication strategies even in times when museums have to close their doors to the public, for example, during the current Coronavirus crisis, which is just one of several possible scenarios.</p>
<p>In its conclusion, the paper subsumes the relevant research desiderata in the field, especially in terms of establishing a virtual museum as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field of application for the disciplines of general museology and digital humanities, finally also presenting a vision of what a virtual museum (considering the theoretical aspects in question) could look like.</p>
<h2 id="characterising-a-virtual-museum">Characterising a virtual museum</h2>
<p>At least in German speaking regions, the term virtual museum has been controversially discussed since the 1990s <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, thus challenging the well-established museum definition proposed by the International Council of Museums (ICOM)<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> . The ICOM’s museum definition refers to physical museums’ objects as being selected, preserved, interpreted and exhibited. Concerning virtual museums, sceptics have argued for physical museum space and physical engagement with the real object, which cannot be virtualised and thus substituted by a digital one, just as virtual restaurants cannot serve a real meal. From that perspective, virtualising physical museum space would also mean virtualising the actual creative and physical encounter between people of the present and authentic witnesses of the past. This assumption posits that the museum visitor’s encounter with the physical world cannot be transposed to the virtual world. That is the reason why virtual museum was interpreted as an oxymoron term.</p>
<p>Finally, a methodological expedient defines representations of museum collections in virtual space and the originating e-tangibles (see <a href="#parry2007">Parry [2007] 68</a>) as additional forms of museum communication that neither substitute nor compete with the real and physical museum, but rather address various other communication needs of visitors (see <a href="#beidermann2017a">Biedermann [2017a]</a>).</p>
<p>While German-speaking regions call for a digital museum, the Anglophone world argues in favour of the term virtual museum. However, both define it as a digital entity which summarises digital reproductions of museum objects (see Wikipedia)<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  and  “draws on the characteristics of a museum, in order to complement, enhance, or augment the museum through personalization, interactivity, user experience and richness of content” <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> .</p>
<p>Recent digital entities that summarise digital reproductions of museum objects<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  appear specifically as museum online databases or web portals. Consequently, many museums are digitising, or have already digitised their collections systematically, and their visitors have access to considerably more museum objects via the world wide web than was the case only a few years ago. Basically, they draw on museum collections and museum object data digitally enriched and represented in various forms in the virtual space. They appear as museum databases providing open access to museum object data and digital images of museum objects, as well as digital online exhibitions focusing on various topics.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  Additionally, various web portals serve as open access meta-databases (see web portal Europeana<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> ; web portal Deutsche digitale Bibliothek<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> ). In that context, semantic web technologies and digital museum standards are significant for museums (see LIDO<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  and CIDOC-CRM<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> ). Standards for museum vocabularies are in progress (museumvok;<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  Getty Arts &amp; Architecture Thesaurus<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> ). Moreover, museum websites, newsletters, social media outlets, and digital forms of museum communication now reflect a rather modified perspective and method in the visitor’s perception and therefore extend conventional museum space to encompass modified space.</p>
<p>Additionally, digital museum features enhance conventional museum space by means of augmented and virtual reality. Augmented reality can present  “some of the untold stories behind one of the museum’s most iconic collections”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, by giving insight into hidden paint layers <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> or how animals could have seen the basis of their  “skin and bones”  (National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution).<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  Augmented reality can also bring specimens to life <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Conversely, virtual museum space also integrates tools to augment museal reality, whereby virtual museums, galleries and cultural heritage tours can all complement, enhance and augment conventional museum space, especially through interactivity and user experience.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, 3D techniques expand the field of digital museum features in virtual space by 3D scanning of objects. These scans create virtual copies of museum objects that serve the purpose of digitally turning the object or zooming in, which is not possible in the case of original museum objects. 3D prints of these objects enhance the user experience in physical museum space, because of the possibility to touch and handle them. Virtual museum space also provides online access to 3D copies of museum objects<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  and to 3D tours of conventional museum space. This is why applied 3D techniques also broadly augment conventional museum space by immersive methods and provide a virtual reality to enable manifold possibilities of interactive visitor engagement (see <a href="#carrozzino2010">Carrozzino and Bergamasco [2010]</a>).</p>
<h2 id="virtualising-museums-from-the-perspective-of-museology">Virtualising museums from the perspective of museology</h2>
<p>Prevalent conventional physical museums operate in the interest of classical museology and its object of investigation, which is known as museality <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Museality is a  “relation between man and his reality by which he realises and decides in accordance with society which parts of the surrounding natural and arranged world are able to act as witnesses to this reality and are thus worthy to be systematised, researched, mediated and traded as bearers of this relation”   <sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  Currently, the conventional museum still dominates scientific discourse relating to museum documentation and presentation.</p>
<p>According to the theory of museality, to give just one example, the vehicle in which heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie were assassinated on 28th June 1914, is an authentic witness of this event. It is a Gräf &amp; Stift Double Phaeton car, which is currently on display at the Museum of Military History in Vienna (Heeresgeschichtliches Museum Vienna). That vehicle bears witness to the event that triggered the outbreak of the First World War; it has a special function as an object of memory concerning the persons involved – especially the murdered heir to the throne and his wife. At the same time, the object is emblematic – it symbolises the outbreak of WWI. Hence, it serves as a bearer of museality and possesses effective legitimacy to act as a museum object. Needless to say, this artefact could transport many more stories than the one mentioned above (see also Heeresgeschichtliches Museum Vienna).<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  Nevertheless, the intrinsic aim, goal and purpose of any conventional museum space – as the display showing the Archduke’s vehicle exemplifies – is the actual creative encounter between a present-day person and an authentic object of history.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, from the perspective of museology it is a central and defining point that museum objects can serve as authentic witnesses of an event or a process. Moreover, they relate to persons, dates and places, and therefore, the object is an item of evidence for something or somebody. A scientific and hermeneutical process verifies this evidence and defines an object as bearer of museality. At the same time, this object becomes a  “nouophor”  – a bearer of sense and meaning <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. The unique aspect of the concept museality lies in its time independence, which means that it appears independent of time by changing forms of its expression. Consequently, it deserves a mirror of historical circumstances. At the same time, museality determines the object of interest as part of the discipline museology and defines museology as belonging to the humanities (see <a href="#biedermann2017b">Biedermann [2017b]</a>).</p>
<p>Museology focuses on objects as sources and acts from a meta-perspective in terms of other object-centred disciplines of the humanities (such as art history, ethnology or archaeology) and natural sciences (such as geology, zoology, physics and so on). The objects thus act as evidence for various events and are especially significant – both with regard to their materiality <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> and symbolic meaning <sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. As a result, objects are able to tell numerous stories depending on the focus of the display and the storytelling.</p>
<p>Both the approaches of museology and museum studies focus on questions of digitising and virtualising forms of museum communication (see <a href="#parry2010">Parry [2010]</a>; <a href="#hoptman1994">Hoptman [1994]</a>; <a href="#langner2015">Langner [2015]</a>; <a href="#navarrete2016">Navarrete and Owen [2016]</a>; <a href="#whitelaw2015">Whitelaw [2015]</a>). In that context, they reflect the claim to authenticity of conventional museum spaces (see <a href="#parry2007">Parry [2007]</a>).</p>
<p>However, amongst other examples, the digital presentation of the Archduke’s vehicle shows that forms of digital presentations are generally becoming more important for conventional museums, which have been enlarging their digitisation and virtualisation programmes for many years.</p>
<h2 id="virtualising-museums-from-the-perspective-of-the-digital-humanities">Virtualising museums from the perspective of the digital humanities</h2>
<p>Particularly in German speaking regions, research in the field of digital humanities focuses on the information content of humanistic sources and primarily on modelling that content. Basically, this means describing and managing as well as visualising (meta)data by means of information transformation and exchange for the purpose of information intercommunication (see <a href="#arthur2014">Arthur and Bode [2014]</a>; <a href="#buttcher2016">Büttcher, Clarke and La Cormack [2016]</a>; <a href="#cartner2013">Cartner [2013]</a>; <a href="#jannidis2017">Jannidis, Kohle and Rehbein [2017]</a>; <a href="#kurz2015">Kurz [2015]</a>; <a href="#schreibmann2016">Schreibmann and Siemens [2016]</a>; <a href="#terras2013">Terras, Nyhan and Vanhoutte [2013]</a>).</p>
<p>Hence, in the German language-related context outlined above, the field of digital humanities is also beginning to highlight the museum as object of investigation (see <a href="#rehbein2019">Rehbein and Kunze [2019]</a>) with a focus on digitising, enriching, standardising, formalising and contextualising museum object data. Moreover, digital humanities are supporting the discipline of museum presentation by using visualising techniques and offering open access to relevant data, which broadens the field to address new research questions.</p>
<p>This approach applies digital standards of museum object documentation such as LIDO, which is compliant to the CIDOC-CRM.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  The University of Graz’s approach in this area is to transform and to visualise the data in the university’s asset management system, named GAMS<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> .</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, digital humanities’ projects have recently developed virtual museums which show special rooms.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  Various other institutions have realised projects related to virtual museums, such as using the example of dictionaries.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  Currently, several research focuses pursued by various universities are on objects and cultural heritage.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  Other projects focus on the digitisation of cultural heritage (project Zafar)<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  and 3D reconstructions using virtual research infrastructures (for example, using castles in Prussia).<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  The digital humanities systematise various interpretations of 3D copies, and reconstructions are also a matter of interest (see <a href="#munster2016">Münster [2016]</a>). In this context, the technique of photogrammetry plays an important role in 3D scanning and copying museum objects. The University of Graz, which plays no small role in those pioneering achievements, has designed an online platform as a  “virtual museum”  for its digitised object collections on GAMS – an asset management system for the humanities (GAMS virtual museum;<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>   <a href="#stigler2017">Stigler and Steiner [2017]</a>). In that way, the object of study of digital humanities is gradually extending from text sources to cultural heritage and historical objects within the interior and exterior museum space (see <a href="#reisinger2013">Reisinger [2013]</a>; see also the project DiTAH).<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup></p>
<p>The University of Graz’s approach in the context of digital humanities is based on semantic annotation, processing for tagging and analysing texts realised by special, almost XML-based standards (such as TEI – Text Encoding Initiative),<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  as well as visualising structured content by means of serialisations (such as XML, RDFa or JSON-LD).<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  In this approach, controlled vocabularies use knowledge systems to structure information, and subsequently to exchange data (for example, RDF, SKOS and OWL).<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  These technologies enrich the semantic web as  “open linked data”  (see <a href="#berners-lee2006">Berners-Lee [2006]</a>). Annotated and structured data therefore provide the basis to generate new research questions. The structured data is then transformed (supported by XSLT)<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  and thus prepared for presentation (supported by XSLT-FO;<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  see Institut für Dokumentologie und Editorik;<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  see <a href="#sahle2013">Sahle [2013]</a>). In that way, special aspects of combined data<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  can be addressed<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  to make them generally and easily accessible (see <a href="#perstling2013">Perstling [2013]</a>; <a href="#thaller2013">Thaller [2013]</a>; <a href="#vogeler2005">Vogeler [2005]</a>).</p>
<p>Digital humanities are also seeking for solutions to facilitate long-term archiving (see <a href="#thaller2013">Thaller [2013]</a>) and long-lasting access to cultural heritage data in form of digital research infrastructures (see GAMS<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup> , WissKI<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  and the project  “Objekte im Netz” ).<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup></p>
<p>More recently, digital humanities have started to focus not only on 3D techniques like photogrammetry and 3D scanning of museum objects and cultural heritage sites, but on augmented reality as well. The project titled  “Virtual Museum of the Archaeological Collection”  at the University of Graz is an example of this. As part of this project, both the objects and historical exhibition space are documented with the aid of 3D techniques ( “virtual museum of the archaeological collection” <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> ).</p>
<h2 id="virtual-museums-as-an-interdisciplinary-and-transdisciplinary-object-of-investigation-and-extended-museum-space">Virtual Museums as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of investigation and extended museum space</h2>
<p>Virtualising physical museum space has effects on conventional museums, especially in terms of their presentation and communication strategies. The focus of museum communication always lies on the audience as a major subject of interest, as well as on digital forms of museum communication. At the same time, those digital processes and projects mentioned above are in the process of modifying conventional museum space and transferring communication strategies to the digital and/or virtual world as a kind of  “public museum ecosystem”   <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. Neither the conventional museum space nor its modified counterpart correspond to virtual space, as they generate two different kinds of perception. Consequently, the experience of physical space in conventional museums, which a virtual museum obviously lacks, needs to be configured to serve as an extended museum experience in virtual space – and vice versa.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the virtual museum requires extended methods based on the theory of classical museology and on digital humanities to define tasks for and impacts of museums in the virtual space. From a scientific point of view, these new challenges give rise to an interdisciplinary field in the discourse between the poles of museology and digital humanities and information technologies respectively. The question of characteristics and criteria of virtual museums are thus becoming a mutually transdisciplinary object of investigation within current discourse, which needs to be viewed against the backdrop of current projects and with regard to state-of-the-art virtual museums.</p>
<p>While debating on a virtual museum within an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discourse between the poles of digital humanities and museology, it is vital to understand the particular characteristics of museum objects, as opposed to texts. From a museological perspective, texts are documents of the mind and especially determined by the content of information they transfer <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. By contrast, a museum object is a singular man-made artefact or a selected natural object, a semiophor, or bearer of symbols (see <a href="#pomian1988">Pomian [1988]</a>), and more explicitly – as already mentioned – as a nouophor <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>, or bearer of sense and meaning. The value of a museum object is thus inextricably linked to its context information and its special object history. Hence, it is determined by the extent of its documented ‘object biography’. Museum documentation thereby defines an object, not only in terms of its materiality – by way of primary documentation (see <a href="#waidacher1999b">Waidacher [1999b]</a>), but also in terms of being a material witness concerning special events or circumstances – by way of secondary documentation <sup id="fnref1:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>, which also refers to the immaterial aspects of museum objects to be documented.</p>
<p>In this context, the question arises of how to characterise a virtual museum and how to define its appearance from an interdisciplinary point of view. The interdisciplinary challenge is therefore to bridge the gap between real and virtual museum spaces, but not by substituting one for the other through simulation, comparable with Plato’s allegory of the cave. Conversely, a video call suffices to interconnect and transfer information but is not able to substitute a physical encounter – as aptly demonstrated and emotively experienced during the ongoing recent Coronavirus crisis. After all, a photograph or hologram is not a physically present person, but merely a (virtual) representation of that person. The challenges concerning authenticity and space are obviously central to this discourse.</p>
<p>In that sense, several research questions arise from the perspective of digital humanities. The challenges to be faced in this regard concern the extension of conventional museum space into virtual space by enabling an enhanced visitor experience. This enhanced experience is created by communicating the specialities of the institution museum, which is grounded in the museum object as a bearer of sense and meaning and as an expression of museality. This is precisely why the basic objective of virtualising physical museum space is to communicate museum objects, (hidden) (hi)stories and contexts by using methods and tools of digital humanities in a way that conventional museums are not able to.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the challenges of digital humanities regarding a virtual museum first of all face the processes of modelling the object metadata for presentation and visualisation in physical as well as virtual spaces. From the perspective of museology, these challenges refer to the circulation of museum objects within the process of documenting or collecting metadata. This process corresponds to registering, making an inventory and cataloguing the items as well as collecting data relating to the entire object history in the context of ‘biography’, including the immaterial aspects of the museum object. From the perspective of applied museology, these processes are operated by a museum management system, for example, a database. As regards digital methods, this means information modelling, describing, standardising and formalising metadata, as well as managing and ordering knowledge.</p>
<p>Collecting the basic data of museum objects – from a museological perspective, the so-called primary documentation – means to register data that refers to the materiality of the object, such as its material, form, technique, measurements and so on. Primary documentation also means gathering information in terms of primary events to which the object is linked, such as producers, developers, artists and users as historic subjects. Museum curators, exhibit designers and museum staff act as a museum’s instance which corresponds in most classic museum spaces to the museum’s interpretational sovereignty from a scientific point of view. In a further step, all of the gathered data is modelled and describes the objects and the object data as metadata. All in all, digital methods are used to manage and order knowledge.</p>
<p>Museum documentation also collects data relating to dates and place names of objects. To again cite the example of Franz-Ferdinand’s motorcar, the 28th June 1914 is a relevant date that is primarily associated with this object. However, it is also related to the 15th December 1919, the date on which the owner of the object, Count Harrach, a friend of the Imperial Family, donated this vehicle to the heir to the throne.</p>
<p>In the context of structuring object data in a logical order, various challenges concerning the standardisation of data can arise. Art historians often use the term indeed or probably to express the time ‘around 1900’ to which an object is related. However, this classification is unreadable for machines because they need relatively accurate dates to process the data. To render date-related data machine-readable, and thus traceable, using search engines, the curators have to define concrete dates according to documentation guidelines, for example instead of indeed around 1900 they use 1895 as the earliest and 1905 as the latest date of production. Specifying information, of course, goes hand in hand with the hermeneutical process of researching object biographies. Consequently, such documentation guidelines should be used for an entire collection and virtual museum respectively.</p>
<p>The secondary documentation process collects data describing the object as a bearer of sense and meaning, as a nouophor and an expression of museality. This results from the hermeneutic process of investigating an object as an expression of museality and describes the object from a synchronic as well as a diachronic perspective. Consequently, an object can have associations, for instance, to birth, baptism, marriage, death or – like the vehicle described – to assassination and war. In addition, the vehicle plays an important role in the discourse of memory culture as well as in the context of the recent commemoration of the outbreak and end of World War I and their anniversaries (1914/18-2014/18).</p>
<p>Furthermore, objects have relations to museum-related administrative workflows such as loans, conservation activities and displays, which is primarily relevant to collection management. These basic and deepened object data, which are the results of primary and secondary documentation, build the foundation for visualisations in virtual space (for example managed by digital transformations, like XSLT<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> ).</p>
<p>The first step in collecting data is managed by surfaces of databases or repositories, or in the case of smaller museums or projects, by Excel spreadsheets or word templates. These templates are mapped to already existing XML-based museum documentation standards like LIDO or also to TEI by using transformations and with the help of special programmes and (open source) software (see Oxygen<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  and Oxgarage<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup> ). In terms of museum data, the digital humanities use the data harvesting standard LIDO<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>  which is compliant to the CIDOC-CRM,<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>  an ontology to describe museum objects referenced by events and properties. The digital research infrastructure WissKI is based on CIDOC-CRM ontology.<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup> WissKI is built as a graph database to manage primary research data and for special use in museum management systems.</p>
<p>Museum objects are especially relevant in terms of their meaning and the events and persons they bear witness to. Consequently, there are unlimited options of relations between objects and events, persons, times and places, just as in the case of categories which describe these object relations. This means enhancing controlled vocabulary by using museological criteria, which particularly requires the establishment of museological thesauri. Such thesauri form structured concepts of object meaning in systems of controlled vocabulary. The XML standard SKOS is one possible and useful digital standard (see SKOS)<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>  to map controlled vocabulary. SKOS categorises each concept by means of an identifier, which references the concept of the thesauri and contributes to representing the object meaning. By integrating these concepts into semantic web technologies (referring to SKOS), data is also accessible as linked open data, thereby enriching the semantic web.</p>
<p>Different categories of sources, like index cards and images can reveal the history or the biography of museum objects. They show the provenance of objects and parts of the stories stored in objects. Digital collection complexes in virtual space enable all this information to interlink and link to the object in a structured manner. In this way, visitors can enjoy a multi-perspective view of the unique object. This also applies to the open GLAM initiative (see Open GLAM)<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  and to the claim of open access to memory-related institutional data, in particular with regard to galleries, libraries, archives and museums.</p>
<p>Requirements for digital humanities not only apply to the workflow of museum documentation, but also to the presentation method. To exemplify the University of Graz’s digital humanities approach, transformations of modelled data form the basis for data visualisations realised by XSLT-stylesheets, which support data output in various forms and formats (like PDF, XHTML, SVG, SMIL)<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>  also at least printed on paper. These transformations map collected data on webpages, for example, and in terms of databases, interfaces are provided to support web presentations. These presentations map object biographies by linking objects to their metadata, to images and additional context information, and provide multi-perspective access to view the items. In this way, it is possible to create undreamt-of links to objects and collections which are not displayed or displayable, or which are dislocated, taking account of their very specific relations.</p>
<p>In contrast to the medium text, which, from the perspective of digital humanities, often requires the separation of form and content <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>, the museum object calls for concentration on the single authentic object in combination with its metadata to which the object is intrinsically linked. As regards virtual museums, the aspect of museum documentation or data gathering is of special importance due to the need to build a basis for all other virtual communication strategies of digital storytelling, 3D techniques and augmented reality. On the basis of museum documentation, the object requires special tools to manage story-telling in order to offer narratives. Virtual space enables objects to be brought together, which for various museological reasons cannot be displayed (together) in conventional museum space. In addition, virtual museum presentations provide narrative access to objects on virtual guided tours, also giving narrative approaches to museum objects by linking object data, images and various groups of objects. The digital humanities, and in this context, informatics, thus also develop tools for the presentation of virtual guided tours (see: e.g. StoryMapJS).<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup></p>
<p>In the digital museum age, digital images which include metadata standards to describe and deliver images (see III-F)<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>  are state-of-the-art. High-resolution images allow users to zoom in on a virtual object, which would not be possible in physical museum space. In order to do that, digital humanities use the standard III-F.</p>
<p>The use of 3D-techniques in particular can bring new insights to the investigation of materiality and object biographies, which can be useful in a certain way, both for research purposes and for communicating objects. Special tools not only support zoom factors for high-resolution images, but also 3D object data. Such tools need to include an audio response, multimedia offers and 3D animations based on 3D scans to consequently augment conventional museum reality to extended forms of museum presentation in today’s digital age. Various different surfaces and responsibly designed media allow visitors to access museum data using various forms of output mediums.</p>
<p>Such tools can also contribute to engaging visitor attention <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>, because of the greater mental effort involved in browsing through object stories of one’s own accord, additionally supported, for instance, by audio and image animations, 3D-object visualisations and virtual guided tours in online exhibitions and – vice versa – in physical museum space as well.</p>
<p>As regards physical museum space, all of these tools can help combine object biographies and the context information of objects in accordance with the visitor’s personal interests and needs. For that purpose, digital media used in the classic museum space can complement conventional museum labels. Extending conventional museum spaces by means of digital technologies can be achieved in displays using replicas printed in 3D. These replicas address groups of visitors, such as children, who perceive certain effects by touching the 3D copies and experience these objects in that particular mode of perception. Moreover, the aspect of augmented reality can enhance visitor experiences of museum objects by using immersive technologies that involve the visitors in the content.</p>
<p>Immersive methods (see <a href="#dowling2019">Dowling [2019]</a>) are a means of special communication also used in physical museum exhibitions to engage in a narrative or storytelling process, thus provoking a condition of flow. This status can also be evoked in the virtual world by means of various tools, offering, for example, digital storytelling using augmented reality methods (for technical implementation, see <a href="#yuan2019">Yuan [2019]</a>).</p>
<h2 id="impacts-of-virtual-museums">Impacts of virtual museums</h2>
<p>All of these possibilities of linking and enriching the web with museum object metadata also serve the purpose of extending conventional and modified museum space to create a kind of  “public museum ecosystem”   <sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>, and hence to offer extended visitor and user experiences in the virtual space. Conversely, conventional museum space is able to integrate virtual museum experiences such as 3D techniques and augmented reality. However, in that way a museum representation in virtual space can rely on the extended space of museal experience. As a result, the extended museum space of a virtual museum has manifold impacts in terms of museology, digital humanities, museums and visitors.</p>
<p>In terms of museology, virtual museum space serves to extend conventional physical museum space in multiple ways: by enriching museum object data digitally, communicating with visitors with the help of social media, offering access to digital object databases and online exhibitions, or providing 3D views on objects in the virtual world. Furthermore, an extended conventional museum space virtually maps manifold object data and their stories, such as museum object-related contextual information. It communicates narratives and relationships of and between museum objects and collections. A virtual museum integrates various forms of communication used within physical museum space, such as guided tours, lectures and presentations offered by museum staff, thus augmenting conventional museum space by using its own 3D views. Also, a virtual museum represents the classic museum space three-dimensionally and links all possible museum object stories, images, 3D views, and storytelling tools to provide users with a virtual reality-assisted museum space based on museum objects and their relations to society, which always build the point of reference. Against this backdrop, it becomes clear that virtual museum reality strives to extend the theoretical approach of general museology into virtual space, as well as clarify aspects of authenticity and space to which a museum object is linked.</p>
<p>In terms of digital humanities, standards in museum object documentation and data enriching need to be extended by including museological aspects. Furthermore, a virtual museum uses a wide array of (immersive) digital methods and tools for special visualisation requirements which need to be further developed as regards the aspect of museology. Impacts for digital humanities or informatics also concern data storage and the provision of access to object data. Establishing a virtual museum means storing a large amount of data in terms of high-resolution images, videos or 3D copies as well. It must be able to support the process of dealing with complex user queries concerning various knowledge systems and object stories. On this basis, it is possible to manage complex collection analyses with reference to the uniqueness of museum objects.</p>
<p>An issue that goes hand in hand with that is the amount of time needed to load data and to process complex queries, which can influence visitor behaviour when browsing through the collections, and subsequently also the decision and will to visit a conventional museum. Managing personal and institutional data as well as image data, which involves applying for special licences, are hard facts (see Creative Commons licences).<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup></p>
<p>As a result, visitors and users browse through virtual museum space, selecting and experiencing museum object reproductions, virtually combined with manifold museum object information, context data and storytelling narratives. Users gain virtual access to the aspect of authenticity of museum objects, which means linking up objects and object data, and depicting and representing object relations related to a specific relevant event, to which an object bears witness. This access is independent of opening hours and physical accessibility, and at the same time, it does not replace the original object’s authenticity.</p>
<p>The aspect of open access to museum collections in the form of a virtual museum reality is of special relevance in times of crisis, which the ongoing recent global Coronavirus crisis has clearly shown, as long as users have access to the internet. International museum organisations have requested museums to enlarge their digital communication strategies to provide museum visitors with information about their collections. For example, UMAC (the international committee for university museums and collections in the context of ICOM international) provided webinars to the professional university museum community to enable discussion on the impacts of the lockdown especially for university museums (UMAC ICOM).<sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>  One year on, many initiatives have found their way to various users, such as the virtual museum of the University of Cantabria (Luis Quintanilla, Art and Memory).<sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup></p>
<p>Consequently, it is of great importance to mention the manifold effects this has had on museums. Museums can use a virtual museum as a tool to communicate museum object data, context information, storytelling and narratives, in order to provide access to their collections, which is crucial for museums in times of crisis, as the Coronavirus crisis has revealed. Museums can grant access to their collections even in times of official administrative closures, in times of war or at any other time when museums are forced to close their collections to the public. Moreover, in terms of the (military) destruction of museum objects or attacks in areas of conflict, virtual museum space could enable access to museum object and collection data, and at the same time facilitate (at least) digital preservation. Even in times of a long-term shutdown and museum closures, exemplified by the present Coronavirus crisis, which is only one of various other options, virtual museum space has manifold effects on museum employees. As a research infrastructure, virtual museums could grant online access to museum employees to enable them to work from home on their museum communication projects. Additionally, a virtual museum could provide virtual visits to the museum, such as a digital video call, to complement the personal encounter. Conversely, all of these tools can influence the attractiveness of the real and physical encounter in times of physical visiting. By integrating these tools into physical museum presentations, they could help to deepen museum communication between museums and their visitors within physical museum space.</p>
<p>Of course, museums are challenged in times of crisis, especially with a view to heavy losses of entrance fees. On the other hand, museums would be obliged to consider concepts of gaining money by visiting virtual museums like other providers of digital services do. As the Coronavirus crisis has shown, the Internet and online possibilities have played an enormous social role in terms of replacing physical interactions between persons in order to phone, shop, to obtain medical attendance, schooling and university teaching, to access online sports programmes offered by local fitness gyms, and to enable museums and visitors to communicate with each other. However, none of these tools are able to replace real experiences or physical encounters – both mediums are different and aim to serve different manners of perception. These digital tools were a time-limited possibility due to the necessity of physical distancing. What the crisis has also shown is that some target groups were focused on the virtual world and perfectly happy to consume digital and virtual offers. For museums though, it is possibly interesting to note that some non-museum visitor target groups were much more attracted to digital museum features than to physical museum spaces. It is against this specific backdrop that museums should consider which impact a virtual museum can have on the audience and how museums can benefit from those effects.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The virtual museum refers especially to the processes of collecting, gathering, structuring and visualising data of museum objects or rather of the cultural heritage. This means to manage data, reference objects to scientific knowledge systems, map the information to XML-standards, visualise information and provide access to objects that are linked to their appropriate metadata and context information. For a standardised museum documentation process, a museum database providing all the needs of the digital humanities and of museology is essential, as the use of Excel spreadsheets or Word templates have turned out to be impractical for museum work.</p>
<p>The aim of a virtual museum is therefore to ensure that all visualisations take object biographies into account and that they link data to the very uniqueness of the objects and their relations in order to present a multi-layered view of those objects. In addition, virtual museums should also seek to impart narratives and thus address visitors emotionally in both the virtual and conventional museum space. This is done by integrating digital and immersive tools and methods in the process of representing conventional museum space in the virtual world. The extension of conventional museums into virtual space thus results in an interesting and attractive space where the joy of discovery is possible in an extended museum experience.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to point out that despite all of the impacts a virtual museum may have, it is definitely a challenge to implement it. In that sense, the digital museum documentation standards mentioned above have many advantages in terms of data harvesting, but the process of modelling and mapping the data is a very complex and time-consuming one. For the practical museum documentation process, it is of special importance that a database is able to fulfil all of the purposes of recording data, processing and linking information. Currently, the only digital infrastructure available is WissKI which can fulfil all the requirements mentioned above, in accordance with the international museum documentation standard CIDOC CRM. However, that gap between theory and practice can be bridged by exploring the virtual museum as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field of investigation.</p>
<p>This approach to virtual museums as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of investigation in the extended virtual museum space specifies further research desiderata specifically linked to the digital world. These desiderata address visitor studies and types of visitor behaviour in virtual space, for example, surfing and consumer behaviour, and questions as to which contents visitors would like to experience or even if they would be willing to spend money on visiting virtual museums.</p>
<p>Evaluations of classic museum spaces showing their effectivity need to be extended to the virtual museum to question their ability to affect and to engage visitor attention. Methods used by empirical social studies such as psychology and communication sciences are thus combined with computer-supported methods and analyses such as eye-tracking.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a virtual museum space provides manifold potential for museology and digital humanities to extend interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary methods and offers multiple impacts for museums and visitors to improve their presentation and communication strategies, not only in times of crisis. One important factor is that virtual museums are also able to target new groups of visitors and users, which would have to be investigated in detail in terms of their special needs.</p>
<p>Until these requirements of virtual museums are achieved using interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary methods, the virtual museum will remain a gedankenexperiment, an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary object of investigation.</p>

<p>The DiTAH project (Digital Transformation in Austrian Humanities) focuses on the infrastructure and the tools and methods needed to transfer research data to the public. In this context, cultural heritage data also plays an important role.

In the last decades the process of image scanning, transcription and creation of digital archives of text has materialized, but many scholars aren&rsquo;t conscious of the results it can achieve for their studies. For that reason, Analysis of Ancient and Medieval Texts and Manuscripts: Digital Approaches aims to show the possibilities given by computer-assisted methods in the analysis of ancient and medieval codices. In particular, there is a focus on the combination and comparison of data, which can lead to better results than in the past. Even if the publication dates to 2014 and in these last few years the research has improved, the volume is an important instrument to explore the world of digital humanities and its potential contributions to research. The book is divided into five sections – each of them dedicated to a certain aspect of manuscripts’ analysis. As explained in the acknowledgements, the articles contained in this compiled volume were presented in a workshop organized on April 2-3 2012 in Leuven and Brussels.</p>
<p>The four essays of the first section,  “Stemmatology,”  recognize the importance of computer-assisted methods, but suggest combining them with the classical approach elaborated by Karl Lachmann and Paul Maas. The first article, by Tuomas Heikkilä, shows the results of using six algorithms to know the textual tradition of the first ten chapters of the Vita et miracula s. Symeonis: RHM, Semstem, R&amp;B, MP, NJ and NeighborNet. All the algorithms revealed three large groups which correspond to the preliminary grouping based on Lachmannian-Maasian method, but there are some difficulties with contamination of the text. The same problem occurs in the following article by Philipp Roelli, who analyzed Petrus Alfonsi’s  <em>Dialogus</em>  and recognized that the algorithm had not been able to distinguish many  <em>Leitfehler</em>  (or  <em>errores significativi</em> ).</p>
<p>The third and the fourth essays illustrate similar studies, with the purpose  “to extend philology through the aid of the computer”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>: Jean-Baptiste Camps and Florian Cafiero applied the algorithm to Li Bestiaires d&rsquo;Amours of Richart de Fornival to create a stemma codicum and compare it with the true stemma; Alberto Cantera, meanwhile, analyzed the manuscripts of the Avestan corpus, with all the difficulties related to a text composed orally and transmitted in that way for a long time. We can say, based on their experiments, that the computer-assisted method has the advantage of saving time during the analysis, but it still needs improvement: therefore the suggestion is to combine it with the classical approach, as they compensate each other. In fact, they use the same material and the same principles, but in a different way and with different achievements. So we stand to benefit from the possibilities that the two approaches offer, promising the same result in the study of a document in the future.</p>

</figure>
<p>The second section,  “Statistics and Stylistics,”  comprises three articles referring to the application of statistical methods in analysis of a text. The first one, by Armin Hoenen, illustrates the experiment of producing an artificial tradition by using an algorithm (ATG), in order to develop a potent stemmatology. The algorithm, as if it was a copyist, has analyzed an input manuscript and introduced several letter changes to the copy it has produced, with the purpose being to get an output corpus similar to real corpora. This study is only the first step, but it has revealed that copyists tended to make mistakes for several reasons, not only for the resemblance of the letters: in fact there are other influencing factors like their proficiency, mother tongue or concentration of the scribe. Just at the beginning, first results have referred to single letters, and next Hoenen wants to investigate the distribution of words and variants.</p>
<p>An interesting experiment is made by Karina van Dalen-Oskam and described in the second essay. Its aim was to consider Jacob van Maerlant’s  <em>Scolastica</em> , trying to distinguish the text edited by modern editors from the one transmitted by medieval codices. The results have shown the similarities between the two versions, which is not surprising, but can be useful to recognize the attitudes towards the texts. Therefore van Dalen-Oskam, referencing the article  “The Scribe as Editor”  by Elspeth Kennedy <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, notes that the experiment gives a not-very-convenient conclusion: the scribe is like an editor who made choices for the transmission, just as nineteenth-century and contemporary editors do. For this reason, in order to prepare new editions, we should be aware of the importance of scribes’ work, and not only of the text itself: recalling the title of a volume by Leighton D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, texts and transmission are two essentials elements for philological studies and the one necessarily implies the other <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The last article of this section is by Francesco Stella, with the collaboration of Luca Verticchio and Stefania Pennasilico. Considering the lexicon of epistolary corpora in Latin from the republican to the humanistic period (Cicero, Pliny the Younger, Augustine, Alcuin of York, Abelard and Petrarch), the study wanted to understand the historical development of the Latin language using the program Analisi lessicale. It permitted identifying the most frequent terms (et, in, non, est, ut), the empty terms (enim is one of the most used) or the variation of forms in the different authors analyzed, in order to make statistical conclusions. Starting from this experiment the hope is to deepen the relationships between diction and social-cultural communication, with the purpose to formulate a general hypothesis related to the literary language.</p>

<p>The third section,  “Intertextuality,”  focuses on the possibilities offered by several digital archives – important sources to analyze a text and its tradition. One of them is the project Musisque Deoque, dedicated to Latin poetry and described in the first essay by Linda Spinazzè. The digital archive is useful for specific researches towards the document, like filtering specific meters out or finding words in a particular position of the verse, but it also allows inserting a digital edition into the corpus. Therefore Spinazzè has shown the way to edit Maximianus’ elegiac work for Musisque Deoque, noting the possibility to read the critical apparatus, to interrogate variants and to get information related to a specific codex. Its instrument is the prototype for the creation of a cyberspace for classical literature, which represents the future of humanities with a collaboration between philology and technology.</p>
<p>The three following essays explore other digital archives, whose aims are similar to Musisque Deoque: Samuel Rubenson describes the database of the Apophthegmata Patrum, which is able to analyze at various levels the corpus of monastic fathers, with the possibility for a scholar to share his work on a text and to give an updated version of the text itself; Charlotte Tupman and Anna Jordanous talk about the Sharing Ancient Wisdoms (SAWS) project and several methods to link and share the relationship between one wisdom text and another; finally Maxim Romanov illustrates a way to study the Arabical sources by developing text-mining techniques, in order to extract information from a certain document thanks to metadata.</p>

<p>The fourth section,  “Script analysis,”  examines the importance of paleography on the study of ancient and medieval manuscripts. Just as philology, the discipline has advanced over the last few years of the digital revolution. In the first essay, Ainoa Castro Correa gives an overview of the paleographical problems to analyze a codex, referring in particular to several tools applied to the Visigothic script. After research in the archives, Castro Correa has created a database of the documentation from the early medieval history of Galicia in order to extract different information from each text: the signature, the type of writing and other notes that can be useful in the study of a codex. Castro Correa has also used Adobe Photoshop to develop analysis of the Visigothic script, because certain elements can be understood only with the use of an image. For this reason the author built a catalogue of graphic forms which included several aspects like the form of the letter or the abbreviations, and then compared all the images. That experiment has allowed the creation of a graphic profile by using metadata, which in the future can be considered the first step to study an ancient or a medieval document. There are obviously some difficulties to overcome – for example the script variations of a certain scribe – but we can be positive that in few years there could be a collaboration between the experienced paleographic eye and digital paleography.</p>
<p>The second essay of this section, by Eugenio R. Luján and Eduardo Orduña, explores the Hesperia databank of Palaeohispanic languages, which collect the inscriptions from the Iberian Peninsula, excepts for the ones in Latin, Greek and Phoenician. Therefore it is explained how to navigate in the database and what the possibilities are offered: it is possible to do researches in a text and see its variants, and also to look for lexical and bibliographical references by using specific entries.</p>

<p>The last section of the book,  “Codicology,”  refers to the manuscript itself, seen as the medium by which we know ancient and medieval literature. Its two articles show the collaboration between the discipline and the most recent technologies, in order to aid greatly the study of writing. The first one, by Ira Rabin, discusses the possibility to employ ink identification to create a database which could give more information during the analysis of a codex. After explaining the different types of ink (soot, plant, iron-gall and inks of a mixed composition), there is an overview of the analytic procedures which can be used to identify a certain ink: the Vibrational spectroscopy, the analysis by X-ray fluorescence technique, and the multi-color microscope.</p>
<p>The second article, by Patrick Andrist, starts with a question asked by the author to few colleagues:  “how important is it that the date of a manuscript is more or less correct?”   <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The date is obviously significant in cataloguing ancient texts, but we face difficulty in giving precise information. Accordingly Andrist illustrates several methods to prepare the online description of a document, like the mono-layer and bi-layer model which also permit one to understand the structure and the content of a codex.</p>

<p>The volume ends with an essay in which Joris J. Van Zundert discusses the methodological innovation of digital scholarly editions. Their aim is to collect and present a text in multiple visualizations, in order to illustrate all the necessary information of certain text. That can be achieved also by printed editions, but such tasks as indexing and bibliography are easier to access with the digital medium. Van Zundert also talks about two important capabilities of the digital codex: interactivity and processing. In fact, it is possible to edit, change or annotate a document based on his interpretation, which in a print text can be done only in the margins. The hope is that in the future we could improve the potential offered by the digital revolution and exceed its current limits. As Van Zundert says in conclusion,  “Thus we have a glass half full. Good, now let us fill it further”   <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>Analysis of Ancient and Medieval Texts and Manuscripts: Digital Approaches</em>  is an important source with which to understand how the digital revolution has changed, and also changes, the approach to literary studies. The essays of the volume express, in most cases, the first steps for the future development of collaborations between philology, paleography, codicology and the most recent technologies, with the assumption that many aspects still need to be improved. Even in six years much progress has been made because today classical studies work makes use of digital resources and cannot ignore their contribution to research.</p>
<p>We can therefore recall some of the most important project of these last years, like the ones developed by Monica Berti at the University of Leipzig: the Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (DHFG) and the Digital Athenaeus, which intend to provide a digital version of Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (FHG) and Athenaeus’ Deipnosophists and extract from these texts additional information not included in the print edition. A significant database is also Divination and Greek History (Archaic to Classical). Reassessing Greek Oracular Responses, created by Maurizio Giangiulio at the University of Trento: its aim is to edit, comment and translate Delphic literary responses, analyzing their narrative framing and collecting as many loci paralleli as possible. Another Italian project is Online Humanities Scholarship: A Digital Medical Library based on Ancient Texts by the University of Parma, which provides electronic editions of ancient medical sources (papyri, ostraca and tablets), with the possibility to examine texts, translations, commentary, metadata and images. To conclude, it is worth mentioning the project Iliadoscope, developed by David Bouvier and Ariane Jambé at the University of Lausanne: the intent is to visualize the  <em>Iliad</em> , its paraphrasis and scholia included in the Byzantine manuscript Genavensis 44, comparing the texts and searching for lexical correspondences. These are only few projects of the last few years, but they demonstrate how the computer-assisted methods are an essential source for humanities and their use will inevitably grow in the future. That is really an achievement.</p>

<h2 id="heading-1"></h2>
<p>Scholarship in digital textual studies often vacillates between two poles: the species of computational text analysis, sometimes called  “distant reading,”  occupy one pole, while text encoding and digital edition building, as might be characterized by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), occupy the other. For decades there have been calls for research that moves between these poles — for  “scalable”  or  “zoomable reading”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> — as well as research that locates itself emphatically in the continuum, such as Alison Booth&rsquo;s  “mid-range”  reading <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. In a 2013 conference dialogue, Julia Flanders and Matthew Jockers dreamed of methods that would  “mak[e] it possible to see both scale and detail simultaneously”  because  “micro and macro approaches are really two faces of the same thing.”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> We might even claim near-consensus among digital literary scholars that our research  <em>should</em>  bridge scales, and that the distant reading versus text encoding dichotomy is both intellectually and rhetorically impoverished. Nevertheless, in these repeated calls for a middle way we might also mark a lingering anxiety in the field that, however much we might wish for research that moves easily among analyses at different scales, in practice such movement is rare. Both practical obstacles of time and labor, as well as conceptual obstacles of commensurability, result in most projects unfolding largely at one scale or another.</p>
<p>In welcome contrast, Katherine Bode&rsquo;s  <em>A World of Fiction: Digital Collections and the Future of Literary History</em>  not only models how scholars might stage meaningful dialogue between scales of textual analysis, but also makes a forceful argument for the necessity of such work. The book ranges over a number of prominent computational methods, from quantitative data analysis to topic modeling to network analysis. Its heart, however, is the construction of  “a scholarly edition of a literary system”  which pairs a curated and annotated dataset of Australian newspaper fiction with a critical apparatus that  “elaborates the complex relationships between the historical context explored, the disciplinary infrastructure employed in investigating that context, the decisions and selections implicated in creating and remediating the collection or collections, and the transformations wrought by the editor&rsquo;s extraction, construction, and analysis of that data”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. In this vein,  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  comprises both a monograph exploring her findings about Australian newspaper fiction and an extensive  “curated dataset”  available for download or exploration at <a href="http://cdhrdatasys.anu.edu.au/tobecontinued/">http://cdhrdatasys.anu.edu.au/tobecontinued/</a>.</p>
<p>Like printed critical editions, Bode argues, a scholarly edition of a literary system  “presents an argument about the existence of literary works in the past based on the editor&rsquo;s interpretation of the multiple transactions by which documentary evidence of the past is transmitted to the present”   <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Bode&rsquo;s edition, for instance, seeks to capture the shifting elements of fiction as it moved through the Australian press, such as changing titles and varying authorship attributions so that relationships among witnesses are visible and available for analysis <sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. In theorizing her computational work in book historical and bibliographic terms, Bode accomplishes something both transformative and refreshingly modest, demonstrating how computational or algorithmic models relate to the hypotheses underlying the work of all edition building, digital or not. The resulting book states its arguments and interventions plainly, while exposing its underlying evidence in an accessible interface, so that other scholars can verify, extend, or challenge Bode&rsquo;s findings. Though  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  declares its ambition  “to advance a noncanonical, data-rich, and transnational history of the literary, publishing, and reading cultures of nineteenth-century Australia”   <sup id="fnref3:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> it is modest insofar as it refuses the rhetorical excesses that can attend other data-rich humanities projects, insisting instead on the createdness of its data and the situatedness of its findings.</p>
<p>Bode establishes the urgency of her approach in  <em>A World of Fiction</em> &rsquo;s first chapter, which critiques the work of previous cornerstone books in computational text analysis: Franco Moretti&rsquo;s  <em>Distant Reading</em>  and  <em>Graphs, Maps, Trees</em>  and Jockers&rsquo;s  <em>Macroanalysis</em> . Bode rejects the idea that the methods labeled  “distant reading”  or  “macroanalysis”  should be understood as opposites to close reading. Instead, she argues that both distant and close reading  “are united by a common neglect of textual scholarship,”  and  “cannot benefit from the historical insights presented by editorial and bibliographic productions.”  By  “conceiving data and computation as providing direct access to the literary-historical record”  such scholarship ends up  “offer[ing] ahistorical arguments about the existence and interconnections of literary works in the past”   <sup id="fnref4:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Bode analyzes such oversights in detail, but in brief overview, she critiques the way such studies discuss the composition of their corpora (what they include and, most importantly, what they do not); the ways in which metadata can mislead (a single publication date, for instance, often obscures a more complex production history); or the ways such datasets elide broader publication contexts (the older books still on the market in a given moment, for instance, or parallel periodical publications). Bode takes particular issue with the assumption underlying many distant reading analyses that the date of work&rsquo;s first publication provides the most meaningful datapoint for modeling literary influence  “in a chronologically discrete manner, regardless of the actual conduits of literary influence, which require availability to readers who buy, borrow, and sometimes write literary works”   <sup id="fnref5:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. In arguing that distant and close reading are similarly ahistorical in orientation, Bode begins  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  with a striking and important claim. Taking that claim seriously would require practitioners of computational text analysis to pay more than lip service to the work of archive and collection construction, which Bode attempts to model in the following chapters.</p>
<h2 id="fact-and-fiction-in-news-archives">Fact and Fiction in News Archives</h2>
<p>In chapter 3, Bode establishes the centrality of newspapers to the publication and circulation of fiction in nineteenth-century colonial Australia; it was not one medium for fiction, but the predominant medium. Thus  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  asserts that its claims about newspaper fiction can be understood as claims about fiction in the region more broadly, more so than would be the case in a discussion of Britain or America in the same period. By relying on newspapers, Bode demonstrates her commitment to grounding  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  not only in the messy historical medium in which readers would have encountered these fictional works, but also in the histories of collection, preservation, and eventually digitization that make that newspaper fiction available for computational analysis, a process she outlines in detail in chapter 3, which details the social and technical structures of the Trove collections from which she draws her newspaper corpus. Importantly, Bode also notes the comprehensiveness of Trove&rsquo;s collections in contrast to similar digital newspaper archives in the US, such as Chronicling America, which lends even more force to the book&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p>Part II of  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  transitions from laying theoretical groundwork to applying its theories to specific case studies, analyzing what the book&rsquo;s scholarly edition of a literary system indicates about authorship, anonymity, and reception of fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers (chapter 4); what network analysis might show about circulation and the influence of syndication networks (chapter 5); and how topic models might reveal shifting regional and national literary traditions over the study&rsquo;s time period (chapter 6). At this point, I must confess one limitation in my own perspective. While I work extensively with digitized historical newspapers, my focus is on American (and more recently transatlantic) newspaper literature. Thus I feel most qualified to comment on Bode&rsquo;s methodological interventions in  <em>A World of Fiction</em> . I am not expert in nineteenth-century Australian literary history, and so must take Bode&rsquo;s claims of intervention in this domain as read, assuming her characterization of the existing scholarship is made in good faith and that her findings challenge them in the ways she outlines. I will refer to these claims primarily as examples of how  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  moves between data and literary history, a move this book makes with particular alacrity. In reading, I learned a good deal about how nineteenth-century Australian newspaper fiction differed from American newspaper fiction, and in fact one additional merit of  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  is that it brings into focus a literary domain that is largely neglected in American literary study. Nevertheless, I must acknowledge that an expert in Australian literature might review some of Bode&rsquo;s claims differently.</p>
<p>In chapter 4, Bode works with the metadata she has assembled about the authors of Australian newspaper fiction to explore their demographics and reception in metropolitan and provincial newspapers. In some cases,  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  confirms previous scholarship, finding for example a trend away from anonymous authorship as the nineteenth-century progressed, though this trend is less definitive than prior narratives have claimed. From here, however,  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  advances a number of novel interpretations of authorship in the period. First, Bode finds that named authorship is far less important than attributed nationality. She writes,  “47 percent of titles were inscribed with an authorial gender and 79 percent with a nationality. This relatively low rate of gender inscription…emphasizes the point already made: that the author was not the primary framework through which colonial readers interpreted fiction”   <sup id="fnref6:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Digging into gender further, Bode finds that, in contrast to much scholarship on nineteenth-century periodical literature, colonial Australian literature was more often written by men than women, and more likely to be local than is typically understood. Tracing trends across the century, Bode finds that prestige shifts over time: in urban newspapers, at least, local writing is valued more earlier in the century, when it is ascribed mostly to men, and loses prestige later in the century, when more women are contributing fiction to Australian newspapers. These are only a few of the trends Bode traces in this chapter, which demonstrates clearly how the data she collects and annotates can be used to elucidate the complex social and demographic situation of newspaper fiction in the period.</p>
<h2 id="revelatory-networks">Revelatory Networks</h2>
<p>In  <em>A World of Fiction</em> &rsquo;s next chapter, Bode explores the effects of syndication networks on the distribution and circulation of fiction in nineteenth-century Australian newspapers. She begins, however, with a strong caution of network analysis as it is typically implemented in data-rich literary history. In particular, Bode warns that  “The probability measures needed to model systems based on highly incomplete datasets are at odds with the centrality of documentary evidence to historical argumentation.”  While I am not entirely convinced by the definitive claim that  “Literary historians focus on what occurred and why, not what might have taken place based on assumptions and probabilities”   <sup id="fnref7:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, Bode&rsquo;s overall skepticism about network graphs constructed from mostly incomplete and partial datasets is well taken, as is her critique of analysis focused on network visualizations rather than their underlying metrics. In the ensuing chapter, Bode uses network analysis primarily to explore her data rather than to make quantitative claims about it, and she does not employ network visualizations at all, instead charting the proportions of serialized and reprinted fiction across a number of categories: e.g. Australian vs. British, or metropolitan vs. provincial. Her findings demonstrate the importance of provincial networks to the publication and circulation of Australian fiction in the period, acting as a counterforce to dominant metropolitan syndicates that imported British and American fiction into the colony.</p>
<p>In its final content chapter,  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  uses a combination of topic modeling and decision trees in order to determine  “whether, and if so what, characteristics distinguished the American, Australian, and British fiction in colonial newspapers.”  As in her exploration of gender in chapter 4, here Bode finds that topics hew more closely to author&rsquo;s national identity than to their gender. The Australian literary voice is characterized most strongly by topics drawn  “from prominent descriptions of nonmetropolitan colonial settings, characters, and activities,”  but also by more  “prominently depicting Aboriginal characters”  than previous scholarship has acknowledged <sup id="fnref8:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This latter claim requires exposition, and while Bode finds a much greater presence of Aboriginal characters than expected based on previous theorizations of colonial literature, she outlines how these depictions rely on negative stereotypes, such that the presence of Aboriginal people actually serves to justify the colonial project in most of these works. Bode notes that  “In identity politics and literary criticism…oppression and emancipation are equated with nonrepresentation and representation, respectively”  while she finds the opposite in the Australian newspaper fiction of the nineteenth century, which  “asserted colonial ownership by prominently and consistently depicting [Aboriginal characters], sometimes in highly unsettling ways”   <sup id="fnref9:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Throughout this chapter, Bode moves deftly between the statistical relationships between words in her study&rsquo;s topic model, to the probabilities these topics would be associated with particular categories of author, to literary-historical interpretation that sometimes confirms, but often nuances or challenges existing scholarship.</p>
<p>In her conclusion, Bode overviews the interventions of  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  while opening up her discussion in a few pressing directions. First, she turns to the many questions the book did not answer, whether due to time or disciplinary expertise, and invites other scholars to engage with her scholarly edition of a literary system — in other words, with the curated and annotated datasets available as both downloads and in the interface linked to above — to engage those questions or formulate their own. Bode writes that the  “scale of fiction encompassed by this scholarly edition and its international breadth make me confident that almost any historian of nineteenth-century literature will find something to extend their knowledge and enrich their research in this representation of a literary system”   <sup id="fnref10:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, a claim which seems sure to bear out as more scholars engage this work. Bode closes the book in a brief but urgent discussion of funding for resources such as Trove that are invaluable to the next generation of literary historical work but are in constant danger of defunding and loss of public support. Here Bode addresses the final but essential node in the literary system, the one which makes these kinds of analyses possible.</p>
<p>In all,  <em>A World of Fiction</em>  is an important work of scholarship that should be read, at the least, by scholars in digital humanities, nineteenth-century studies, book history, periodical studies, and library science. The book should certainly become a standard reference point in courses on humanities data analysis, cultural analytics, distant reading, and related methods. Bode brings the two poles of digital textual studies together compellingly, demonstrating how computational analyses might bring nuance and complexity to our readings of digitized archives of historical texts, and how the contours of those archives — the circumstances of their collection, selection, and digitization practices — might shape the framing of data-rich analyses. Her computational work is founded on and helps build a critical edition; the two activities are mutually imbricated rather than unfolding as distinct projects. Rather than restricting the work, Bode&rsquo;s firm disciplinary perspective ensures that the book&rsquo;s claims will resonate with area scholars: that the interpretive consequences of her computational work are clear. Bode&rsquo;s book productively challenges the dominant paradigms of  “distant reading,”  offering a more nuanced path forward for practitioners while inviting a much wider range of scholars to the data discussion.</p>

<p>Much effort is spent to preserve cultural artifacts through digitization including artworks, written documents and sites of cultural heritage: the  <em>Time Machine Project</em> 1, a collaborative effort between science and humanities researchers and institutions worldwide, uses digital data and innovative computer technologies to build an image of European history covering more than a thousand-year period. Through large-scale digitization of cultural artifacts the project aims to preserve and revive the past of cities such as Venice, Amsterdam, Paris, Budapest or Jerusalem. The  <em>Time Machine</em>  is exemplary for current research projects within the digital humanities which digitize text documents and images (i.e., artworks), thus creating large data repositories, and use innovative methods for analysis. These repositories are equivalent to large storage boxes of information, which bear witness to the past, visual preferences or relationships between artists and herald new knowledge. In order to transform information inherent in digital images into new knowledge, we require computational methods, which are able to process and access thousands of images and consider the specific characteristics of digital data such as being reproducible and modifiable. By using computer algorithms and technologies to view and analyze digital images, scholars can establish new connections between images or gain new insights regarding the reach of a specific motif or style or the frequency of artistic exchange. In addition image details become visible through, for example, X-rays, gamma rays or other physicochemical processes.</p>
<p>The availability of image collections and computational methods impacts society and scientific research, because they enable new ways of communication, the creation of a global (scholarly) network and a simplified access to images for experts and non-experts, because current systems to access collections operate on visual inputs — examples are presented in section four. So far scholars use digital images to reinforce arguments in publications or presentations, to view image details or place geographically distant artworks next to each other for comparison. While art historians already work with digital images, methods to view and present them have remained similar to traditional approaches: PowerPoint presentations mostly show comparisons of image pairs, online databases are structured according to established data models, for example a hierarchical tree structure, and links between images are influenced by the expertise of the art historian, who prepares the presentation: a specialist in seventeen-century Dutch painting most likely identifies similarities and differences in form and content between the works of Jan Vermeer (1632-75), Frans Hals (c1582-1666) or Rembrandt (1606-1669). The same person would probably find it more challenging to enlarge this cohesive group and define links between seventeen-century Dutch artists and other European artists of the same period or even modern painters. Moreover links are not only influenced by the expertise of the scholar, but also by the availability of information and facts validated and promoted by the art historical canon. However, this approach to link images is not representative of the possibilities offered by digital data. This essay argues that we need genuine computational methods to evaluate digital data, because traditional analog methods do not make use of the specific characteristics and possibilities of digital data. To create computational methods, which utilize the specific characteristics, requires transformative processes, namely from analog to digital data and digital to computational methods. We speak of traditional methods to refer to approaches in art history, which have been suggested for the study of artworks, such as Heinrich Wölfflin’s (1864-1945)  <em>Formalism</em>  or Erwin Panofsky’s (1892-1968) iconographical-iconological method. While the former amplifies formal properties of an artwork to identify an epoch or culture and mainly disregards content, Panofsky’s method studies form and content. He established three stages: (1) A description of form, (2) decoding of attributes and symbols and (3) the study of the historical context in which the artwork was created [Hatt/Klonk 2006]. German art historian Aby Warburg (1866-1929) developed his  <em>Mnemosyne Atlas</em>  as a method to illustrate visual continuities from antiquity to the Renaissance in paintings, drawings, sculptures and other artifacts. To visualize these visual trails he utilized wooden boards covered in black cloth on which he pinned his reproductions <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Although Warburg left the project unfinished with his death in 1929, the  <em>Atlas</em>  was continued and further studied by his colleagues Gertrud Bing (1892-1964) and Fritz Saxl (1890-1948) <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and presently by the Warburg Institute and Cornell University Library, which recreated ten panels from the  <em>Atlas</em>  online offering additional information and suggested readings <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Although these traditional methods vary in their focus and were developed for different purposes, they still have some commonalities: methods have been applied over a long period of time and are still used today; they were defined by humanists or art historians; operate on smaller image collections and results are based on visual observations and knowledge of art historians. In comparison computational methods are relatively new; their efficiency and the validity of results are still being evaluated and thus must be viewed critically. Computational methods are mostly developed by computer scientists to solve tasks such as classification and recognition using large collections of real images. Only in recent years have these approaches been developed in collaboration with art historians and applied to art data. In contrast to traditional approaches, computational methods operate on a visual level and do not consider external knowledge about historical conditions for analysis. Therefore differences between traditional and computational methods mostly refer to the developer, purpose, number of images, longevity and inclusion of external information. The shortcomings of traditional methods relate to these differences and include the relatively small image collection, which is analyzed, and the fact that results are often influenced by the knowledge of the art historian.</p>
<p>Our argumentation is supported by personal experience and recent research projects, which demonstrate the potential of computer methods for art historical research. These computer methods assist for example with restoration work or virtual reconstructions of missing artifacts. On July 8, 2019, a research team from the  <em>Rijksmuseum</em>  in Amsterdam together with collaborators from museums and universities in the Netherlands and worldwide embarked on a large-scale research and restoration project: using digital imaging techniques and other advanced methods from computer science and artificial intelligence, researchers investigate the original appearance and current state of Rembrandt’s  <em>Night Watch</em>  (1642) to acquire new information about the painting. The  <em>Operation Night Watch</em>  studies questions relating to the original commission or Rembrandt’s preferred materials and painting techniques to understand changes in appearance and determine a treatment plan for restoration. Ultimately the project aims to preserve Rembrandt’s masterpiece in digital form. The current status of the research project can be followed live on the museum’s website <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. In 2016 a team consisting of collaborators from ING, Microsoft and scholars from TU Delft, The Mauritshuis and the Rembrandt House Museum unveiled a new painting by Rembrandt. The project entitled  <em>The Next Rembrandt</em>  analyzed a large collection of paintings by Rembrandt to create a next Rembrandt utilizing high-resolution 3D scans of paintings, deep learning algorithms to process and chart images and a 3D printer. By analyzing the data, scholars were able to study the preferred subject of Rembrandt, his use of color, light and shadow in images <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Other research examples use digital data and computer vision algorithms to estimate the source of illumination in paintings to reason about painting practice in the Renaissance and Baroque <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> or virtual reality techniques to reconstruct a segment of the Berlin Wall and surrounding neighborhoods. The project  <em>Virtuelle Mauer/ReConstructing the Wall</em>  led by Tamiko Thiel and Teresa Reuter creates a virtual installation, which aims to understand how the Wall and the possibility of escape impacted everyday life for residents <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Many more examples at the intersection of art and technology are provided on Google’s  <em>Arts and Culture Experiments</em>  website. The website presents projects from various artists, computer scientists and other researchers, which unlock culture on the basis of large datasets: the project  “From a picture to a thousand stories”  links art and books based on a single image; in  “Draw to Art”  a doodle is used as a query to discover related works of art <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. All listed research projects demonstrate the great potential of computer technologies and how these are deployed to support art historical research and consequently produce new knowledge for the field — unattainable by traditional methods or analog data. Lastly authors have expertise in computer vision and art history; together they created and applied computational methods to art data. Authors were thus able to identify shortcomings of traditional approaches and create solutions: projects included the development of a search engine for object detection, which was applied to for example a dataset of exhibition photographs to study changing exhibition contexts <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, or the study of artistic style through a computational style transfer <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows: after presenting related works, which include (theoretical) discussions within the digital humanities about current digital practices and research done in computer vision on the topics of classification, object detection, finding visual similarities or image generation, the article describes the transformation of analog to digital data and digital to computational methods. It then elaborates on the specific characteristics of digital data, including its modification and reproduction, the latter of which propels a wider distribution of images. The main part of the article discusses the insufficiency of simply turning analog into digital methods and provides examples of genuine computational methods, which support this argument and were created and used to analyze art data. Examples focus on object detection to access large image collections, data visualization to establish links between images and image generation and manipulation. Based on this we reach the following conclusions: first we require digital data and computational methods to produce new knowledge. It is not sufficient to simply translate existing analog into digital methods, because they do not consider and make use of the specific properties of digital data, such as being reproducible, modifiable, or able to capture granular image properties.Traditional approaches are unable to display thousands of images in one space or offer multiple ways to access image collections, which are necessary to cater for scholars’ individual research questions. In order to fully exploit the potential of digital data and produce new knowledge, we need genuine computational methods based on neural networks. Examples given in the text show that these methods enable an automatic data analysis, facilitate a data exploration, or generate entirely new perspectives of the art object. Visualization techniques for example group portraits according to social status and age of the depicted person given only visual user input. In addition interfaces for object retrieval enable to search for objects such as the ’medal’ in a large collection of images (see Figure 5). Both examples highlight that computer technologies and results facilitate a large-scale and fine-grained analysis of data collections to create overarching links or study changes in form, content or image context. Other examples will show that generative models produce new perspectives of the art object or give insights into artistic style and defining style properties. We demonstrate that by changing visual properties such as shape and appearance or transferring the Impressionist style of Claude Monet (1840-1926) or the Post-Impressionist style of Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) onto real photos using computer models, we are able to study the effect of style on content or how the atmosphere of the image changes for different styles. Second, based on given examples and personal experience, we conclude that it is difficult to make precise predictions about the future of digital art history but that in order to create computer methods, which are helpful for art historical research and exceed the capabilities of analog methods, we must reduce skepticism towards new technologies and emphasize the value of the work of the respective other discipline. To achieve this, scholars from computer vision and art history must work together and computational tools must be made more accessible.</p>
<h2 id="related-works">Related Works</h2>
<p>Digital humanities and in particular digital art history is a vibrant and dynamic research field. In recent years there has been a significant increase of theoretical and research-related works, which discuss and illustrate how digital data and methods impact art history. Scholars elaborate on current digital and computational practices <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, point to insufficiencies of existing approaches and research gaps <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> and, for example, refer to the often loose and unspecific usage of terms such as beautyand inconsiderate nature of many works. In her article  “Against Digital Art History”  Bishop gives the example of a facial-recognition software which had to establish, given 120,000 portraits from the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries, whether the concept of beauty had changed over time. Unsurprisingly to everyone who is at least a little bit familiar with modernism, the software determined a decrease of ’beauty’ in the twentieth century. Authors of this work missed however to discuss the reason of this decrease, the subjectivity of ’beauty’ or how the selected dataset influenced the result <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Some comment on the fact that computer-based projects provide a quantitative analysis but miss a zoomed-in study <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. In order to assist research and produce knowledge, which is reflective of new possibilities, scholars need tools for a quantitative and qualitative analysis <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Johanna Drucker’s article  “Is There a  Digital  Art History?”  is a reflective comment on digital art history and provides valuable reference points for this essay <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. She elaborates that cultural theories of the 1980s impacted art history, because they questioned the properties of an object, i.e., its function, social role or intention and thus our understanding of it; she demands the same effect for digital methods. Famously she makes the distinction between a digitized and digital art history. The former refers to the simple use of digital image collections, the latter includes the use of computational methods for data mining, network analysis or textual study <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. The following section gives an overview of main tasks for which computer vision developed computational methods, these include the classification of artworks, recognition of objects, finding visual similarities between images and image generation. Current approaches to solve these tasks are based on neural networks, which are modeled according to the human brain and consist of multiple layers. In contrast to older approaches, networks are able to process thousands of images in an unsupervised manner, meaning that they require no human intervention. At every layer the network extracts features from images, which provide essential information to solve the given task. In lower layers features refer to color, shape or textures; higher layers include more complex information about content and relations between semantic concepts such as eyes or mouth <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Individual sections not only include research examples from computer vision but also digital art history. In recent years the field has adopted these methods and applied them to art datasets, performing tasks generally done by art historians (i.e., classification or finding visual similarities). Eventually given examples highlight the potential and success of a comprehensive, computational image analysis.</p>
<p>Classification Computer vision research has suggested numerous approaches, which address the task of an automatic image classification of thousands of images using neural networks <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Most approaches utilize a subset of ImageNet, a database consisting of over fourteen million images from more than 20,000 categories including plants or animals. Since 2010 the community takes part in the annual ImageNet LargeScale Visual Recognition Challenge which evaluates the efficiency of algorithms for the tasks of object localization/detection, scene classification and parsing, given a number of images from specific categories <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Depending on the task the winner is the team which achieves the minimum average error or highest accuracy over all test images <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. In 2016 the winner for the task of object detection achieved an impressive mean accuracy of 66.27 percent on most object categories <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Following works presented solutions to improve the classification accuracy through for example an attention mechanism <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. The neural network perceives information about visual properties (i.e., color) or pixel arrangements, which suggest the presence of an object. The localization of the object a priori simplifies the classification task <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. These methods demonstrate the ability of networks to perceive content and their high efficiency to organize data accordingly. Approaches were then applied to the classification of art data. Karayev et al. classified 80,000 Flickr photographs and 100,000 images — mostly paintings — from the WikiArt collection according to styles using a convolutional neural network — a certain class of neural networks, which includes the mathematical operation of convolution. For the latter 25 style labels such as Symbolism, Expressionism or Art Nouveau were used <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Others focused on predicting style, genre and artist based on features extracted by neural networks and provided similarity measures between images <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Based on a style classification of 77,000 paintings and a visualization of images, Elgammal et al. correlated the visible groupings with Heinrich Wölfflin’s five contrasting principles of art history <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>: linear versus painterly, plane versus recession, closed versus open, multiplicity versus unity and absolute versus relative clarity <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Object detection The fast and precise localization and recognition of objects in images has been a prevalent computer vision task <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Redmon et al. for example presented a neural network which is capable to localize objects in images and to provide class labels such as human, dog, horse and probabilities in one go <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Current research papers have exploited information about relations between objects to improve the accuracy and speed of detection. Relations are based for example on the object’s appearance or geometry <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. Detection approaches have been transferred to art data, aiming to find objects such as horses or ships in paintings. Research works have studied the domain shift problem, evaluating the performance of classifiers trained on real images (mainly from ImageNet) versus paintings <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. The task of finding identical and similar objects, which display little shape variances in a dataset of medieval manuscripts, was studied by <a href="#takami2014">Takami et al. (2014)</a>. Moreover Schlecht et al. utilized a template-based detector to find gestures in manuscripts. The authors first collected a small set of labeled instances of a gesture type and then found additional examples showing shape variations using computer algorithms <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. Others added curvature information of objects to improve detections <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. A discriminative model based on parts and randomly aggregated compositions was further employed to assist with object detection and scene classification <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. While these research projects demonstrate the abilities of a computer-based detection, they also show that networks are often challenged by unknown, often pre-modern object categories or objects defamiliarized by style properties. This is mainly because detection networks were trained on real photos and therefore have never seen instances of swords, medieval clothing or objects deformed by Cubism <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Visual similarity Aspects such as relationships between a master and a student, the stay of artists at foreign courts, the circulation of books or exhibitions manifest in artworks through similar colors, brushstrokes, objects or compositions. The identification of these similarities is a central task of art historians. The computer vision community has presented numerous approaches to find visual similarities between images <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Bautista et al. grouped images in cliques of similar samples around an initial exemplar and utilized information about highly similar and distant samples for the task of finding visually similar images <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. Kim et al. proposed a neural network to establish correspondences between semantically similar images, which is invariant to varying attributes such as color or texture <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. Other methods leverage information about geometry and context to improve semantic matching <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. Qualitative results and quantitative evaluations in respective papers show the impressive abilities of networks to retrieve similar images from large datasets. To assist art historical research, these methods have been applied to art data. Seguin et al. established links using neural networks, pre-trained on human-annotated clusters of similar paintings <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. An additional approach was suggested by Shen et al. to link visual patterns in artworks of the Brueghel family and in photos of buildings and landmarks. The method relies on randomly sampled regions from images which are compared to all images in the dataset to find similar regions. A correspondence between regions is valid if surrounding regions can be matched as well <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Saleh et al. calculated the similarity between paintings regarding content or style using Euclidean distances to determine artistic influences <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Generative models In machine learning the advent ofGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs), first introduced by <a href="#goodfellow2014">Goodfellow et al. in 2014</a>, triggered a new interest in generative models 2 to alter shape or appearance of objects or to translate an image into a new domain: a painting by Monet turns into a real photograph, a zebra into a horse or a winter into a summer landscape. Goodfellow presented a framework to estimate generative models based on an adversarial, competitive process of two models: a generative model, which approximates the data distribution of the training set, and a discriminative model; the latter estimates the probability of a data sample belonging to a training set or generator G <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. Generative models 2 have been used for the task of image generation and transfer, for example for appearance and shape generation <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. The model proposed by Esser et al. allows to  “synthesize different geometrical layouts or change the appearance of an object, either shape or appearance can be retained from a query image, whereas the other component can be freely altered or even imputed from other images”   <sup id="fnref1:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Lorenz et al. utilized generative models to disentangle shape and appearance of an object, which is necessary because of large intra-class variations such as pose, texture, color or clothing. The authors evaluate their approach on the tasks of pose prediction and image synthesis and provide remarkable and authentically looking results for image generation. Results demonstrate how the model can estimate shape or how appearances can be exchanged for parts <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. Generative models are also used for the task of style transfer, which describes the stylization of a real photo in the style of an artist, such as Claude Monet (1840-1926), Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) or Picasso (1881-1973). The task is either based on one input image <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> or a collection of paintings <sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, aiming to fully capture an artist’s style. Subsequent works focused on improving the stylization process and image results by separating style and content <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>, gaining control over the degree of stylization for different image regions <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>, or speeding up the stylization process <sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Other approaches pay attention to transform content in a style-specific manner <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> or capture variations and particularities of a style <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. Stylized images show that generative models are not only able to perceive what is depicted on images but also how. Models were able to learn the particularities of style and produce — if not authentic paintings by Monet or Picasso – at least compellingly looking images.</p>
<p>Provided examples for the tasks of classification, object detection, finding visual similarities or image generation indicate the great potential of computational approaches for art analysis as they are able to process thousands of images, thus increasing the scope of an evaluation, assist with art historical tasks, alter the art object or create new perspectives via style transfer. Notably in comparison to an automatic image classification or object and similarity detection, generative models are genuinely computational and do not have an analog counterpart.</p>
<p>Others Other works utilized computer-based methods to address additionalconcerns relevant to art history.  “How can we explore patterns and relations between sets of photographs, designs, or video, which may number in hundreds of thousands, millions, or billions?”   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> — this question was answered by media theorist and digital humanist Lev Manovich and his lab, who develop new methods to analyze and visualize large data collections according to individual visual characteristics of images. These methods consist of two steps: First visual properties of images such as color, contrast or saturation are translated into numbers through image processing. These values are then taken to position all images in a two dimensional visualization. Manovich and lab used this method for example to visualize more than one million manga pages according to different image characteristics <sup id="fnref1:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. Li et al. automatically extracted brushstrokes in paintings by van Gogh for authentication and dating purposes. Therefore the authors had to define his signature brushstroke: an algorithm was utilized to identify edges which indicate a brushstroke. Additional algorithms were facilitated to automatically fill in gaps if a brushstroke was not fully enclosed <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. A fully enclosed brushstroke was extracted  “by setting the edge pixels as background and the non-edge pixels as foreground”   <sup id="fnref1:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. A brushstroke was considered valid if it fulfilled certain conditions: for example the skeleton was not severely branched or the ratio of broadness to length lied within a prior defined range. Brushstrokes were analyzed to determine their average length, width or orientation <sup id="fnref2:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. Algorithms were also utilized to segment individual strokes in drawings by mostly Picasso, Henry Matisse and German artist Egon Schiele in order to assist with their attribution or to determine between original and fake. The approach is based on the quantification and comparison of stroke characteristics, such as shape, tone variations and local shape characteristics, using a stroke segmentation algorithm. This algorithm first extracted a stroke network and subseq.uently untangled the network to get individual strokes <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="3-transformative-processes-from-analog-to-digital-and-digital-to-computational">3. Transformative processes: from analog to digital and digital to computational</h2>
<p>Digitization describes the transformation of analog data into digital data through for example scanners or digital cameras: sensors implemented in devices convert a two-dimensional image into a numerical representation. Optical character recognition (OCR) is specifically used to translate a handwritten or typed document into a digital text document (see Figure 1). These techniques have produced large data repositories containing text, image, video or music files. Images include reproductions of artworks and other cultural artifacts which are gathered and published on museum websites and in online databases such as WikiArt and shared on social media platforms. The online availability of images has various consequences: images reach a wider audience, allow for an easy comparison of spatially distant artworks (because they belong to different collections or museums) and propel the development and use of methods which are able to process and analyze them thus shifting the focus from images to image processing techniques. In  “Is There a  Digital  Art History?”  Drucker discusses this shift and explicitly distinguishes between a digitized and digital art history. Digitized refers to the building of digital image repositories and its subsequent use in research, while the latter describes the usage of computer-based methods for art analysis. Drucker lists the following methods as central to the digital humanities:  “text  mark up,  topic modeling, structured metadata, visualization of information, network analysis, discourse analysis, virtual modeling, simulation and aggregation of materials distributed across geographical locations”   <sup id="fnref2:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. These methods still resemble traditional methods, because they for example rely on a model which structures the data, use pre-defined terminology to describe digital data or require manual annotations. Therefore these methods restrict the possibilities of digital data and essentially hinder the production of new knowledge. The current status of digital humanities and the fast progress in computer vision, especially in deep learning 3, require an extension of the process defined by Drucker. We argue that in order to exploit the potential of digital data and produce knowledge, an additional process must take place, namely from a digital to a computational art history. The latter demands the processing of digital data using automatic and unsupervised computational methods. These methods require minimum or no human intervention and do not resemble existing, analog methods.</p>
<h2 id="31-what-are-the-specifics-of-digital-data">3.1 What are the specifics of digital data?</h2>
<p>“We have to take into account the ways digital humanities more broadly have taken up computational techniques and then consider the specificity of visual art objects and their particular requirements and points of resistance”   <sup id="fnref3:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Drucker remarks on a process very common in the digital humanities: methods are developed first or existing approaches are simply taken and specificities and requirements of digital data are considered afterwards. However, this approach as stated does not consider characteristics of digital data during the phase of development and therefore restricts the potential of digital data and methods. Although we have transferred analog image processing into a digital space, we restrict ourselves to knowledge which could have been obtained with analog data and methods. Instead, we must identify special characteristics and requirements of digital data first and create corresponding methods afterwards. Examples of research projects in the last section of this article highlight the importance and validity of this thought process. But what are the specifics of digital data in comparison to analog data which should be considered and explicitly exploited by new methods?</p>
<p>Digitization through, for example scanning, describes the translation of an analog, continuous into a digital, discrete signal. Digital images are thus available as numeric representations. This means that certain aspects in images such as composition, spatial relations between objects and figures or color can be evaluated statistically and expressed in descriptive statistics. Through a statistical analysis we are able to summarize the content of one or multiple images in representative statistics. These provide factual and objective descriptions of digital artworks, which are impossible to create for analog images and with analog methods. By looking at these image statistics, art historians are able to study the popularity of a composition, the degree to which artists relied on compositional models or when a color originated and how frequent it was adapted by artists.</p>
<p>In addition digital images can be easily duplicated because they are stored as numerical representations. These digital copies are reproductions of existing artworks and not computer-generated images. In contrast to the analog image, the digital reproduction is transportable and easy to distribute. Digital image copies can be shared with colleagues or used for multiple projects, thus supporting collaborations and the founding of a global network of scholars. Digitization then supports the transformation of art history from a locally and nationally determined discipline, where each country favors different methods and topics, to an international and dynamic field. While the reproduction of images offers great potential for society and research, it also holds disadvantages: reproduction quality varies for images; color, illumination, sharpness or contrast are often misrepresented in digital images and falsify the appearance of the original artwork. These visual alterations must be considered in an interpretation or when developing computational methods. An erroneous color reproduction might establish a visual similarity of actually dissimilar images and a blurry image conceals details otherwise visible. Duplications of artworks also raise questions of originality, uniqueness and authenticity. German philosopher and art critic Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) famously addresses these issues in his essay  “The Artwork in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”  first published in German in 1935:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in physical condition over the years as well as the various changes in its ownership. The traces of the first can be revealed only by chemical or physical analyzes which it is impossible to perform on a reproduction&hellip;<br>
<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore the digital artwork challenges the uniqueness of the original artwork and detaches it from any place or time restriction. According to Benjamin, the originality of an artwork and its existence at a particular time and place is the prerequisite of authenticity <sup id="fnref1:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>; for the viewer and in particular the scholar this attachment has consequences. The function and role as well as the physical effect of the artwork can never be fully comprehended through digital images. Instead, we are only able to guess and hypothesize, thus providing a first insight but never a full picture of the artwork in its original context. To do so we have to see it in person, if possible, in its actual environment: the museum. While the removal of authenticity, uniqueness and original context are shortcomings of digitization, it allows to preserve art and cultural heritage in digital form. This is especially relevant for works which are exposed to weather conditions or pollution or which are made out of fragile material, examples include weavings, fresco paintings or stained glass windows. Street art is a current art form which faces — but also consciously plays with — these threats. As Benjamin mentions in his essay, reproduction techniques further blur physical damages such as cracks on the original artwork <sup id="fnref2:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. The damaged artwork is thus restored in digital form. For art historians this aspect is ambiguous: on the one hand, it enables to study the unharmed artwork and to reason about its original appearance, on the other hand it gives a false impression of the artwork’s current condition.</p>
<p>The representation of digital data as values makes it modifiable and editable through computer technologies. While this article focuses on the potentials of image editing and manipulation for art historical research, we feel propelled to express caution. The image observer must always be aware of the possibility of image manipulation and must challenge and critically evaluate the image content. We advocate for a transparent manipulation of digital art images, because the benefits for art historical research are too significant as following examples show. Editing programs such as AdobePhotoshop enable art historians to perform simple operations: they can crop details from images, alter the format and resize the image or change color or saturation. These alterations already offer new insights: a change of color emphasizes its importance for an artwork and illustrates how its perception and general meaning changes through the modification of color. By altering formal properties of images we produce different versions of the artwork and present new perspectives. Section four includes research examples which also produce unknown views of the object or artwork, however exceeding these early operations by far; computational methods not only change color, but alter textures, brushstrokes, content or the shape of objects.</p>
<p>Through editing programs scholars might also enlarge images to study brushstroke and texture of artworks or details, which would be overlooked or remain unnoticed otherwise. By enlarging image regions, art historians are able to study Jan van Eyck’s  <em>Arnolfini Portrait</em>  (1434) in detail. The mirror depicted in the background was particularly interesting for art historians. Essays discussed the identity of the persons shown in the reflection or the frame depicting the ten stations from the Passion of Christ. The observer is further propelled to appreciate the haptic quality of the dog’s fur, the material of the chandelier, the flowers seen through the window or the decorative details of the wooden bed <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. All details give proof of the mastery of van Eyck and can only be studied through the availability of the digital image by most scholars as they do not have access to the respective museum or are not allowed to see the physical painting up close (see Figure 2).</p>

<p>In contrast to digital images, analog images are restricted, often attached to a specific space and thus can only be enjoyed by a selected group of people who have access to specific spaces, museums or can afford entrance fees. The access to digital images is offered to much more people and simplified by computers and the internet. Seemingly audiences can immerse themselves in art and culture through digital images regardless of geographic location, nationality or social status. A study of the World Bank conducted in 2016 however has shown that while technologies have connected people on large scale, sixty percent of the world’s population still have no access to the internet. This means that there is a growing digital divide between the rich and poor and rural and suburban regions and that advantages of digital technologies are mostly beneficial for the wealthy and educated <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. Thus large parts of the population are still not able to enjoy art through digital images. Other factors further limit the access to images, this includes fees to image collections, copyright or political regulations. While art has become more inclusive through the wider and simplified access to digital art images, limitations and exclusions of specific demographics are still present.</p>
<p>Essentially the numerical representation of digital images facilitates their duplication, modification, availability or accessibility — all these are the specific characteristics of digital data. Aforementioned operations such as the changing of color, saturation or cropping of details are possible because of these characteristics, but only present a small fraction of current possibilities. The availability of digital images and their (numerical) representation also support the employment of computational methods for art analysis and their subsequent processing through neural networks. Computational methods by far exceed previous operations and capabilities and are able to produce even more knowledge. The specific characteristics of digital data and the presence of automatic methods in computer vision highlight that it is not enough to simply simulate analog methods in order to produce new knowledge for the field of art history but that computer scientists in collaboration with art historians must create new approaches.</p>
<h2 id="32-why-it-is-not-enough-to-simply-translate-analog-into-computational-methods">3.2 Why it is not enough to simply translate analog into computational methods</h2>
<p>The previous section has emphasized that analog and digital data are characterized by different qualities, the latter for example is reproducible and modifiable. These differences suggest that although both formats still carry the same information, methods to extract information and produce new knowledge must differ. Analog images are often visualized in pairs; artworks are placed next to each other on a table or pinned on a board to compare visual properties. Heinrich Wölfflin’s method to study artworks was essentially comparative: pairs of images, which embodied different sets of visual principles (linear versus painterly, plane versus recession, closed versus open, multiplicity versus unity, absolute versus relative clarity), were used to emphasize stylistic and historical shifts between the Renaissance and Baroque period <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Aby Warburg extended this comparative approach with the  <em>Mnemosyne Atlas</em> ; his wooden panels provided space to visualize multiple images. An analog visualization might be further enlarged, but at one point the physicality of analog images demands too much space and the visualization is hardly comprehensible and understandable to the observer anymore. If we adapt this visualization method for digital data, it means that images are viewed — although on a computer screen — in pairs or a limited number. However, the presentation in pairs neglects the fact that a digital space offers to display significantly more images: thousands of images might be viewed and compared simultaneously; the user can change perspectives, zoom in or obtain an overview of the data. Visualizations of digital data are much more interactive and adaptable to needs and requirements of scholars. The  <em>t-SNE Map</em>  project, created by Cyril Diagne, Nicolas Barradeau and Simon Doury for Google’s Arts and Culture Experiments, uses machine learning algorithms to map thousands of artworks in an interactive 3D landscape according to visual similarities <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. The project enables a virtual tour through the digital collections currently included in the Google Arts and Cultureonline website. The platform currently hosts collections from 1,200 museums and cultural institutions worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art (New York), Uffizi Gallery (Florence), The Art Institute Chicago or the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>. Although the  <em>t-SNE Map</em>  project focuses on data visualization and exploration and neglects a thorough data analysis, it enhances the possibility of computer technologies to access large image collections and study artworks from various angles and at different scales. If we continue to use techniques which resemble analog approaches to visualize digital images, we do not embrace the fact that computer-based visualization techniques significantly enhance our viewing practices.</p>
<p>The digital presence and reproducibility of digital data also enables its localization in many data networks or the combination of multiple networks.  “The point is that we could situate a work within the many networks from which it gains meaning and value”   <sup id="fnref4:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. This affects the analysis of single images, since its function and role within many networks can be studied, revealing its ambiguous meaning and adaptiveness to new social or political contexts.</p>
<p>In the past analog data such as prints, photos or books were often stored in rigid systems, organized according to categories, such as genre, technique or topic, or specific data models thus limiting the retrieval of records, exchange of data between different systems or users. Data models define the organization and meaning of the respective data collection <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. There are various models which are used to store data in databases and other information systems: popular examples are the network-model, relational model, entity-set model or hierarchical model. The former three were used as a basis for the entity-relationship model (ER-model), introduced in a paper by Peter Pin-Shan Chen in 1976 <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. The ER-model  “incorporates some of the important semantic information about the real world”   <sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> and provides information about entities and their relationships. The model offers different views of the data because it combines the network model, relational model and entity-set model. The network model consists of divided entities and relationships, which are presented in a non-hierarchical structure <sup id="fnref2:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. The relational model is based on relation theory, where the term relation refers to its usage in mathematics:  “Given Sets S1, S2, &hellip;, Sn&hellip;, R is a relation on these n sets if it is a set of n-tuples each of which has its first element from S1, its second element from S2, and so on”   <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. These relations if straightforward are expressed in arrays of columns <sup id="fnref1:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. Lastly the entity set model is concerned with the properties of entities. Every entity belongs to a different entity set such as secretary, engineer or department; to test whether or not an entity belongs to a distinct set, we have to look at the properties attached to an entity set. It is assumed that if an entity is in the set secretary, it shares properties with all other entities in the set secretary as well <sup id="fnref3:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. Although the ER-model superimposes structure onto digital art data, the value of early data models to separate elements, model their relationship and define common attributes among a set of similar elements must be recognized. The hierarchical model organizes data in a tree structure. This means that records are classified from general to more specific categories, which are predefined by scholars. For art history categories include but are not restricted to epoch, style, artist and topics recurrently painted by artists. The selection of a data model depends on the following aspects: the database in which it is integrated, topics and format of the data, its subsequent function, or the discipline which uses the data. Essentially models should simplify the storage, retrieval and exchange of the data. However because listed data models operate on a fixed, rigid structure and databases often facilitate different models, it is difficult to link various databases or share data <sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. Moreover we also limit their points of access: then images are only accessible through predefined categories, which prohibit a free and individual exploration of the data. After digitization techniques had produced large image repositories, scholars had to promptly decide on a way to store the data meaningfully. Consequently scholars simply applied traditional models to databases such as the hierarchical model and classified digital data accordingly. But in order for data to be accessible by scholars from different disciplines asking diverse research questions, databases have to be flexible, dynamic and open-ended. By assigning digital images to these rigid structures, we limit their flexibility and usability for different, personal visual networks. Consequently (digital) artworks should not be organized according to existing data models, which would describe and predefine them according to terms of the past, but according to flexible and adaptive models.</p>
<p>New forms of analysis become possible through the digital format of the data. Methods are manifold, varied, adaptive to individual research questions and often easier to use than analog methods. The latter is due to the fact that a computer-based analysis is often unsupervised, which means that the processing of images requires minimum human intervention and no descriptive image labels (i.e., genre or style). Computational methods are usable by a general audience, because they do not require expert knowledge to establish for example similarities between images; the link is suggested automatically by the computer, which is capable of processing thousands of images in a short amount of time. There are manifold and varied computational methods which combined provide a multilevel view of the data and make complex interpretations. In contrast to analog methods, computer-based approaches offer a statistical evaluation and visual analysis, the latter is performed by computer vision which transforms images into visual representations (and not numbers). Analog methods are not capable of a statistical analysis, because image information is not stored as numbers, which are easy to read for the computer but not for the human observer. For digital images, we might analyze and measure color distributions, saturation or even the image composition to answer questions such as what colors were preferably used in a given time period or how artworks are composed in general. The study of visual properties with computer technologies reveals overarching or unusual visual patterns. All this information is inherent in digital images and obtainable by computational methods.</p>
<p>Eventually, most analog methods were developed by art historians or adapted from other disciplines: in the early days of digital humanities, traditional methods from art history or computer vision were simply adapted and applied to digital art data without considering their specific needs <sup id="fnref2:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Aby Warburg’s  <em>Mnemosyne Atlas</em>  and corresponding panels are models for early approaches: similar to the computer screen, Warburg’s panels displayed numerous images (instead of pairs) and included hyperlinks and a non-linear, dynamic and open-ended structure <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. However Warburg’s space was restricted by the physical dimension of the wooden panels, which measured approximately 150 x 200 cm <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>, and the number of links between images and hyperlinks to external sources were limited to the information and photographic reproductions available to Warburg. While digital approaches resemble Warburg’s  <em>Atlas</em>  and his way of grouping images, computer technologies exceed Warburg’s abilities and encourage a display of complex image structures and numerous possibilities to access image collections. At present art historians and computer scientists consider these new capabilities and jointly develop genuine computational methods for art historical research. Thus we must encourage collaborations between disciplines to ensure that new methods truly assist art historical research and reduce skepticism towards computational methods. An increased interest is not least visible in the considerable number of digital humanities conferences and journals worldwide; the Digital Humanities Conference, which takes place annually and is organized by the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO), receives contributions from scholars working in the humanities and sciences, thereby demonstrating an increasing intersection of both disciplines <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. However reactions of art historians towards computational methods and a collaboration have been ambiguous: while most use digital images for presentations to visualize research hypotheses or show image details, or online databases to gather images and information, comparably few actually engage in a collaboration with computer scientists and use computational methods for their research. While digital humanities as a subject has been increasingly established at universities worldwide, both art historians and computer scientists are still skeptic towards a general collaboration and the usability and validity of methods and results. A survey among art historians and computer scientists conducted in 2014 amplified these observations. It  “&hellip;intended to shed light on field members’ knowledge of the capabilities and applications of computer technology, attitudes and perceptions about the use of it, and reactions to the meaning of this type pf digitization of the humanities”   <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>. The questionnaire was completed by fifty-nine art historians and sixteen computer scientists and allowed two responses, namely approvals and disapprovals. While we are unable to discuss the survey in its entirety, we nevertheless want to highlight some findings. There was an overall consensus regarding the digitization of humanities: the majority of participants from both fields answered positively when asked about possible collaborations. However more than fifty percent of art historians did not view the implementation of AI technologies in humanities as a positive shift; in comparison, the majority of computer scientists did. The survey also brought forth that most art historians were unaware of the current possibilities of computer technologies for a visual analysis and only knew about the most basic applications, including a physical assessment of art or image retrieval based on descriptive labels <sup id="fnref1:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>.  “Why would I entrust my life’s work to a computer just so I could be made irrelevant”   <sup id="fnref2:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>, was one response by an art historian. Although the survey was conducted five years ago and the field of digital humanities has massively enlarged and evolved since then, the fear of being replaceable and a general skepticism is still perceptible. A solution to further reduce skepticism and encourage collaborations might be to be more transparent with each other, so that the other discipline, its intentions and methods do not remain a black box. Another solution could be to already approach students of art history and computer science and inform them about the potentials of a collaboration. So far students in art history are less affected by computational tools as access has not been widely available. Their use of digital methods and images has been limited to simple visualization techniques and online databases from which they obtain images and information, sources include WikiArt, Wikipedia, museum collections or university catalogues. Digital images have been mostly used for presentations and term papers and altered through basic editing programs, which allowed them to change color, saturation or size. In turn students of computer science utilize art data as another source for the classification or detection task or to increase the robustness of algorithms. However we must emphasize that a collaboration promises much more: it produces new methods to visualize data or to perform an automatic data analysis, which  “draws upon multiple forms of visual analysis that together make complex interpretations of a given object or group of objects”   <sup id="fnref3:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>. Consequently methods enable new questions relating to the popularity or the spatial and temporal spread of a motif. In turn computer science develops robust algorithms and produces methods, which are not only capable to perceive what is depicted but also how. Lastly a collaboration enhances and creates new work fields for art historians and computer scientists.</p>
<p>Previous sections emphasized that it is not sufficient to simply translate analog into digital methods, because they are not reflective of characteristics and possibilities offered by digital data. It is only when we develop new computational methods to process digital data that we are capable of producing new knowledge, which is not possible with analog data and respective methods and which in turn affects not only art historians but also earlier generations of scholars, namely students.</p>
<h2 id="33-computational-methods-to-access-link-and-edit-digital-images">3.3. Computational methods to access, link and edit digital images</h2>
<p>Based on research projects such as the  <em>Time Machine</em>  or Google’s Arts and Culture Experiments and previous remarks we argue that computational methods are especially beneficial to access, link and edit digital images. This section discusses these aspects in more detail and concludes that especially operations of accessing and linking are closely related.</p>
<p>“While access and availability of the art historical corpus have been facilitated by the development of online repositories, tools for&hellip; computational processing have been slow to emerge”   <sup id="fnref5:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Only in recent years have scholars spent increasing efforts to create sufficient tools and methods to access digital image collections. However most are still inspired by analog methods. We have already noted that many databases use data models, such as the network-model, relational model, entity-set model or hierarchical model, which structure collections according to predefined concepts but hinder individual access and a free data exploration. In contrast, computational methods independent of traditional database structures, provide access to large data collections on individual terms. Such methods, which allow easy access and a free exploration, have already been hypothesized at the middle of the twentieth century. In 1945 Vannevar Bush (1890-1974), American engineer and head of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War Two, envisioned a  “future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library&hellip; A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his (the user’s) memory”   <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>. At the end of World War Two Bush already demanded what is at the forefront of digital humanities’ research today, namely to build storage spaces for digital data and methods, which retrieve records fast and according to individual demands. Although Bush remained vague about how these devices should look — supposedly because necessary technologies were missing — , his request that repositories should be consulted with exceeding flexibility supports the current urge to be able to access image collections independent of predefined terms. As we will see in section four current computational methods for object detection, often implemented in interfaces, operate on purely visual information. These methods enable a search for objects, compositions or other arbitrary image regions in large data collections and do not require tedious and error-prone annotations to access data. Thus users formulate search queries based on visual input and do not need to provide text queries, which require knowledge about art historical terms. Instead of searching for examples of a still life users can simply mark an arrangement of fruits, cut flowers or vases to find similar instances. Access to repositories is not only granted through interfaces but also through data visualizations. The digital space is capable of displaying thousands of images at the same time, allowing a direct comparison of image content or style — this has been exemplified by the  <em>t-SNE Map</em>  project of Google’s Arts and Culture Experiments <sup id="fnref1:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. Through visualizations art historians can recognize patterns such as groups of artworks sharing a similar motif or formal property and identify gaps, which indicate that certain visual features were not popular at a certain time.</p>
<p>There have been art historians in the past, who explicitly focused on how art collections can be accessed through visualizations to be comprehensible for the viewer. Hamburg-born art historian and cultural scientist Aby Warburg and his  <em>Mnemosyne Atlas</em>  are often referred to as a starting point for current practices in digital art history. Digital Media professor Stefka Hristova compared present methods of data visualization with Warburg’s method to examine  “shifts and continuities that have shaped informational aesthetics [&hellip;] and data-driven narratives”   <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Warburg accessed image repositories by establishing visual lines of continuity, mainly linking Western antiquity with the Renaissance. He coined the term Bilderfahrzeuge to describe the migration of images, objects and other visual features throughout time 4. The term and concept was materialized through the  <em>Mnemosyne Atlas</em> : the scholar pinned reproductions of artworks on wooden panels covered with black cloth to group images along a common theme <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. These images, which consisted of a relatively fixed number of 2000 reproductions, were often regrouped or completely removed emphasizing a great dynamic of the  <em>Atlas</em>   <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. Warburg was interested in two main concepts, namely the expression of human emotion (Pathosformel) and the afterlife of antiquity (Nachleben der Antike) <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Both concepts were traced from antiquity to the Renaissance through their depiction in paintings, drawings, sculptures and objects. He visualized this continuum by merging images and presenting them on one panel. In this way, the  <em>Atlas</em>  not only operated across genres and media but demonstrated an efficient way of information processing. The  <em>Atlas</em>  enabled Warburg to access a substantial part of the repository of art by linking images based on specific properties content. He focused on  “ images of great, symbolic, intellectual, and emotional power  from the art and culture of Western antiquity through the Renaissance, and up through his own day”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Although Warburg was interested in non-Western cultures — in 1923 he gave a talk on images from the Pueblo Indian region — his  <em>Atlas</em>  focused on Western art and specific periods which are indicative of Western art history such as the Renaissance <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. This restriction might be due to the fact that he selected most reproductions from his own library or photographic collection, which both focused on Western art <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>: in 1909 Warburg wrote to his assistant Wilhelm Waetzoldt (1880-1945):  “I have now got a library for cultural sciences (with a focus on Italy) of ca. 9,000 volumes, to which 600 are added every year, several thousand photographs and a few hundred slides. The aim: a new methodology of cultural science based on the  reading  of the pictorial work. Area: Europe in the fifteenth century”   <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>. Although his library was comprehensive, it focused on specific geographic regions and times, namely Europe and the Renaissance, and thus mainly neglected images of non-Western cultures. This is further indicated in his introduction to the  <em>Mnemosyne Atlas</em>  written in the late 1920s; the text presents Warburg’s thoughts on  “social memory, the origin of artistic expression and the psychological drama driving the history of European culture from classical antiquity onwards”   <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>. Although Warburg’s  <em>Atlas</em>  utilized a restricted and mostly consistent number of images, it remains an important attempt and role model for current visualization techniques and research attempts: he not only viewed the single image but placed it within a larger artistic network to make sense of visual continuities, to identify and understand similarities between artworks, which testify to artistic relationships and adaptation processes. The latter referring to the circulation of distinct motifs, compositions, styles and other visual properties over time and space.</p>
<p>The process of linking to find analogies is a central human behavior and studied in detail by neuroscience. To make sense of new experiences and impressions, our brain also uses associations: Neuroscientist Moshe Bar emphasizes the importance of analogies for associations and consequently to make predictions of the future. Bar proposes a framework which studies how the human brain  “&hellip;generates proactive predictions that facilitate our interactions with the environment&hellip;”   <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>. He proposes that incoming information is not analyzed isolated in order to be understood, but that links between new and existing, already familiar information are used to make sense of the unknown. Like Warburg, Bar’s theory is based on the presence of analogies and the search for similar information stored in our memory. He famously declared that when seeing a new object, we should not ask What is this? but rather What is this like?  <sup id="fnref1:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>. Essentially the concept of linking is central for computer science: section four illustrates how computational methods based on neural networks find visual correspondences automatically; but even earlier data models are interested in links. The ER-model for example models entities and their relationships, both of which are expressed in a given data collection <sup id="fnref4:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. The model considers various possible relationships, namely one-to-one, many-to-one or many-to-many relationships. The example  <em>Secretary (entity) works for engineer (entity)</em>  indicates one-to-many relationships: While every engineer can have only one secretary, a secretary can work for multiple engineers. This diagram is further enriched by adding descriptive attributes to entities such as name, color, or height <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Both methods proposed by Warburg and Bush established links manually and based on knowledge which the scholar had prior to his research. Warburg’s  <em>Atlas</em>  was mainly used to visualize his arguments and hypotheses. Thus most visual links were already known or at least suspected and therefore produced little new knowledge. In contrast, computational methods establish links automatically and independently of the art historian. Doing so, these methods hold the potential to identify links between thousands of artworks, which have not been known by art historians before. In addition new approaches overcome spatial limitations which characterize previous visualization techniques such as Warburg’s  <em>Mnemosyne Atlas</em> . Thus, art historians are able to establish comprehensive relations between artists, determine influences and the adaptation of motifs or styles by different artists. Accessing and exploring data collections through linking means that the artwork is not studied in isolation but always seen in comparison to others; by searching for predecessors or successors, scholars aim to make sense of short-term and long-lasting phenomena in the history of art. Where and how did a motif such as the skull evolve? In which context was it presented? Can we find predecessors for the Cubist style? These and similar questions can be answered by establishing visual links. The idea of linking is extended by, for example, hyperlinks, where connections to other data even of different media can be established simply by clicking — the internet consists of such hyperlinks.</p>
<p>Warburg’s  <em>Mnemosyne Atlas</em>  has shown how the process of linking allows us to open up image collections of art, thereby creating visual trails and lines of continuity. The idea of linking was taken up by Bush for his memex device which was intended to operate on associations and therefore resembled the workings of the human mind <sup id="fnref1:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>. What has been performed by Warburg to a limited extent and only hypothesized by Bush has become reality through computational methods: thousands of art images can be visualized in one space, thereby revealing visual patterns common in essentially distant artworks. Consequently past works can only provide suggestions, guidelines and validations for current practices in the digital humanities, because the physicality of photographic reproductions and space limitations do not resemble current conditions.</p>
<p>Previous sections have provided more information about how computational methods are beneficial to access and link images; this last paragraph focuses on the aspect of editing. Eventually the combination of digital data and computational methods enables an editing of images. The format and reproducibility of digital images allow the modification of images without actually altering the physical artwork. One can change formal features such as color, saturation, brightness, contrast with easily available editing programs such as AdobePhotoshop. Art historians are thus able to improve the quality of reproductions or study the importance of color, etc., for an artwork. Through image editing, scholars might also crop digital images to compare details or reconstruct the hanging of artworks in past exhibitions in a digital space to study viewing practices or exhibition contexts. More complex computational methods such as style transfer or image synthesis, which are introduced in the following section, describe a more conspicuous editing of digital images. Recent works by Gatys et al. and Sanakoyeu et al. have used computational models to stylize a real photo in the style of a specific artist, this process is referred to as style transfer in computer vision <sup id="fnref1:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref3:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Visual features of a style such as color, object shape, texture and brushstroke are learnt by a neural network and transferred onto the real image. Image stylization thus holds the potential to generate new perspectives and visualize how an artist would have painted a modern scene. Generative models which are used for style transfer also offer the potential to generate unseen views of an object by for example synthesizing two images. Through image generation, lost, damaged or unfinished artworks can be reconstructed, producing new knowledge for art history. Both examples indicate that generative models enable an editing of images unimaginable with analog data or analog methods.</p>
<p>Previous sections have identified the potentials of using computer technologies for accessing, linking and editing images. The discussion has highlighted that methods to access collections or link images based on visual similarities have already been suggested by art history and studied by other fields such as neuroscience. While these attempts provide valuable guidelines for current computational methods, examples given in the next section emphasize that models based on neural networks exceed previous attempts by far.</p>
<h2 id="4-examples-of-how-computer-models-assist-with-data-analysis">4. Examples of how computer models assist with data analysis</h2>
<p>Computational methods based on neural networks can access, link and edit digital images in an innovative way, thus enabling a large-scale analysis of art datasets, which is adaptive to individual research questions, or offering new perspectives of the art object. These methods include search engines for object retrieval or visualization techniques which spot overarching links between images based on visual similarities — often unknown to art historians — or perform a comprehensive study of image context. Doing so they process thousands of images in a short amount of time and do not rely on descriptive image labels but operate on a purely visual basis. By allowing to alter style properties or the shape of the digital object, crop details or recreate missing parts virtually, methods for image generation offer new perspectives of the art object. Thus art historians can study for example the impact of these changes to the meaning of the art object. The following section provides concrete examples which demonstrate these potentials in practice and highlight that computational methods significantly impact our existing research culture:  “Techniques of computational analysis can be used to reveal features of art historical artifacts in novel ways. These allow us to rethink the identity, purpose, use, and substance of objects”   <sup id="fnref6:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Computational methods truly alter the discipline of art history and exemplify the process from a digitized to a computational art history, thereby producing new knowledge unattainable with analog methods. In comparison to analog methods which only consider a small set of images, computational methods are capable to process thousands of images in a short amount of time and produce an accurate image representation. Since the advance of deep learning in circa 2015 <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup> 3, convolutional neural networks, which resemble the human brain, are preferably used in state-of-the-art computer vision to perform tasks such as classification, object detection <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> or finding visual similarities or patterns in large data collections <sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. While the human eye views images one-by-one, pairwise or in small groups, the computer is able to perceive thousands of images at the same time. The following tasks employ convolutional networks to perform a large-scale analysis and answer questions about form and content of the artwork or artistic style.</p>
<p>If we want to access data through a visual search, we have to have a clear understanding of what to search for. However, if one is unable to define a specific search query yet, computer-based approaches still give access to large data collections: Lev Manovich has demonstrated how the visualization of thousands of images in one space can lead to new insights. To automatically measure a number of visual characteristics of manga images and compare them respectively, Manovich et al. use digital image processing. For every image, algorithms calculate, for example, the portion of certain colors, saturation, contrast or texture and use these values to create a 2D visualization of images. Visualizations then show images arranged according to these values: images with similar values are displayed closely in the feature space, whereas dissimilar images are more distant. Consequently depending on the selected feature, visualizations of images differ and present various views of the data <sup id="fnref2:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. In his essay  “How to compare one million images?”  Manovich emphasizes that a manual study of a handful of images only enhances drastic changes between images. A computational analysis, based on calculated values, considers millions of images and also recognizes subtle changes in form and content. Manovich and his digital lab demonstrate that by visualizing data in a digital space, scholars are given an overview of the structure of a dataset to identify popular but also uncommon visual characteristics in images running through a considerable part of art <sup id="fnref3:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. Although we are not using a specific image as a starting point for comparison or formulate a visual search query, we are able to access a large dataset simply by visualizing it.</p>
<p>Another visualization example shows a grouping of digital images according to a user-defined similarity. In Figure 3 images were sorted according to age and social status. Given some instances which display these characteristics, the neural network learnt to cluster the remaining images accordingly. Indeed the visualization shows that painted portraits display a variance in age and social status; this grouping is visible along the vertical and horizontal line. This way, art historians might study conventions of portraiture throughout time for certain age and social groups or identify uncommon depictions.</p>

<p>The search for recurring motifs and compositions in order to identify relations between artists or the recurring adaptation of motifs and styles are core tasks of art historians and chores which cannot be performed manually for large datasets. Much effort has been spent on developing computational methods for an object and content based search in digital datasets <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Results include interactive interfaces and search engines which allow users to access individual collections and search for specific objects, compositions or other image regions to study their form and content. These retrieval systems are used to study medieval manuscripts <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>, prints, architectural drawings <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>, collections of paintings or photographs of exhibitions <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. The Computer Vision Group at Heidelberg University developed an interactive retrieval system (see Figure 4) to perform a multiple object search in large image collections. In contrast to other tools, the search is performed on visual input and does not require text annotations, which are error-prone and tedious to obtain <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>. The system thus enables a search for previously unknown or not indexed object categories. As Manovich stated  “&hellip;we will not be able to give names to all of the variations of textures, compositions, lines, and shapes used even in a single chapter of Abara [a Japanese manga], let alone one million manga pages. We can proceed with traditional approaches so long as we limit ourselves to discussing manga iconography and other distinct visual elements which have standardized shapes and meanings”   <sup id="fnref4:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. However art historians also aim to find less standardized, uncommon elements in artworks, which have not been considered or defined by scholars before. As Manovich suggests, to find these uncommon traits is one great value of computational methods.</p>

</figure>
<p>On the basis of individually user-defined queries (up to five) the system utilizes neural networks to find identical and similar objects and parts in images (see Figure 5), which might not have been annotated beforehand. Since users can find multiple objects in artworks, the system is able to perform an iconographic analysis of artworks: we might search for specific subjects which require a certain arrangement of objects, such as the Adoration of Christ or Christ’s Crucifixion, and find variations of it. The system encourages users to give feedback and to judge detection results, pick favorites or rearrange search results. The search for user-selected objects and motifs in large datasets demonstrates the significance to develop explicitly computer-based methods for digital images. These methods do not require annotations but are unsupervised meaning that they do not require labels to find objects or visual patterns in data; input images are given without any corresponding output variables.</p>
<p>By finding identical or similar objects in large image collections given a user-defined query, art historians are able to study form developments or changes in context over a great period of time or produce new image connections. The search engine thus produces new knowledge, because neural networks process thousands of images and transform images into visual representations; consequently unknown links are build without human intervention. In addition users can create multiple trails consisting of the same images and are able to enlarge existing links by adding more images. The process of linking digitized images based on similarities resembles the manual approach of Warburg, however significantly exceeding his capabilities.</p>
<p>Although we have emphasized that online repositories are also selections and not available to everyone, search engines benefit from the availability of large, digital image collections. On this basis, enginessignificantly enhance research in art history, for example the study of adaptation processes or the tightness of artistic networks. The individual digital object can be placed within many visual trails or networks, emphasizing its multiple functions and changing meaning in different contexts. Moreover the identification of links is not restricted to art historians, who know about visual patterns in art history, but performable by a wider audience.</p>

<p>The ability to edit images without actually altering the physical artwork is one advantage of digital data. While image editing programs such as Adobe Photoshop enable to cut details, change saturation or color very easily, thus providing knowledge about the impact of these changes for the presence and meaning of the art object, generative models first introduced by Goodfellow et al. perform a more compelling and drastic editing of images <sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. In fact we can generate new perspectives of images or entirely new images. In order to reproduce the data and its specific properties, neural networks in generative models have to produce a data representation, which is a close approximation of the real data distribution. In contrast to discriminative models, which aim to classify data given certain features to predict a label, generative algorithms predict features on the basis of given labels:  “GANs construct images, first generating arrangements of scene labels, filling in object labels from the scene labels, and then placing detail texture according to these sets of labels. In other words, GAN generator nets have learned how to plausibly compose objects together in scenes and to texture the object parts, following the instructions encoded in the vector”   <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>. Eventually generative models obtain a detailed understanding of the data and perceive information about what is depicted and in which manner.</p>

<p>Generative models are capable to imitate the gaze of a person, for example the view of an artist, which is expressed in his or her paintings. The so-called style transfer describes the stylization of a real photo in the style of an artist such as Claude Monet (1840-1926) or Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890). Gatys et al. utilized a neural network for stylization: a real photo and a style example are given to the network; during processing the networks learns to retain the content of the photo but gradually approximating the style of the style example <sup id="fnref2:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. This iterative process has been discarded by recent approaches for style transfer, which utilize GANs to improve image quality and style representation <sup id="fnref4:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. However for both approaches a neural network learns the specifics of a style based on an individual style sample <sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> or a collection of images <sup id="fnref5:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and transfers these learnt features to the real photo, thus generating a new image in the style of a specific artist. Research papers have argued that in order to generate a convincing stylization, it is better to use a collection of images since one example cannot fully comprehend and represent an artist’s style <sup id="fnref6:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. For example a landscape painting of Monet might accentuate different style features, such as color, brushstroke or shape, than a portrait in the same style. In order to replicate artistic style convincingly, networks have to consider these variations. Other works also focused on speeding up the stylization process <sup id="fnref2:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> or aimed to have more control over style transfer, determining the degree of stylization, select target regions, or combine multiple styles as input for one image <sup id="fnref1:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>. Figure 6 shows the frontal view of a two-story house with surrounding garden. When given the task to paint the respective scene, an artist changes the color of the house and accentuates the contours of the transom windows; another artist highlights the flora in the foreground and blurs the contours of the house so that only a silhouette can be seen.</p>

<p>Resulting images are representative of the subjective, very personal views of artists and provide information about personal and historical preferences and how the appearance of the scene differs for varying styles. Figure 7 shows stylizations of the same content image for artists Paul Cézanne (1839-1906), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938), Picasso (1881-1973) and Claude Monet (1840-1926). The stylized image in the style of Cézanne and generated by <sup id="fnref3:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> is enlarged in Figure 8. The example gives an impression of how the artist would have painted the house; it shows characteristics which are prominent in his works from the late 1870s on onwards: black outlines, earthy tones and monochromatic image regions. By comparing all stylizations, we can study how style affects content and the appearance of the image. Kirchner’s preference for bold, vibrant colors and vertical shapes creates a threatening impression. The house appears to be on fire and slowly dissolving; this visual effect is highlighted by the deformed windows. In contrast, the pure and pastel colors and pointillist brushstroke of Monet creates a spring-like and certainly lighter atmosphere. The outlines of the house are less accentuated and blend with the background. The style transfer performed by Kotovenko et al. specifically focuses on how style affects image content and alters fine image details such as the human figure or other objects in an artist-specific manner (see Figure 9) <sup id="fnref4:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Style transfer does not remain a simple application for computer vision but has great relevance for art historical research. Art historians thus obtain new knowledge by asking:  <em>What is style? Which properties define an artist’s style? How does style affect content? How important are color, shape or brushstroke for an object? How does contemporary taste manifest itself in formal attributes?</em>  Style transfer thus triggers a renewed style discussion which is built on broad observations about artistic style as well as small visual details magnified through stylizations.</p>

<p>“Techniques of computational analysis can be used to reveal features of art historical artifacts in novel ways. These allow us to rethink the identity, purpose, use, and substance of objects”   <sup id="fnref7:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Style transfer presented a method which generates a new image by transferring formal properties, learnt from style examples, to a real photo and thus creating multiple views on one scene. Generative models then possess the ability to edit images in a novel way. Computational methods can go a step further and synthesize two images, altering the appearance of one object by adapting formal characteristics of the other <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Figure 10 illustrates the synthesis of a person’s appearance with the shape of another:  “to synthesize different geometrical layouts or change the appearance of an object, either shape or appearance can be retained from a query image, whereas the other component can be freely altered or even imputed from other images”   <sup id="fnref3:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. To do so underlying algorithms have first learnt an exact representation of shape and appearance of an object in respective images. In the same manner, less complex objects such as shoes, bags or other clothing items can be manipulated. Computer models thus create images of different shoe types, displaying diverse colors or materials. Eventually these generated images which are still static can be brought to life <sup id="fnref4:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>: by animating the object, the method allows an additional and alternative view, producing new knowledge about the artifact: how do different angles or motion impact the perception of the object? Moreover generative methods can be used to learn the behavior or control movements of a person. An activity such jumping rope is shown in a target video. The video data is used to train neural networks which then represent the appearance of a person and respective motion sequences. Based on this learning process the movement is transferred to another person (see Figure 11). In consequence, the process describes a synthesis of appearance and movement, instead of appearance and static pose as previously performed by <a href="#esser2018a">Esser et al. (2018a)</a>. Similar to style transfer, image synthesis produces new knowledge about the artifact by altering its shape or appearance with computational methods. It creates unseen views, highlights the specific characteristics of an object or style and presents the object in motion, thus giving new insights into the structure of an object or qualities of natural movement.</p>

<h2 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>This essay focused on digital data and computational methods and how a combination of both transforms information inherent in digital data into new knowledge. In order to do so we must involve transformative processes, namely from analog to digital data, from analog to digital methods and eventually from digital to computational methods. We argued that the specific characteristics of digital data, being for example reproducible or modifiable, require new computational methods different to analog methods. While analog methods such as Warburg’s  <em>Atlas</em>  or Bush’s suggested memex device provide valuable impulses, they can only give guidelines, suggestions and validations for computer-based approaches, because they were established under different conditions and mostly required knowledge about the expected outcome. Therefore, it is not enough to simply simulate known approaches but to develop new methods which are capable of performing these tasks with minimum or no human intervention. By considering the specifics of digital data, new computational methods offer a quantitative as well as a qualitative analysis of image repositories. Neural networks, which form the basis of current methods, automatically create links between thousands of images, allow to trace the adaptation of motifs or styles over a considerable amount of time and in various media, reveal analogies between images previously undiscovered or find local trends only shared by few artists. Manovich’s visualizations of thousands of manga images or the search engine for objects and compositions in large datasets by the Computer Vision Group demonstrate how computational methods enable a simplified and explorative access to collections to study these visual patterns. This article also introduced generative models and their ability to significantly edit and alter images on the basis of a detailed data understanding. Models capture and transfer artistic styles, thus rendering a real photo in the style of an artist, generate new views or entirely new objects by synthesizing shape and appearance. Art historians are thus propelled to study the specific characteristics of styles or how a change in shape impacts the appearance and meaning of the (art) object. Given examples demonstrate the great potentials, when art historians and computer scientists work together.</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict how the future of digital humanities will look like or where changes might lead. Future works however must address and reduce the skepticism towards computational methods and emphasize the general value of the work of the other discipline. Any efforts in this direction are beneficial and mark a positive change. This can be done by further encouraging collaborations and future research projects should aim to make image processing more transparent and machine learning understandable. So far computer scientists have relatively little insight into what happens during image processing in neural networks. In recent years research papers studied which regions are seen by the network when producing an image caption <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup> or produced a representation of the image content during style transfer, illustrating how much content is preserved for a specific style by the computer model <sup id="fnref7:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. More efforts must be spend to study the behavior of neural networks during image processing so that art historians are able to understand errors and give valuable feedback to computer scientists. Information or even hypotheses about why an image was classified incorrectly or why the network established a link between images can lead to an improvement of computational methods. Computer scientists are able to make corrections to models and assure that computational methods improve equally to the increasing amount and demands of digital data and become even more efficient for art historical research. We must further introduce seminars to the regular art history curriculum at universities, which teach on the usage of computational methods and provide an understanding of basic computational operations. This excludes the subject of digital humanities already taught at some universities. In addition we must communicate to students from computer science, how they can benefit from a collaboration: art data evokes new challenges due to different styles and new object categories and thus supports the development of robust algorithms. Style transfer for example not only requires an understanding of what is shown in the image but also in which manner. By teaching about digital possibilities and a cooperation, we not only reduce skepticism but create a new generation of researchers, who value a collaboration. Until then, we must further propel collaborations between researchers from computer vision and art history and make methods more accessible; so far only a limited number of people — mostly academics — have access to methods and tools. Not least the survey conducted by Emily L. Spratt and Ahmed Elgammal in 2014 indicated that we are on the right path. Authors concluded that art historians generally  “wished they knew more about the movement of artificial intelligence into the humanities — or the attention to art history by computer scientists, of which half the group surveyed indicated that they were interested to get direct feedback from art historians as they developed new applications for computer vision technology”   <sup id="fnref4:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>.</p>

<li>The  <em>Time Machine Project</em>  originated out of the Venice Time Machine, which was initiated by Fréderic Kaplan and his team at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. It aims to sketch the history of Venice and its evolution over a period of thousand years. See the project page for more information: <a href="https://timemachine.eu/">https://timemachine.eu/</a> (accessed March 23, 2019).</li>
<li>Generative models based on neural networks are used to learn explicit data distributions of training sets without any supervision. Data distributions consist of mathematical functions which show all values of the data. Based on learnt distribution, models generate new data points which show slight variations to the original data. By learning the particularities of the data and producing new data points, models are able to alter for example the shape or appearance of objects presented in images or transfer artistic style to real photos. The two most common generative models are Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The VAE approach can learn a complex data distribution such as images without any human supervision using neural networks <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>. The autoencoder encodes  “an input image to a much smaller dimensional representation which can store&hellip; information about the input data distribution”   <sup id="fnref1:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup> and on this basis learns to generate similar looking images. A full mathematical explanation of VAEs is given in the tutorial by <a href="#doersch2016">Doersch (2016)</a>. In contrast the GAN framework consists of two adversarial components, namely a generator and a discriminator. While the former learns to capture the data distribution, the latter must estimate if an image sample came from the generator or real data distribution. GANs were first introduced by <a href="#goodfellow2014">Goodfellow et al. (2014)</a>.</li>
<li>Deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning. Deep learning methods allow to learn representations of large datasets with different degrees of abstraction. These methods achieve state-of-the-art results in tasks such as classification, speech recognition or visual object recognition. (Convolutional) neural networks are large computing systems used in deep learning, which are inspired by biological neural networks and consist of multiple stages. At every stage the network extracts intermediate features from images: while low-level features encapsulate information about color, shape or edges, deeper stages contain high level information about semantically abstract concepts such as nose, eyes or faces and geometrical relations. Essentially, these features are descriptions of an image and are required to understand the image and to extract information relevant for solving a given task (i.e., object recognition) <sup id="fnref1:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>.</li>
<li>The research project  <em>Bilderfahrzeuge: Aby Warburg’s Legacy and the Future of Iconology</em>  explores the migration of images, objects , etc., on the basis of Warburg’s theories. It studies the transfer of image concepts and also focuses on the image itself. The project theme is material images but also includes linguistic images and studies the access, treatment and use of images in different disciplines such as literature, the humanities and science.

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Πάντα ῥεῖ. Everything is subjected to the inexorable law of change: the reality, the categories through which we organize it and the words we use to talk about it.</p>
<p>This is particularly the case for the history of science. Over the centuries, scholars have built different theoretical models in response to the continuous innovation that emerged from observation sometimes producing a real scientific revolution in the worldview. Needless to say, a change in conceptual level often corresponds to a change in terminology<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> : new terms can be introduced to express the new system of concepts or old terms can be dismissed when the concept becomes obsolete. The aim of this article is to present a model for formally representing the diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a given domain, so that this formalization can be machine-actionable. Taking advantage from past experiences conducted in the context of several projects<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> , we propose here an approach based on Semantic Web technologies that guarantees interoperability and reuse of diachronic terminological resources across scientific communities.</p>
<p>The development of standards for representing and exchanging data has always been a concern in the terminological field. Interoperability across terminological formats is basically ensured by adopting the ISO standard 30042: 2008 TBX (TermBase eXchange), an XML-based family of terminology exchange formats compliant with the Terminological Markup Framework (TMF - ISO 16642: 2003).</p>
<p>Over the last few years, interesting solutions for interoperability have been offered by the Semantic Web technologies and the Linked Open Data initiative which allow data to be shared, reused across applications and linked with the resources available on the Web, thus benefiting from the whole datacloud of URIs with which reference resources like DBpedia are already networked.</p>
<p>In terminology, there has been a growing trend towards representing and publishing terminological resources on the Semantic Web according to Linked Open Data principles, as demonstrated for example by the NCBO (National Center for Biomedical Ontology) BioPortal, a repository of more than 300 biomedical ontologies and terminologies converted into RDF <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>; or by the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> aiming to create a family of new or extant ontologies based on shared principles compliant with the Semantic Web technologies. These and other similar initiatives are all driven by the same need, namely to avoid that terminologies, created by proprietary software, exist independently of each other, hidden in isolated databases. The lack of semantic interoperability, indeed, precludes any possibility of progress, as medical data can be exploited to their full potential only if they are interconnected to each other. Sharing large quantities of data structured in ontologies makes it possible to use IT applications and artificial intelligence systems, enabling thus better diagnostics, early disease prevention and, more generally, a deeper understanding of the human biology and health.</p>
<p>Another initiative deserving to be mentioned is the EuroVoc management based on technologies in line with W3C recommendations and with the latest developments in classification standards. A collaborative project started in 2019 and undertaken by the Publications Office of the European Union and the International Labour Office <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> aims to align EuroVoc with other controlled vocabularies and publish them as Linked Open Data. The objective is to improve data accessibility and guarantee large-scale interoperability, thus facilitating the authoring-translating-publishing chain as well as the work in public administrations and international organisations.</p>
<p>Finally, Cimiano et al. (<a href="#cimiano2015">2015</a>) proposed an approach to convert terminological datasets originally stored in TBX format to RDF by means of an online service named TBX2RDF, allowing thereby terminological resources to be used and enhanced across different scientific communities and, in particular, to become part of the great Linguistic Linked (Open) Data cloud (see infra).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as we shall see, using these technologies to represent the diachronic evolution of terminological and conceptual data constitutes an interesting challenge, since OWL (Web Ontology Language), the W3C standard language developed to represent ontologies in the Semantic Web, is fundamentally static and monotonic.</p>
<h2 id="2-terminology-and-diachrony">2. Terminology and Diachrony</h2>
<p>In the terminological literature, the diachronic dimension has been neglected for a long time. This was mainly due to the onomasiological, prescriptive and static approach underlying the General Theory of Terminology (GTT) elaborated by Wüster in 1968.</p>
<p>Wüster’s approach to terminology was based on a neo-positivist referential and taxonomic semiotics <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, according to which concepts take precedence over words. In GTT terms are monosemic and concepts are monoreferential; a perfect correspondence is established between them: each concept corresponds to one and only one term. The term is thus equivalent to a symbol, to a  “désignateur rigide”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, since it works in much the same way as the system of proper names works in general language. Conceptual structures, on the other hand, are regarded as universal and static like their referents and any diachronic dimension is neutralised.</p>
<p>In outlining the theoretical and methodological differences between lexicology and terminology, Cabré (<a href="#cabre1999">1999: 8</a>) emphasized that terminology is only concerned with synchronic aspects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This view, which today is considered the most systematic, coherent theoretical approach to terms, differs from lexicological theory in three ways: in the priority of the concept over the designation; in being exclusively concerned with the level of the terminological unit and not with the other levels of linguistic description; in excluding any diachronic approach of information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terminology began to open up to diachrony timidly after the  “odyssée terminotique”   <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> of the 80s, when an impressive number of term banks, based on the synchronic traditional vision of the Viennese school, were produced and spread (EURODICAUTOM, NORMATERM, UNITERM, TERMIUM, IATE etc.). In 1988 a symposium entitled  “Terminologie diachronique”  was organized by the  <em>Centre de Terminologie</em>  of Bruxelles, but ten years after Møller (1998) still regretted a  “quantitative and / or qualitative deficit”  in that branch of terminology for which he coined the neologism  “terminochronie” . Over the last twenty years several studies have been conducted focussing on the evolution of concepts and terms in specialized languages (see inter al. <a href="#vancampenhoudt1997">van Campenhoudt 1997</a>, <a href="#dury2008">Dury 2008</a>, <a href="#zanola2014">Zanola 2014</a>, <a href="#kristiansen2014">Kristiansen 2014</a>), as well as on methods for compiling diachronic corpora <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> and identifying the evolution of knowledge in corpora <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As underlined by Dury and Picton (<a href="#dury2009">2009</a>), this lack of interest for diachronic aspects in terminology was mainly due to technical, pragmatic, psychological, and most of all theoretical and historical obstacles. Diachronic terminology is, indeed, by definition a textual terminology <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, a terminology of  “discourse” . Terms must be analysed in their real context of use and must not be seen as abstract and static labels associated with concepts. They should be rather regarded as linguistic signs, which enter into a dynamic relationship both with the concepts and with the other linguistic signs that constitute the terminological system. In a diachronic perspective, terminological work is fundamentally semasiological and descriptive. In order to grasp terminological variation over time, the starting point is the sense that a term acquires within a real linguistic context and the focus is on language as it is actually used (Ist-Norm) in real specialised (con-)texts and not on language as it should be used (Soll-Norm). To use Bourigault and Slodzian words (<a href="#bourigault1999">1999: 31</a>),  “le texte est le point de départ de la description lexicale à construire. On va du texte vers le terme” .</p>
<p>Texts are usually the unique source that the scholars have at their disposal in order to access disappeared states of languages and more completely understand the history of terms and their evolution over time. Texts play a crucial role to establish when and how words acquire (terminologization) and lose (determinologization) their terminological status, or how a term passes from one specialized field to another or from the intimate pages of a scholar to the entire scientific community.</p>
<p>Regarding this last aspect, in particular, texts constitute a precious means to record the typical terminological fluctuation that precedes or follows the formation of the so-called  “normal science”  state. As a matter of fact, in a phase of  “normal science” , when the development of knowledge is adherent to what Kuhn (<a href="#kuhn1970">1970</a>) calls  “paradigm” , the system of terms is standard, explicitly defined and consensually used within a scientific community. In revolutionary phases, on the contrary, when a revision of existing scientific beliefs or practices is involved, terminology can be characterized by great instability. Texts become thus a conceptual and terminological space of creativity, where scholars think, reflect and give a linguistic form to their ideas. In these cases, ephemeral lexical formations are often attested only in the idiolect of the one who forged them without ever taking root within the scientific community.</p>
<p>An example of this phenomenon will be illustrated in Section 6 with Ferdinand de Saussure’s terminology.</p>
<h2 id="3-modelling-an-interoperable-terminological-resource">3. Modelling an Interoperable Terminological Resource</h2>
<p>When modelling a digital scholarly resource, the key point is to choose a model capable of maximizing its usefulness in the community of reference. According to the  “FAIR guidelines” , scholarly data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. First of all, for data to be findable, they must be referred to using a globally unique and persistent identifier and must also be indexed in a searchable resource. Furthermore, data must be accessible through a standardized protocol and, at the same time, has to be interoperable in virtue of its representation in a formal and shared knowledge representation language. Finally, to be reusable, data must be  “described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes”  (<a href="#wilkinson2016">ibidem: 4</a>).</p>
<p>In order to pursue the FAIR policies and to build fair diachronic terminological resources, our choice was to adopt the paradigms of Semantic Web technologies <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> and Linked (Open) Data <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The intuition behind the Semantic Web is to shift from a Web of documents, viewed as separate data silos containing unstructured or semi-structured data, to a Web of data where open repositories of semantically enriched data can be accessed and interlinked. To make this vision concrete, the following technologies - often referred to as the Semantic Web layer cake or Semantic Web technology - are used: Resource Description Framework<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS), Web Ontology Language (OWL), Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL).</p>
<p>Semantic Web and Linked (Open) Data best practices require datasets to be published using RDF: data is described as triples in the form of Subject - Predicate - Object, where the Subject is a resource, the Object can be either a resource or a data value (such as a string of character or a number), and the Predicate (also called  “property” ) relates the Subject and the Object together. Basically, a dataset in the Linked Data world is a set of triples.</p>
<p>OWL is a family of languages, based on RDF/XML, and recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium since 2004 for representing and sharing ontologies<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  on the Web. There are three variants of OWL, with different levels of expressiveness: OWL Lite, which supports a classification hierarchy and simple constraints; OWL DL, which provides the maximum expressiveness while retaining computational completeness and decidability, and OWL Full which allows for maximum expressiveness, resulting nonetheless undecidable.</p>
<p>In order to publish structured data on the Web in a way that they can be easily linked to each other, a number of rules was set up by Berners-Lee, known as Linked (Open) Data principles. According to them, each entity of a dataset must be uniquely identified by a special  “address”  called URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), each URI must be available on the Web via the HTTP protocol<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> , each look up of a URI must be answered with useful information and using standards, and finally, whenever possible, data should be linked to other data.</p>
<p>Over the last years, the Linked (Open) Data approach has attracted the attention of a linguistic community becoming more and more sensitive to the question of interoperability between resources. An increasing number of openly available and interconnected linguistic datasets have been published as part of the Web of data, resulting in the so-called Linked Open Data Cloud (LLOD). This trend, nicely visualised in <a href="https://lod-cloud.net">https://lod-cloud.net</a>, is particularly boosted by the Ontology Lexicon (Ontolex) community group, whose activity resulted in the creation of  <em>lemon</em> <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  (Lexicon Model for Ontologies), a meta-model allowing lexical resources to be published in RDF, linked and shared according to Semantic Web principles. At present  <em>lemon</em>  constitutes a standard de facto, as it is grounded on W3C and ISO standards, such as LMF (Lexical Markup Framework) <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, Lexinfo <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> – this latter aligned with ISOCat - and LIR (Linguistic Information Repository) <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>Lemon</em>  has been successfully adopted in many different contexts for different purposes, such as, for example, to publish several existing lexical resources as linked data, including DBnary <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, the Parole-Simple-Clips Italian lexicon <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, WordNet <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, UBY <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> and BabelNet <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, to represent linguistic resources for sentiment analysis within the EuroSentiment project <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>, to model linguistic annotations in FrameBase, a linked open knowledge base which integrates and interconnects heterogeneous sources of structured knowledge <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The  <em>lemon</em>  core module, named  <em>ontoLex</em> <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> , is composed of three fundamental elements: i) the  <em>Lexical Entry</em>  class, in turn specified in  <em>Word</em> ,  <em>Multiword Expression</em> , and  <em>Affix</em> ; ii) the  <em>Lexical Form</em>  class where the morphological variants of a lexical entry are described and associated with a written representation ( <em>writtenRep</em> ); iii) the  <em>Lexical Sense</em>  class, which constitutes the reification of the relationship between a lexical entry and an ontology entity defined in a given  “external”  ontology. In  <em>lemon</em> , in fact, concepts, conceived as extra-linguistic entities, receive a formal and explicit description in a separate ontology, according to the principle known as  “semantics by reference”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The  <em>lemon</em>  model has been designed to be modular and extensible: in other words, new modules can be created, if required, to represent a peculiar aspect of a lexical or terminological resource. To manage semantic shifts, for example, a diachronic extension, called  <em>lemonDIA</em> , was developed <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="4-models-and-tools-for-the-representation-of-diachrony">4. Models and Tools for the Representation of Diachrony</h2>
<p>Knowledge representation languages underlying Semantic Web technologies are based on binary relations. They typically connect two instances without any temporal information, thus making the representation of time a difficult matter to deal with. In order to tackle this issue, different approaches have been proposed in the literature (see inter al. <a href="#flouris2008">Flouris 2008</a>, <a href="#makri2011">Makri 2011</a>): Temporal Description logics <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>, Versioning <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>, Reification <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> and 4D-fluents <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. In the following, a brief description of each approach is provided.</p>
<p><em>Temporal Description Logics (TDL</em> ). Description logics (DLs) <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> are a family of knowledge representation formalisms underlying the Ontology Web Language (OWL-DL). They are a decidable subset of first-order logic. TDLs extend DL with standard temporal logic operators such as  “always in the future” , and  “until” . Many TDLs have been proposed in the literature <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> with the most expressive of them being undecidable. Extending DL entails to extend OWL, which is based on DL. Since OWL is a W3C recommendation (2004) for publishing and sharing ontologies in a  “Semantic Web vision” , adopting TDL would entail to abandon the Semantic Web framework. On the contrary, the other approaches described in the following can be implemented using OWL directly.</p>
<p><em>Versioning</em> . Another strategy commonly adopted to handle and keep track of ontology modifications in time is versioning: whenever a change takes place, a new version of the resource is created (see Figure 1). Several works are grounded on this approach: Grandi (<a href="#grandi2009">2009</a>) presents a multi-temporal RDF database model employing triple timestamping with temporal elements; Zekri et al. (<a href="#zekri2017">2017</a>) present an infrastructure and a suite of tools to support the creation and validation of OWL ontologies with time-varying instances; in Tappolet and Bernstein (<a href="#tappolet2009">2009</a>), the usage of Named Graphs is proposed.</p>
<p>The drawback of versioning approach is mainly twofold. Firstly, the fact that a new version of the whole resource needs to be created every time a change occurs leads to redundant information. Secondly, the more numerous the versions of the resource are, the more complex and time-consuming the performance of exhaustive searches becomes.</p>

<p><em>Reification</em> . Reification is a technique for representing relationships with arity greater than two.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  Reifying a relationship means representing it as a class of entities.

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 2(a) illustrates how the reification process works: the relation  <em>denotes</em>  is transformed into a class, here named  <em>Reified relation</em> . The subject and the object of  <em>denotes</em> , as well as the relation itself, become the attributes of the new class. Let us suppose that the relation  <em>denotes</em>  links a term ti (in particular its specific sense) to a concept cj at a specific time T0. As shown in Figure 2(b), the relationship  <em>denotes</em> (ti, cj, T0) can be reified as the new class  <em>DenotationEvent</em>  with three binary relations:  <em>denotes</em> (ti, de),  <em>denotes</em> (de, cj), and  <em>time</em> (de, T0). The first two relations link ti to cj by means of de, which is an instance of the class  <em>DenotationEvent</em> . The third relation assigns a temporal extent T0 to de, representing the temporal validity of the original property  <em>denotes</em> (ti, cj).</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of this technique are that: i) the complexity of the ontology increases due to the proliferation of entities, both classes and properties (as a matter of fact, whenever a temporal relation has to be represented, a new object is created); ii) the OWL reasoning capabilities become limited <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> and can be maintained only by means of time-consuming strategies, since the reified property is transformed into a class and the characteristics which can be added to a property in OWL (such as functionality, inverse functionality, transitivity or symmetry) are no longer associated directly with the relation itself.</p>
<p><em>4D-fluents (four-dimensionalist).</em>  The basic idea underlying this approach is that each entity has a temporal part, described by a set of time slices. Each slice represents a temporal period, in which all the features of an entity remain constant. Changes affect the properties of the temporal part keeping the entity unchanged. In order to add the time dimension to a resource, the  <em>TimeSlice</em>  and  <em>TimeInterval</em>  classes with the  <em>timeSliceOf</em>  and  <em>timeInterval</em>  properties need to be introduced, as Figure 3 depicts. Returning to the previous example, in the 4D-fluents approach, the property  <em>denotes</em>  would connect instances of the  <em>TimeSlice</em>  class and would hold between slices of entities. The time slices of an entity have a specific lifetime, that is the time interval of the relation they participate in.</p>
<p>As in the N-ary model so also in the 4-D fluents approach the domain and the range of the property  <em>denotes</em>  change, both represented by the  <em>TimeSlice</em>  class. So, this model as well suffers from some limitations in OWL reasoning capabilities. With respect to the N-ary model, the 4-D fluents approach is affected by a wider proliferation of entities (compare the blue objects in Figure 2).</p>

<p>So far, the main mechanisms for representing time evolving information were illustrated. In the next two subsections, we present a vocabulary to represent time-related facts, i.e. OWL-Time, and a set of rules, i.e. SWRL, which operate on temporal relations to infer new temporal knowledge and to detect inconsistent assertions.</p>
<h2 id="41-owl-time-and-allens-relations">4.1 OWL-Time and Allen’s Relations</h2>
<p>OWL-Time<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  is an ontology of temporal concepts, conceived to describe the temporal properties of resources. It provides a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological relations among instants and intervals, together with information about durations and date-time. Figure 4(a) illustrates a diagram of OWL-Time ontology. The properties  <em>hasTemporalDuration</em> ,  <em>hasBeginning</em> ,  <em>hasEnd</em> , and  <em>hasTime</em>  provide a standard way to attach time information to ontological entities.</p>
<p>Let us consider, for example, that the term ti denotes the concept cj from 1898 to 1903. In this case all the needed temporal facts can be specified using OWL-Time vocabulary.</p>
<p>However, if we wanted to answer questions like  “What are the intervals overlapping the interval 1898-1903?” , or  “what are the relations holding in that interval?” , OWL-Time vocabulary would not be enough. James F. Allen (<a href="#allen1983">1983</a>) provided then a calculus for temporal reasoning, by introducing thirteen base relations capturing the possible relations between two intervals (see Figure 4(b)). They allow the computation of any relative position or sequence. In the context of the Semantic Web, these rules can be represented by means of the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), described in the following section. The use of this language makes it possible to assert new instances of relationships between the ontology entities.</p>

<h2 id="42-semantic-web-rule-language">4.2 Semantic Web Rule Language</h2>
<p>Semantic Web Rule Language<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  (SWRL) is a language based on a subset of Datalog with both unary and binary predicates, representing the rule layer within the Semantic Web stack. The form of these rules is an implication between an antecedent (body) and a consequent (head), each consisting of zero or a conjunction of more atoms.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  Whenever the conditions specified in the antecedent hold, then the conditions specified in the consequent must hold as well. Atoms can be of the form C(x), P(x,y), sameAs(x,y), differentFrom(x,y), or builtIn(r,x,&hellip;) where C is an OWL description or data range, P is an OWL property, r is a built-in relation, x and y are either variables or OWL individuals or OWL data values, as appropriate. For example, the following SWRL rule infers if an instant i1 is before an instant i2, by verifying a set of premises:</p>
<p>Instant(?i1) ∧ Instant(?i2) ∧ inXSDDateTime(?i1, ?y) ∧ inXSDDateTime(?i2, ?w) ∧ swrl:lessThan(?y, ?w) → before(?i2, ?i1)</p>
<p>where the built-in swrl:lessThan(?y, ?w) is satisfied when the date represented by the variable ?y is earlier than that represented by ?w.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  In this case, when temporal information is provided as a date, the qualitative relations are specified using SWRL rules that apply on the quantitative representation. The rules can be applied to qualitative temporal information as well. In the following, a rule about the relation  <em>during</em>  is provided:</p>
<p>ProperInterval(?a) ∧ ProperInterval(?x) ∧ before(?b, ?y) ∧ before(?z, ?c) ∧ hasBeginning(?a, ?b) ∧ hasBeginning(?x, ?y) ∧ hasEnd(?a, ?c) ∧ hasEnd(?x, ?z) → During(?x, ?a)</p>
<h2 id="5-adding-time-to-terminologies">5. Adding Time to Terminologies</h2>
<p>Given the different approaches to modelling time described in the previous section, we chose to adopt the N-ary model.</p>
<p>The reason for this choice is twofold. First of all, the N-ary relations approach is supported by the Ontology Engineering and Patterns Task Force of the Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  Secondly, with respect to the perdurantist approach, the N-ary model requires the introduction of a smaller number of objects and thus  “outperforms the 4D-fluents representation in terms of required assertions (axioms) and consequently in reasoning time”   <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In order to formalize terminology evolution following the N-ary approach, we took inspiration from the model introduced by Preventis et al. (2014)<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  to handle temporal ontologies in OWL. In particular, we introduced the following entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>the class  <em>Event</em> , which represents the reification of a property holding in a certain time. To model the class  <em>Event</em>  we used the relative type  <em>dcmitype:Event</em>  taken from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and defined as a  “non-persistent, time-based occurrence” <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> ;</li>
<li>the object property  <em>during</em> , having the class  <em>dcmitype:Event</em>  as domain and the class  <em>time:ProperInterval</em>  of the OWL-Time ontology as range. The latter is defined as  “a temporal entity with non-zero extent or duration, i.e. for which the value of the beginning and end are different” .<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>    <em>during</em>  has been modelled as a sub-property of  <em>dcterms:date</em>  (described as a  “point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource” ) of the DCMI vocabulary<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> ;</li>
<li>the object property  <em>temporalProperty</em> , which relates individuals of the class  <em>dcmitype:Event</em>  respectively to the source and to the target individuals of the original property which has been reified. As we will see in detail shortly, the object properties that are converted into temporal ones are formalised as sub-properties of  <em>temporalProperty</em> .</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the N-ary approach outlined above, the terminological layer of our model was formalised by extending the  <em>lemon</em>  model. The model does not contain a complete collection of linguistic categories; consequently, it builds on Lexinfo ontology<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  in order to provide a vocabulary to describe the properties of linguistic objects. More specifically, the four lexico-semantic relationships defined in Lexinfo, namely synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  were  “temporalised”  ( <em>temporalSynonym</em> ,  <em>temporalAntonym</em> ,  <em>temporalHypernym</em> , and  <em>temporalHyponym</em> ) and thus converted into sub-properties of  <em>temporalProperty</em>  to indicate their involvement in a temporal event. The same was done for the properties  <em>ontolex:reference</em> , which links every individual of the  <em>ontolex:LexicalSense</em>  class to a concept defined in an ontology, and  <em>ontolex:sense</em> , linking an individual of the class  _ontolex:LexicalEntry _ to a specific sense.</p>
<p>In addition, each of these relations was reified and converted into subclasses of the class  <em>dcmitype:Event</em> :  <em>senseEvent</em>  representing the reification of sense relation,  <em>referenceEvent</em>  representing the reification of the relation linking a sense and an ontology concept,  <em>equivalentEvent</em> ,  <em>incompatibleEvent</em> ,  <em>broaderEvent</em> ,  <em>narrowerEvent</em>  representing respectively the reification of synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy relations holding between two senses.</p>
<p>The class  <em>dcmitype:Event</em>  as well as its subclasses mentioned above are related to the class  <em>time:ProperInterval</em>  through the object property  <em>during</em> .</p>
<p>So, for example, in order to represent the temporal synonymy (Figure 5), the class  <em>equivalentEvent</em>  is related to the class  <em>time:ProperInterval</em>  through the relation  <em>temporalSynonym</em> , specifying the time period in which the relation of synonymy holds between two senses.</p>
<p>As we can see, the introduction of an intermediate object, namely the individual of the class  <em>equivalentEvent</em> , splits the static relation linking a subject and an object into two parts. Instead of a single triple linking two senses ( _s 1 _  sense  _s 2 _ ), two triples are created, in which the individual of the class  <em>equivalentEvent</em>  appears as subject in one case and as object in the other.</p>

<p>However, this is not enough. As we underlined above, to define in which period a term is used with a certain sense and to denote a specific concept, scholars need to resort to textual sources.</p>
<p>As a result, our model is based on the key concept of attestation; more specifically, the senses of a term are linked to the text where they are attested, and for each text the writing time is defined by means of specific relations. To represent texts and attestations, as the main entities constituting the textual layer of our model, we introduced the following entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>the class  <em>Text</em> , which represents every work produced in a written form. As many methodological and theoretical works have underlined over the years, the notion of text is highly complex and culturally rich and, thus, difficult to define and formalize. A detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this article. The term  “text”  is to be understood here in a broad sense, including entities that are very different from each other, such as books, published articles, handwritten notes, drafts of unfinished works etc. It can be considered equivalent to the type  “ Text ”  as defined in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Type Vocabulary ( <em>dcmitype:Text</em> ), namely a  “resource whose content is primarily words for reading” .<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  If scholars need to use vocabularies providing more subtle distinctions, many models for representing documents in Linked Data have been already proposed, offering an opportunity for high quality bibliographic data to be exposed to the Semantic Web, such as FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> or Bibframe (Bibliographic Framework) <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. Importantly enough, if a different vocabulary is adopted, the validity of our model is not compromised;</li>
<li>the object property  <em>hasAttestation</em> , which relates a sense, instance of the class  <em>ontolex:LexicalSense</em> , to an instance of the class  <em>dcmitype:Text</em> ; a few works about the modeling of the attestation of a term in a document have been already done <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>; for the sake of reuse of existing vocabularies we adopted the  <em>hasAttestation</em>  property defined by the LAWD (Linked Ancient World Data) ontology<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> ;</li>
<li>the object property  <em>hasWritingTime</em> , defined as a subproperty of  <em>dcterms:date</em> , which relates an individual of the class  <em>dcmitype:Text</em>  to an individual belonging to the class  <em>time:ProperInterval</em>  of the OWL-Time ontology.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is up to the scholar to define the boundaries of the writing interval, which can be qualitative or quantitative. In fact, only in rare cases he/she can define with certainty the extent of the period in which an author has worked on drafting a text, with the aid of internal elements or external sources (for example, the author explicitly declares that he/she has written that work in a certain period, etc.).</p>
<p>In most cases, on the contrary, temporal information on the writing process is vague and ambiguous and partially bounded intervals ( “before X” ,  “after Y” , etc.) need to be defined. Instead of specifying the exact duration or the starting and ending points in time, scholars describe intervals with respect to their mutual relations, by establishing the terminus post quem or the terminus ante quem, namely the limits of the possible range of dates in which a work has been written.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup></p>
<p>As for published texts, instead of the  <em>hasWritingTime</em>  property, the  <em>dcterms:issued</em> <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>  can be used, with the year of publication constituting the end of the drafting period.</p>
<p>An overview of the model is illustrated in Figure 6.</p>

        <p>Overview of the proposed model. (a) the textual layer is constituted by texts and attestation. (b) the terminological layer relies on a N-ary version of <em>lemon</em> , where each reified class is an event having a temporal extent. (c) the ontological layer concerns the formal definitions of the concepts denoted by the terms and it is described with OWL.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To take maximum advantage of the adoption of OWL as the representation language of the resource, we have also conceived a set of SWRL rules to automatize the attribution of some temporal information.</p>
<p>The following rule states that, if a sense is attested in a text written in a certain time interval, then that sense  “exists”  during the same interval.</p>
<p>Text(?t) ^ time:ProperInterval(?i) ^ hasWritingTime(?t, ?i) ^ ontolex:LexicalEntry(?l) ^ ontolex:LexicalSense(?s) ^ isAttestedIn(?s, ?t) ^ ontolex:sense(?l, ?s) ^ swrlx:createOWLThing(?se, ?s) ⇾ senseEvent(?se) ^ temporalSense(?l, ?se) ^ temporalSense(?se, ?s) ^ during(?se, ?i)</p>
<p>More specifically, given a text  <em>t</em>  written in a time interval  <em>i</em>  (defined as an instance of  <em>time:ProperInterval</em> ), and given a lexical entry  <em>l</em>  with a lexical sense  <em>s</em>  (these two related to each other through the synchronic  <em>ontolex:sense</em>  relation) attested in text  <em>t</em> , then  <em>l</em>  has sense  <em>s</em>  (in a diachronic perspective) during the interval  <em>i</em> . The premise of the rule is composed of the following steps: i) an anonymous individual  <em>se</em>  is created  <em>ex novo</em>  in the antecedent part of the rule using the  <em>createOWLThing</em>  built-in relation<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup> ; ii)  <em>se</em>  is defined, in the consequent part, as an event representing the reified relation (in particular by instantiating it as a member of the class  <em>senseEvent</em> ); iii) the property  <em>temporalSense</em>  is used to relate the lexical entry  <em>l</em>  to  <em>se</em>  and, in turn, to relate  <em>se</em>  to sense  <em>s</em> ; iv) finally, the event  <em>se</em>  is defined as happening in the same time interval  <em>i</em>  during which the text has been written.</p>
<p>If the sense of a lexical entry is attested in more than one text (each one written in a specific temporal interval), the rule will be fired for each text, thus relating the lexical entry to that sense in a more complex period constituted of multiple time intervals.</p>
<p>Similarly, the temporal validity of the  <em>ontolex:reference</em>  relation, linking each  <em>ontolex:LexicalSense</em>  to one and only one concept of an ontology, can be inferred from the writing time of the text as well, using the following SWRL rule:</p>
<p>Text(?t) ^ time:ProperInterval(?i) ^ hasWritingTime(?t, ?int) ^ ontolex:LexicalSense(?s) ^ isAttestedIn(?s, ?t) ^ Concept(?c) ^ ontolex:reference(?s, ?c) ^ swrlx:createOWLThing(?re, ?c) ⇾ referenceEvent(?re) ^ temporalReference(?s, ?re) ^ temporalReference(?re, ?c) ^ during(?re, ?i)</p>
<p>If a sense  <em>s</em>  is linked to a concept  <em>c</em>  through the (synchronic)  <em>ontolex:reference</em>  property, and if  <em>s</em>  is attested in a specific text  <em>t</em>  written in the time interval  <em>i</em> , then, in a diachronic perspective, the relation reference holds in the same time interval  <em>i</em>  as well. In other words, the fact that a word is used with a particular sense in a specific text is equivalent to saying that in that period that term was used to express that specific concept.</p>
<p>Figures 7 and 8 show respectively how the temporal versions of ontolex relations  <em>ontolex:sense</em>  and  <em>ontolex:reference</em>  can be automatically inferred by a reasoner and represented in our N-ary model starting from the writing time of texts.</p>

<p>We are also working at defining other rules taking into account the relations of synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, and hyponymy, with the aim of automatizing the creation of their diachronic counterparts, with the addition of Allen’s relations described in Section 4.1.</p>
<h2 id="6-the-construction-of-a-diachronic-resource-the-saussure-case-study">6. The Construction of a Diachronic Resource: the Saussure Case Study</h2>
<p>Ferdinand de Saussure (Geneva, 1857-1913), the father of general linguistics, never published his theories on general linguistics and semiotics in an organic work. He strove to structure the flow of his thoughts and ideas in handwritten notes, which are often characterized by a synthetic, fragmentary and hermetic nature. These manuscripts display an obsessive and constant search for clear, effective and unambiguous terms, against the  “ineptie de la terminologie courante”  (Letter to Meillet written in 1984, see <a href="#benveniste1964">Benveniste 1964</a>). He changed the meaning to some terms over time, assigned additional specific meanings to already existing terms, used some expressions ephemerally, and even forged new words. This terminological fluctuation reflects the difficulties underlying every process of theoretical creation and sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics through which concepts take shape and cut through language to finally find their linguistic expression. This process of rumination  <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> is typical when dealing with theoretical terminologies as in the case of Saussure, who tries to revolutionize the current linguistic vision and to lay the foundations of linguistics as a science.</p>
<p>Saussure’s terminology has been the subject of numerous studies <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. In 2011 the first electronic thesaurus of Saussure&rsquo;s terminology, named  <em>Simple_FdS</em>   <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>, was built as part of the project  “Per una edizione digitale dei manoscritti di F. de Saussure” , coordinated by then President of the Cercle Ferdinand de Saussure Daniele Gambarara.</p>
<p>The architecture of  <em>Simple_FdS</em>  was based on the lexical model SIMPLE <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup> and was therefore inspired by the Generative Lexicon theory elaborated by Pustejovsky (<a href="#pustejovsky1995">1995</a>). The Generative Lexicon theory, mainly applied to general language, has proved to be very effective in the description of specialized language and terminological lexicons as well (for example <a href="#arauz2012">Aráuz et al. 2012</a>, <a href="#sanchezibanez2014">Sánchez Ibáñez and García Palacios 2014</a>), as it makes it possible to enrich the range of conceptual relations which is traditionally based on generic-specific and part-whole relations.</p>
<p>Initially, the electronic lexicon was conceived as static and no diachronic aspects were taken into account. Recently, as we shall illustrate in Section 6.1, the model here proposed has been adopted to convert this terminological resource from a static repository into a dynamic one.</p>
<p>As underlined in Section 2, in diachronic terminology the textual dimension plays a crucial role. Consequently, the first step was to build a good corpus, able to represent the diachronic evolution we want to study. The texts included in Saussure’s corpus can be considered as highly representative of diachronic evolution of Saussure’s terminology, embracing all the thirty-seven years in which the intellectual activity of the Genevan linguist unfolded. The period covered by the corpus ranges from 1874 - when Saussure wrote his first  <em>Essai pour réduire les mots du grec, du latin &amp; de l&rsquo;allemand à un petit nombre de racines</em>  - until 1911, the year in which he took the third course of general linguistics, the last academic teaching held before his death, which occurred in 1913 after a long illness.</p>
<p>Let us see in detail an example of the formalisation of the terminological changes occurring in Saussure&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<h2 id="61-temporalizing-saussures-terminology-the-case-of-signe">6.1 Temporalizing Saussure&rsquo;s Terminology: the Case of Signe</h2>
<p>As is well known, Saussure&rsquo;s theories have been particularly influential in semiotic studies. He emphasized first the dyadic and complex nature of linguistic sign, which consists of two heterogeneous entities: a signifier (signifiant), namely the hearer’s psychological impression of a sound, and a signified (signifié), i.e. a concept, an abstract idea. This terminology - still in use today - was introduced by the Genevan linguist at the end of his life, after a long theoretical reflection emerging in many of his handwritten pages.</p>
<p>Here, as an example, the concept of SIGNIFIER was chosen and the formal representation of the different terms Saussure used over time to designate this concept is illustrated, in accordance with the N-ary model we propose here. In the following, the relationships and the classes taken from existing standard vocabularies will be indicated with prefixes of the respective vocabularies.</p>
<p>The concept of SIGNIFIER is denoted by many different terms in Saussurean manuscripts, such as signe, image acoustique, image verbale, image vocale, image auditive, son, forme. More specifically, the term signe is attested intermittently from 1891 to 1911 in many works, such as  <em>De la double essence du langage, Status et Motus, Notes Item, Troisième Cours de linguistique générale</em>  etc. To formally represent this, the instance  <em>signe_sense</em> , belonging to the  <em>ontolex:LexicalSense</em>  class, was created and linked - by means of the relation  <em>isAttestedIn</em>  - to the instances of the class  <em>dcmitype:Text</em>  representing all the works where the term occurs. The writing period of each text was formally defined. Here the case of  <em>Double Essence du language</em>  is shown. The instance  <em>Double_Essence_Writing_Time</em>  of the class  <em>time:ProperInterval</em>  (subclass of  <em>time:Interval</em> ) was created and linked to the instance  <em>Double_Essence</em>  through the relation  <em>hasWritingTime</em> . The writing interval of this work, which is supposed to range from 1891 to 1892,<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>  was formally defined by linking the instance  <em>Double_Essence_Writing_Time</em>  through the relation  <em>time:hasBeginning</em>  to an instance of the class  <em>time:Instant</em> , defined by the Data Property  <em>XSDDateTime</em>  with value  “1891-01-01T00:00:00”  as well as through the relation  <em>time:hasEnd</em>  to an instance of the class  <em>time:Instant</em> , defined by the Data Property  <em>XSDDateTime</em>  with value  “1892-12-31T00:00:00” . The same formalisation was performed for each work where this sense of  <em>signe</em>  was attested.</p>
<p>As described in Section 5, on the basis of the N-ary approach here adopted, ontolex relations were reified and the following classes were introduced as subclass of  <em>dcmitype:Event</em> :  <em>broaderEvent</em>  (reification of the hypernym relation);  <em>narrowerEvent</em>  (reification of the hyponym relation);  <em>incompatibleEvent</em>  (reification of the antonymy relation);  <em>equivalentEvent</em>  (reification of the synonymy relation),  <em>referenceEvent</em>  (reification of the inter-level relation  <em>reference</em> ) and finally  <em>senseEvent</em>  (reification of the relation linking a lexical entry to its senses).</p>
<p>By firing the two rules illustrated in Section 5, the classes  <em>referenceEvent</em>  and  <em>senseEvent</em>  were automatically populated. More specifically, in accordance with the first rule, the instance  <em>signe_sense_ts</em>  was created and linked by means of the relation  <em>temporalSense</em>  both to  <em>signe_sense</em>  (individual of the  <em>ontolex:LexicalSense</em>  class) and to  <em>signe_entry</em>  (individual of the  <em>ontolex:LexicalEntry</em>  class). Similarly, by firing the second rule, the individual  <em>signe_sense_ref_signifiant_concept</em>  was created and linked by the relation  <em>temporalReference</em>  both to  <em>signe_sense</em>  and to an ontology concept, described in the  <em>Simple_FdS</em>  ontology.</p>
<p>As underlined above, a terminological fluctuation can be observed in Saussure&rsquo;s work as regard to the designation of the concept SIGNIFIER.</p>
<p>An attempt to completely renew semiotic terminology is attested in the so-called  <em>Notes Items</em> . In these handwritten pages, defined by Stetter (<a href="#stetter1979">1979</a>) as a  “fragment sémiologique central” , Saussure’s reflection upon linguistic sign achieved extraordinary theoretical heights. Many heterodox neologisms were introduced, such as sème, sème linguistique, aposème, kenôme, sôme, contre-sôme etc. Here the  “material”  part of linguistic sign, namely the  “signifier” , is denoted in certain passages by the term aposème. This terminology is abandoned later and the term signe continues to be used to indicate at the same time the  “material”  part of the linguistic sign and the whole, namely the combination of SIGNIFIED (concept) and SIGNIFIER (acoustic image). In order to avoid the confusion that the polysemy of the term signe generated in his students, Saussure introduced in extremis the term signifiant, during his last course on general linguistics in 1911. He proposed thus to retain the word signe to designate the linguistic entity as a whole, and to replace the dyad  <em>signe</em>  and  <em>concept</em>  respectively by signifiant and signifié.</p>
<p>To formalise this terminological fluctuation, the instance  <em>signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense</em>  of the  <em>equivalentEvent</em>  class was created and the static triple ( <em>signe_sense</em>    <em>lexinfo:synonymy aposème_sense</em> ) was split into the following two triples in accordance with the N-ary model: ( <em>signe temporalSynonym signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense</em> ) and ( <em>signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense temporalSynonym aposème</em> ). The instance  <em>signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense</em>  was then linked to the interval  <em>Notes_Item_Writing_Interval</em>  by means of the relation  <em>during</em> .</p>
<p>In a similar way, the instance  <em>signe_sense_syn_signifiant_sense</em>  of the  <em>equivalentEvent</em>  class was created and linked via  <em>temporalSynonym</em>  to the individual  <em>signifiant</em> . The instance  <em>signe</em>  was in turn linked - by means of the same relation - to the instance  <em>signe_sense_syn_signifiant_sense</em> , belonging to the reified class  <em>equivalentEvent</em> . Finally, the instance was linked to the interval  <em>troisième_Cours_Interval</em>  (with beginning 1910 and end 1911) by means of the relation  <em>during</em> .</p>
<h2 id="62-querying-saussures-diachronic-terminology">6.2 Querying Saussure&rsquo;s Diachronic Terminology</h2>
<p>Such a formalization, even if complex and redundant, makes it possible to reconstruct on a timeline the evolution of the lexical-semantic relationships between senses as well as the relations holding between senses and concepts, and then to answer complex and sophisticated queries. Here are just a few of the many queries which can be performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which are the terms used over time to denote a concept  <em>c</em> ?</li>
<li>Which are the terms attested in a specific time interval  <em>i</em>  and used to denote a concept  <em>c</em> ?</li>
<li>Which are the terms attested in a specific time interval  <em>i</em>  which are synonym (antonym or hypernym or hyponym) of the term  <em>t</em> ?</li>
<li>Which are the terms synonyms of the term  <em>t</em>  in a specific text  <em>T</em> ?</li>
<li>Which are the concepts denoted by the term  <em>t</em>  over time?</li>
<li>Which are the concepts denoted by the term  <em>t</em>  in a specific time interval  <em>i</em> ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Returning to our Saussure’s case study, let us suppose, for example, that scholars would like to know which terms have been used by the Genevan linguist over time as synonyms of the term signe (in the sense of signe linguistique, namely  “l’union de l’idée avec ce produit phonatoire” ).</p>
<p>The query results are represented here in the form of a graph (Figure 9), as they appear in LexO, a collaborative web editor of lexical and termino-ontological resources, developed by the Institute of Computational Linguistics of the Italian National Research Council (ILC-CNR) and already used within several research projects, such as DiTMAO <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup> and Totus Mundus <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup></p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As clearly appears in the graph, the formalization previously described makes it emerge immediately Saussure’s unceasing and obsessive work in search for the term that best represented the concept.</p>
<p>In an initial period, spanning approximately from 1891 and 1892, Saussure introduces three interesting neologisms: signe-idée, son-idée and forme-sens. These three nominal compounds well reflect the fact that the linguistic sign is composed of two parts that are closely connected as the two sides of a piece of paper. In effect, the bipartite structure of the terms mirrors the dyadic nature of the linguistic sign. Each element of the compound denotes one of the two parts composing the linguistic sign. More specifically, the first constituent of the compound refers to the signifier, i.e. the sound-image (signe, son, forme), while the second element denotes the conceptual side, the idea conveyed by the sign (idée, sens).</p>
<p>Later, in a time span ranging from 1899 to 1903, Saussure renames signe as sème and distinguishes it from its  “material”  constituent, named aposème or sôme and from its conceptual part, designated as parasôme or contre- sôme, thus introducing a constellation of neologisms derived from ancient Greek, as is usual in scientific terminology. All these neologisms are abandoned and no longer adopted by the Genevan linguist who prefers to continue using more traditional terms such as mot, terme, signe linguistique. These terms are all attested in the third course of general linguistics held by Saussure in Geneva between 1910 and 1911. Here Saussure definitely chooses the term signe to indicate the whole resulting from the association of form, named signifiant, and meaning, named signifié, thus resolving the ambiguity that until then had characterized the term signe:  “L&rsquo;ambiguïté disparaîtrait si l&rsquo;on désignait les trois notions ici en présence par des noms qui s&rsquo;appellent les uns les autres tout en s&rsquo;opposant. Nous proposons de conserver le mot signe pour désigner le total, et de remplacer concept et image acoustique respectivement par signifié et signifiant; ces derniers termes ont l’avantage de marquer l’opposition qui les sépare soit entre eux, soit du total dont ils font partie. [&hellip;]”   <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Another query focussing on the period of attestation of the term signe in all its meanings brings out this ambiguity more clearly, as illustrated in Figure 10.</p>

<p>The green bar represents the period in which every sense is attested; clicking on it in LexO interface the complete list of all the works where the term occurs is provided.</p>
<p>As the graph shows,  <em>signe</em>  is used in the same period - and in the same texts - with two different meanings, namely to indicate the most  “concrete”  part of the linguistic sign (signe sense-2) as well as to denote the union of a concept and a form (signe sense-3).<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>  This polysemy generates ambiguity, and – as we know – ambiguity should be strongly avoided in terminology where, according to GTT, the term must be monosemic and the concept unambiguous. Saussure is aware of this and therefore during his last course on general linguistics – and more precisely on May 19 1911 – proposes to preserve the term signe in its third sense and to replace it with the neologism signifiant as for the second meaning.</p>
<p>As Saussure’s case study demonstrates, models and tools devoted to representing and querying diachronic terminological resources play a crucial role in order to better understand the terminological fluctuation and the mobile and progressive conceptualisation which characterize some unstable phases of science.</p>
<h2 id="7-conclusion-and-next-steps">7. Conclusion and Next Steps</h2>
<p>Representing the diachronic evolution of terminological and conceptual data in a formal way constitutes a challenge, since standard formalisms adopted in the Semantic Web for the representation of data have mainly been conceived for static and monotonic information.</p>
<p>In this work we have proposed a Semantic Web-based model for representing in an explicit and formal way the diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a given domain, accompanied by a concrete use case focussing on the evolution of linguistic terminology as attested in Ferdinand De Saussure’s writings. The temporalization approach illustrated here is domain independent and can be virtually applied to any RDF data model. The main drawback is that such an approach requires a significant design effort in modelling and encoding specific sets of temporal rules. In addition, the properties to be temporalized need to be already known at the modelling time. However, in slightly  “controlled”  domains like terminology and lexicography, our approach turns out to be effective to describe the historical development of a language, and its many temporal variations.</p>
<p>The next research objectives are: i) the enrichment of the model, ii) the exploitation of the resource, iii) the extension of the tool LexO to support the construction of diachronic resources <sup id="fnref1:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup></p>
<p>As far as the enrichment of the model is concerned, we plan to design new SWRL rules for the automatic temporalization of lexico-semantic properties holding between senses, such as synonymy, antonymy etc.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to manage the cases when the writing period of a text is uncertain, we intend to develop an algorithm exploiting the resource for automatic dating suggestion: the behaviour of terms in those texts, whose writing time is known, will be used to advance hypotheses on the uncertain (or even unknown) writing time periods of the other texts belonging to the corpus under analysis. Needless to say, the accuracy of suggested time periods will be proportionate to the amount of (certain) temporal information already encoded in the diachronic resource.</p>
<p>Finally, we are working to extend the tool LexO as to include the management of texts and temporal information. The tool will be designed to relieve scholars from the time consuming (and prone to errors) task of formalising the large amount of entities required to represent the temporal information according to the N-ary model. In addition, thanks to LexO scholars will not be required to manage the formalisms and the languages underlying the Web Semantic technologies such as RDF and OWL.</p>
<p>The first extension of the tool LexO aimed at the inclusion of temporal information will involve the integration of functions for the management of text. As discussed in Section 2, diachronic terminology is a textual terminology, and terms have to be analysed in their contexts of use. For this reason, LexO will be equipped with a module through which users will be able to import their documents and the relative time information (writing time, date of publishing, etc.), organize them into folders, browse them and link each encoded term to the relative attestations in the corpus.</p>

<p>For the time being, LexO supports the uploading of diachronic resources, which are built according to the N-ary model, and offers a  <em>Question Answering</em>  system, implemented as a user-friendly interface composed of several controlled natural language templates. Each template makes it possible to formulate a query in controlled natural language thanks to dropdown menus. For further extensions of the tool LexO, see Section 7.&#160;<a href="#fnref:71" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
