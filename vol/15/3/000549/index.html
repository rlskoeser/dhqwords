Everything is subjected to the inexorable law of change: the reality, the categories through which we organize it and the words we use to talk about it.</p><p>This is particularly the case for the history of science. Over the centuries, scholars have built different theoretical models in response to the continuous innovation that emerged from observation sometimes producing a real scientific revolution in the worldview. Needless to say, a change in conceptual level often corresponds to a change in terminology<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> : new terms can be introduced to express the new system of concepts or old terms can be dismissed when the concept becomes obsolete. The aim of this article is to present a model for formally representing the diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a given domain, so that this formalization can be machine-actionable. Taking advantage from past experiences conducted in the context of several projects<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> , we propose here an approach based on Semantic Web technologies that guarantees interoperability and reuse of diachronic terminological resources across scientific communities.</p><p>The development of standards for representing and exchanging data has always been a concern in the terminological field. Interoperability across terminological formats is basically ensured by adopting the ISO standard 30042: 2008 TBX (TermBase eXchange), an XML-based family of terminology exchange formats compliant with the Terminological Markup Framework (TMF - ISO 16642: 2003).</p><p>Over the last few years, interesting solutions for interoperability have been offered by the Semantic Web technologies and the Linked Open Data initiative which allow data to be shared, reused across applications and linked with the resources available on the Web, thus benefiting from the whole datacloud of URIs with which reference resources like DBpedia are already networked.</p><p>In terminology, there has been a growing trend towards representing and publishing terminological resources on the Semantic Web according to Linked Open Data principles, as demonstrated for example by the NCBO (National Center for Biomedical Ontology) BioPortal, a repository of more than 300 biomedical ontologies and terminologies converted into RDF<a class=footnote-ref href=#salvadores2013> [salvadores2013] </a>; or by the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium<a class=footnote-ref href=#smith2007> [smith2007] </a>aiming to create a family of new or extant ontologies based on shared principles compliant with the Semantic Web technologies. These and other similar initiatives are all driven by the same need, namely to avoid that terminologies, created by proprietary software, exist independently of each other, hidden in isolated databases. The lack of semantic interoperability, indeed, precludes any possibility of progress, as medical data can be exploited to their full potential only if they are interconnected to each other. Sharing large quantities of data structured in ontologies makes it possible to use IT applications and artificial intelligence systems, enabling thus better diagnostics, early disease prevention and, more generally, a deeper understanding of the human biology and health.</p><p>Another initiative deserving to be mentioned is the EuroVoc management based on technologies in line with W3C recommendations and with the latest developments in classification standards. A collaborative project started in 2019 and undertaken by the Publications Office of the European Union and the International Labour Office<a class=footnote-ref href=#dechandon2019> [dechandon2019] </a>aims to align EuroVoc with other controlled vocabularies and publish them as Linked Open Data. The objective is to improve data accessibility and guarantee large-scale interoperability, thus facilitating the authoring-translating-publishing chain as well as the work in public administrations and international organisations.</p><p>Finally, Cimiano et al. (<a href=#cimiano2015>2015</a>) proposed an approach to convert terminological datasets originally stored in TBX format to RDF by means of an online service named TBX2RDF, allowing thereby terminological resources to be used and enhanced across different scientific communities and, in particular, to become part of the great Linguistic Linked (Open) Data cloud (seeinfra).</p><p>Nevertheless, as we shall see, using these technologies to represent the diachronic evolution of terminological and conceptual data constitutes an interesting challenge, since OWL (Web Ontology Language), the W3C standard language developed to represent ontologies in the Semantic Web, is fundamentally static and monotonic.</p><h2 id=2-terminology-and-diachrony>2. Terminology and Diachrony</h2><p>In the terminological literature, the diachronic dimension has been neglected for a long time. This was mainly due to the onomasiological, prescriptive and static approach underlying the General Theory of Terminology (GTT) elaborated by Wüster in 1968.</p><p>Wüster’s approach to terminology was based on a neo-positivist referential and taxonomic semiotics<a class=footnote-ref href=#slodzian2000> [slodzian2000] </a>, according to which concepts take precedence over words. In GTT terms are monosemic and concepts are monoreferential; a perfect correspondence is established between them: each concept corresponds to one and only one term. The term is thus equivalent to a symbol, to a “désignateur rigide” <a class=footnote-ref href=#kripke1995>[kripke1995] </a>, since it works in much the same way as the system of proper names works in general language. Conceptual structures, on the other hand, are regarded as universal and static like their referents and any diachronic dimension is neutralised.</p><p>In outlining the theoretical and methodological differences between lexicology and terminology, Cabré (<a href=#cabre1999>1999: 8</a>) emphasized that terminology is only concerned with synchronic aspects:</p><blockquote><p>This view, which today is considered the most systematic, coherent theoretical approach to terms, differs from lexicological theory in three ways: in the priority of the concept over the designation; in being exclusively concerned with the level of the terminological unit and not with the other levels of linguistic description; in excluding any diachronic approach of information.</p></blockquote><p>Terminology began to open up to diachrony timidly after the “odyssée terminotique” <a class=footnote-ref href=#slodzian2000>[slodzian2000] </a>of the 80s, when an impressive number of term banks, based on the synchronic traditional vision of the Viennese school, were produced and spread (EURODICAUTOM, NORMATERM, UNITERM, TERMIUM, IATE etc.). In 1988 a symposium entitled “Terminologie diachronique” was organized by the <em>Centre de Terminologie</em> of Bruxelles, but ten years after Møller (1998) still regretted a “quantitative and / or qualitative deficit” in that branch of terminology for which he coined the neologism “terminochronie” . Over the last twenty years several studies have been conducted focussing on the evolution of concepts and terms in specialized languages (see inter al.<a href=#vancampenhoudt1997>van Campenhoudt 1997</a>,<a href=#dury2008>Dury 2008</a>,<a href=#zanola2014>Zanola 2014</a>,<a href=#kristiansen2014>Kristiansen 2014</a>), as well as on methods for compiling diachronic corpora<a class=footnote-ref href=#dury2004> [dury2004] </a>and identifying the evolution of knowledge in corpora<a class=footnote-ref href=#picton2009> [picton2009] </a>.</p><p>As underlined by Dury and Picton (<a href=#dury2009>2009</a>), this lack of interest for diachronic aspects in terminology was mainly due to technical, pragmatic, psychological, and most of all theoretical and historical obstacles. Diachronic terminology is, indeed, by definition a textual terminology<a class=footnote-ref href=#bourigault1999> [bourigault1999] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#pearson1998>[pearson1998] </a>, a terminology of “discourse” . Terms must be analysed in their real context of use and must not be seen as abstract and static labels associated with concepts. They should be rather regarded as linguistic signs, which enter into a dynamic relationship both with the concepts and with the other linguistic signs that constitute the terminological system. In a diachronic perspective, terminological work is fundamentally semasiological and descriptive. In order to grasp terminological variation over time, the starting point is the sense that a term acquires within a real linguistic context and the focus is on language as it is actually used (Ist-Norm) in real specialised (con-)texts and not on language as it should be used (Soll-Norm). To use Bourigault and Slodzian words (<a href=#bourigault1999>1999: 31</a>), “le texte est le point de départ de la description lexicale à construire. On va du texte vers le terme” .</p><p>Texts are usually the unique source that the scholars have at their disposal in order to access disappeared states of languages and more completely understand the history of terms and their evolution over time. Texts play a crucial role to establish when and how words acquire (terminologization) and lose (determinologization) their terminological status, or how a term passes from one specialized field to another or from the intimate pages of a scholar to the entire scientific community.</p><p>Regarding this last aspect, in particular, texts constitute a precious means to record the typical terminological fluctuation that precedes or follows the formation of the so-called “normal science” state. As a matter of fact, in a phase of “normal science” , when the development of knowledge is adherent to what Kuhn (<a href=#kuhn1970>1970</a>) calls “paradigm” , the system of terms is standard, explicitly defined and consensually used within a scientific community. In revolutionary phases, on the contrary, when a revision of existing scientific beliefs or practices is involved, terminology can be characterized by great instability. Texts become thus a conceptual and terminological space of creativity, where scholars think, reflect and give a linguistic form to their ideas. In these cases, ephemeral lexical formations are often attested only in the idiolect of the one who forged them without ever taking root within the scientific community.</p><p>An example of this phenomenon will be illustrated in Section 6 with Ferdinand de Saussure’s terminology.</p><h2 id=3-modelling-an-interoperable-terminological-resource>3. Modelling an Interoperable Terminological Resource</h2><p>When modelling a digital scholarly resource, the key point is to choose a model capable of maximizing its usefulness in the community of reference. According to the “FAIR guidelines” , scholarly data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable<a class=footnote-ref href=#wilkinson2016> [wilkinson2016] </a>. First of all, for data to be findable, they must be referred to using a globally unique and persistent identifier and must also be indexed in a searchable resource. Furthermore, data must be accessible through a standardized protocol and, at the same time, has to be interoperable in virtue of its representation in a formal and shared knowledge representation language. Finally, to be reusable, data must be “described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes” (<a href=#wilkinson2016>ibidem: 4</a>).</p><p>In order to pursue the FAIR policies and to build fair diachronic terminological resources, our choice was to adopt the paradigms of Semantic Web technologies<a class=footnote-ref href=#bernerslee2001> [bernerslee2001] </a>and Linked (Open) Data<a class=footnote-ref href=#bizer2011> [bizer2011] </a>.</p><p>The intuition behind the Semantic Web is to shift from a Web of documents, viewed as separate data silos containing unstructured or semi-structured data, to a Web of data where open repositories of semantically enriched data can be accessed and interlinked. To make this vision concrete, the following technologies - often referred to as the Semantic Web layer cake or Semantic Web technology - are used: Resource Description Framework<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS), Web Ontology Language (OWL), Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL).</p><p>Semantic Web and Linked (Open) Data best practices require datasets to be published using RDF: data is described as triples in the form of Subject - Predicate - Object, where the Subject is a resource, the Object can be either a resource or a data value (such as a string of character or a number), and the Predicate (also called “property” ) relates the Subject and the Object together. Basically, a dataset in the Linked Data world is a set of triples.</p><p>OWL is a family of languages, based on RDF/XML, and recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium since 2004 for representing and sharing ontologies<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> on the Web. There are three variants of OWL, with different levels of expressiveness: OWL Lite, which supports a classification hierarchy and simple constraints; OWL DL, which provides the maximum expressiveness while retaining computational completeness and decidability, and OWL Full which allows for maximum expressiveness, resulting nonetheless undecidable.</p><p>In order to publish structured data on the Web in a way that they can be easily linked to each other, a number of rules was set up by Berners-Lee, known as Linked (Open) Data principles. According to them, each entity of a dataset must be uniquely identified by a special “address” called URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), each URI must be available on the Web via the HTTP protocol<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> , each look up of a URI must be answered with useful information and using standards, and finally, whenever possible, data should be linked to other data.</p><p>Over the last years, the Linked (Open) Data approach has attracted the attention of a linguistic community becoming more and more sensitive to the question of interoperability between resources. An increasing number of openly available and interconnected linguistic datasets have been published as part of the Web of data, resulting in the so-called Linked Open Data Cloud (LLOD). This trend, nicely visualised in<a href=https://lod-cloud.net>https://lod-cloud.net</a>, is particularly boosted by the Ontology Lexicon (Ontolex) community group, whose activity resulted in the creation of <em>lemon</em> <sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> (Lexicon Model for Ontologies), a meta-model allowing lexical resources to be published in RDF, linked and shared according to Semantic Web principles. At present <em>lemon</em> constitutes a standardde facto, as it is grounded on W3C and ISO standards, such as LMF (Lexical Markup Framework)<a class=footnote-ref href=#francopoulo2006> [francopoulo2006] </a>, Lexinfo<a class=footnote-ref href=#cimiano2011> [cimiano2011] </a>– this latter aligned with ISOCat - and LIR (Linguistic Information Repository)<a class=footnote-ref href=#montiel2008> [montiel2008] </a>.</p><p><em>Lemon</em> has been successfully adopted in many different contexts for different purposes, such as, for example, to publish several existing lexical resources as linked data, including DBnary<a class=footnote-ref href=#serasset2015> [serasset2015] </a>, the Parole-Simple-Clips Italian lexicon<a class=footnote-ref href=#delgratta2015> [delgratta2015] </a>, WordNet<a class=footnote-ref href=#mccrae2014> [mccrae2014] </a>, UBY<a class=footnote-ref href=#ecklekohler2015> [ecklekohler2015] </a>and BabelNet<a class=footnote-ref href=#ehrmann2014> [ehrmann2014] </a>, to represent linguistic resources for sentiment analysis within the EuroSentiment project<a class=footnote-ref href=#sanchezrada2014> [sanchezrada2014] </a>, to model linguistic annotations in FrameBase, a linked open knowledge base which integrates and interconnects heterogeneous sources of structured knowledge<a class=footnote-ref href=#rouces2017> [rouces2017] </a>.</p><p>The <em>lemon</em> core module, named <em>ontoLex</em> <sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup> , is composed of three fundamental elements: i) the <em>Lexical Entry</em> class, in turn specified in <em>Word</em> , <em>Multiword Expression</em> , and <em>Affix</em> ; ii) the <em>Lexical Form</em> class where the morphological variants of a lexical entry are described and associated with a written representation ( <em>writtenRep</em> ); iii) the <em>Lexical Sense</em> class, which constitutes the reification of the relationship between a lexical entry and an ontology entity defined in a given “external” ontology. In <em>lemon</em> , in fact, concepts, conceived as extra-linguistic entities, receive a formal and explicit description in a separate ontology, according to the principle known as “semantics by reference” <a class=footnote-ref href=#buitelaar2010>[buitelaar2010] </a>.</p><p>The <em>lemon</em> model has been designed to be modular and extensible: in other words, new modules can be created, if required, to represent a peculiar aspect of a lexical or terminological resource. To manage semantic shifts, for example, a diachronic extension, called <em>lemonDIA</em> , was developed<a class=footnote-ref href=#khan2014> [khan2014] </a>.</p><h2 id=4-models-and-tools-for-the-representation-of-diachrony>4. Models and Tools for the Representation of Diachrony</h2><p>Knowledge representation languages underlying Semantic Web technologies are based on binary relations. They typically connect two instances without any temporal information, thus making the representation of time a difficult matter to deal with. In order to tackle this issue, different approaches have been proposed in the literature (see inter al.<a href=#flouris2008>Flouris 2008</a>,<a href=#makri2011>Makri 2011</a>): Temporal Description logics<a class=footnote-ref href=#artale2000> [artale2000] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#lutz2008>[lutz2008] </a>, Versioning<a class=footnote-ref href=#klein2001> [klein2001] </a>, Reification<a class=footnote-ref href=#kanmani2016> [kanmani2016] </a>and 4D-fluents<a class=footnote-ref href=#welty2006> [welty2006] </a>. In the following, a brief description of each approach is provided.</p><p><em>Temporal Description Logics (TDL</em> ). Description logics (DLs)<a class=footnote-ref href=#baader2003> [baader2003] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#baader2001>[baader2001] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#calvanese2001>[calvanese2001] </a>are a family of knowledge representation formalisms underlying the Ontology Web Language (OWL-DL). They are a decidable subset of first-order logic. TDLs extend DL with standard temporal logic operators such as “always in the future” , and “until” . Many TDLs have been proposed in the literature<a class=footnote-ref href=#artale2000> [artale2000] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#lutz2008>[lutz2008] </a>with the most expressive of them being undecidable. Extending DL entails to extend OWL, which is based on DL. Since OWL is a W3C recommendation (2004) for publishing and sharing ontologies in a “Semantic Web vision” , adopting TDL would entail to abandon the Semantic Web framework. On the contrary, the other approaches described in the following can be implemented using OWL directly.</p><p><em>Versioning</em> . Another strategy commonly adopted to handle and keep track of ontology modifications in time is versioning: whenever a change takes place, a new version of the resource is created (see Figure 1). Several works are grounded on this approach: Grandi (<a href=#grandi2009>2009</a>) presents a multi-temporal RDF database model employing triple timestamping with temporal elements; Zekri et al. (<a href=#zekri2017>2017</a>) present an infrastructure and a suite of tools to support the creation and validation of OWL ontologies with time-varying instances; in Tappolet and Bernstein (<a href=#tappolet2009>2009</a>), the usage of Named Graphs is proposed.</p><p>The drawback of versioning approach is mainly twofold. Firstly, the fact that a new version of the whole resource needs to be created every time a change occurs leads to redundant information. Secondly, the more numerous the versions of the resource are, the more complex and time-consuming the performance of exhaustive searches becomes.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Shows steps of change from resource r0 to resource rn over time." src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

Reification is a technique for representing relationships with arity greater than two.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup> Reifying a relationship means representing it as a class of entities. The N-ary Relations pattern, conceived to model a relationship as a resource, is based on reification.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Two charts showing reification on the left and relation pattern on the right." src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,
800w, w" class=landscape><figcaption><p>Example related to the fact that the sense of the term _t i _ denotes the concept _c j _ : (a) example of reification - (b) example of N-ary relation pattern.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Figure 2(a) illustrates how the reification process works: the relation <em>denotes</em> is transformed into a class, here named <em>Reified relation</em> . The subject and the object of <em>denotes</em> , as well as the relation itself, become the attributes of the new class. Let us suppose that the relation <em>denotes</em> links a term ti(in particular its specific sense) to a concept cjat a specific time T0. As shown in Figure 2(b), the relationship <em>denotes</em> (ti, cj, T0) can be reified as the new class <em>DenotationEvent</em> with three binary relations: <em>denotes</em> (ti, de), <em>denotes</em> (de, cj), and <em>time</em> (de, T0). The first two relations link tito cjby means of de, which is an instance of the class <em>DenotationEvent</em> . The third relation assigns a temporal extent T0to de, representing the temporal validity of the original property <em>denotes</em> (ti, cj).</p><p>The main disadvantages of this technique are that: i) the complexity of the ontology increases due to the proliferation of entities, both classes and properties (as a matter of fact, whenever a temporal relation has to be represented, a new object is created); ii) the OWL reasoning capabilities become limited<a class=footnote-ref href=#welty2006> [welty2006] </a>and can be maintained only by means of time-consuming strategies, since the reified property is transformed into a class and the characteristics which can be added to a property in OWL (such as functionality, inverse functionality, transitivity or symmetry) are no longer associated directly with the relation itself.</p><p><em>4D-fluents (four-dimensionalist).</em> The basic idea underlying this approach is that each entity has a temporal part, described by a set of time slices. Each slice represents a temporal period, in which all the features of an entity remain constant. Changes affect the properties of the temporal part keeping the entity unchanged. In order to add the time dimension to a resource, the <em>TimeSlice</em> and <em>TimeInterval</em> classes with the <em>timeSliceOf</em> and <em>timeInterval</em> properties need to be introduced, as Figure 3 depicts. Returning to the previous example, in the 4D-fluents approach, the property <em>denotes</em> would connect instances of the <em>TimeSlice</em> class and would hold between slices of entities. The time slices of an entity have a specific lifetime, that is the time interval of the relation they participate in.</p><p>As in the N-ary model so also in the 4-D fluents approach the domain and the range of the property <em>denotes</em> change, both represented by the <em>TimeSlice</em> class. So, this model as well suffers from some limitations in OWL reasoning capabilities. With respect to the N-ary model, the 4-D fluents approach is affected by a wider proliferation of entities (compare the blue objects in Figure 2).</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Chart showing 4D-fluents representation." src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

In the next two subsections, we present a vocabulary to represent time-related facts, i.e. OWL-Time, and a set of rules, i.e. SWRL, which operate on temporal relations to infer new temporal knowledge and to detect inconsistent assertions.</p><h2 id=41-owl-time-and-allens-relations>4.1 OWL-Time and Allen’s Relations</h2><p>OWL-Time<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup> is an ontology of temporal concepts, conceived to describe the temporal properties of resources. It provides a vocabulary for expressing facts about topological relations among instants and intervals, together with information about durations and date-time. Figure 4(a) illustrates a diagram of OWL-Time ontology. The properties <em>hasTemporalDuration</em> , <em>hasBeginning</em> , <em>hasEnd</em> , and <em>hasTime</em> provide a standard way to attach time information to ontological entities.</p><p>Let us consider, for example, that the term tidenotes the concept cjfrom 1898 to 1903. In this case all the needed temporal facts can be specified using OWL-Time vocabulary.</p><p>However, if we wanted to answer questions like “What are the intervals overlapping the interval 1898-1903?” , or “what are the relations holding in that interval?” , OWL-Time vocabulary would not be enough. James F. Allen (<a href=#allen1983>1983</a>) provided then a calculus for temporal reasoning, by introducing thirteen base relations capturing the possible relations between two intervals (see Figure 4(b)). They allow the computation of any relative position or sequence. In the context of the Semantic Web, these rules can be represented by means of the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), described in the following section. The use of this language makes it possible to assert new instances of relationships between the ontology entities.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Two charts showing temporla entities on the left and Allen's rile between time periods on the right." src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

The form of these rules is an implication between an antecedent (body) and a consequent (head), each consisting of zero or a conjunction of more atoms.<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup> Whenever the conditions specified in the antecedent hold, then the conditions specified in the consequent must hold as well.

For example, the following SWRL rule infers if an instanti1is before an instanti2, by verifying a set of premises:</p><p>Instant(?i1) ∧ Instant(?i2) ∧ inXSDDateTime(?i1, ?y) ∧ inXSDDateTime(?i2, ?w) ∧swrl:lessThan(?y, ?w)→ before(?i2, ?i1)</p><p>where the built-in swrl:lessThan(?y, ?w) is satisfied when the date represented by the variable ?y is earlier than that represented by ?w.<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup> In this case, when temporal information is provided as a date, the qualitative relations are specified using SWRL rules that apply on the quantitative representation. The rules can be applied to qualitative temporal information as well. In the following, a rule about the relation <em>during</em> is provided:</p><p>ProperInterval(?a) ∧ ProperInterval(?x) ∧ before(?b, ?y) ∧ before(?z, ?c) ∧hasBeginning(?a, ?b) ∧ hasBeginning(?x, ?y) ∧ hasEnd(?a, ?c) ∧ hasEnd(?x, ?z)→ During(?x, ?a)</p><h2 id=5-adding-time-to-terminologies>5. Adding Time to Terminologies</h2><p>Given the different approaches to modelling time described in the previous section, we chose to adopt the N-ary model.</p><p>The reason for this choice is twofold. First of all, the N-ary relations approach is supported by the Ontology Engineering and Patterns Task Force of the Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment Working Group.<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup> Secondly, with respect to the perdurantist approach, the N-ary model requires the introduction of a smaller number of objects and thus “outperforms the 4D-fluents representation in terms of required assertions (axioms) and consequently in reasoning time” <a class=footnote-ref href=#batsakis2017>[batsakis2017] </a>.</p><p>In order to formalize terminology evolution following the N-ary approach, we took inspiration from the model introduced by Preventis et al. (2014)<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup> to handle temporal ontologies in OWL. In particular, we introduced the following entities:</p><ul><li>the class <em>Event</em> , which represents the reification of a property holding in a certain time. To model the class <em>Event</em> we used the relative type <em>dcmitype:Event</em> taken from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and defined as a “non-persistent, time-based occurrence” <sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup> ;</li><li>the object property <em>during</em> , having the class <em>dcmitype:Event</em> as domain and the class <em>time:ProperInterval</em> of the OWL-Time ontology as range. The latter is defined as “a temporal entity with non-zero extent or duration, i.e. for which the value of the beginning and end are different” .<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup> <em>during</em> has been modelled as a sub-property of <em>dcterms:date</em> (described as a “point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource” ) of the DCMI vocabulary<sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup> ;</li><li>the object property <em>temporalProperty</em> , which relates individuals of the class <em>dcmitype:Event</em> respectively to the source and to the target individuals of the original property which has been reified. As we will see in detail shortly, the object properties that are converted into temporal ones are formalised as sub-properties of <em>temporalProperty</em> .</li></ul><p>Following the N-ary approach outlined above, the terminological layer of our model was formalised by extending the <em>lemon</em> model. The model does not contain a complete collection of linguistic categories; consequently, it builds on Lexinfo ontology<sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup> in order to provide a vocabulary to describe the properties of linguistic objects. More specifically, the four lexico-semantic relationships defined in Lexinfo, namely synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy<sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup> were “temporalised” ( <em>temporalSynonym</em> , <em>temporalAntonym</em> , <em>temporalHypernym</em> , and <em>temporalHyponym</em> ) and thus converted into sub-properties of <em>temporalProperty</em> to indicate their involvement in a temporal event. The same was done for the properties <em>ontolex:reference</em> , which links every individual of the <em>ontolex:LexicalSense</em> class to a concept defined in an ontology, and <em>ontolex:sense</em> , linking an individual of the class <em>ontolex:LexicalEntry</em> to a specific sense.</p><p>In addition, each of these relations was reified and converted into subclasses of the class <em>dcmitype:Event</em> : <em>senseEvent</em> representing the reification of sense relation, <em>referenceEvent</em> representing the reification of the relation linking a sense and an ontology concept, <em>equivalentEvent</em> , <em>incompatibleEvent</em> , <em>broaderEvent</em> , <em>narrowerEvent</em> representing respectively the reification of synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, hyponymy relations holding between two senses.</p><p>The class <em>dcmitype:Event</em> as well as its subclasses mentioned above are related to the class <em>time:ProperInterval</em> through the object property <em>during</em> .</p><p>So, for example, in order to represent the temporal synonymy (Figure 5), the class <em>equivalentEvent</em> is related to the class <em>time:ProperInterval</em> through the relation <em>temporalSynonym</em> , specifying the time period in which the relation of synonymy holds between two senses.</p><p>As we can see, the introduction of an intermediate object, namely the individual of the class <em>equivalentEvent</em> , splits the static relation linking a subject and an object into two parts. Instead of a single triple linking two senses ( _s 1 _ sense _s 2 _ ), two triples are created, in which the individual of the class <em>equivalentEvent</em> appears as subject in one case and as object in the other.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="A flowchart beginning with the EquivalentEvent." src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

As we underlined above, to define in which period a term is used with a certain sense and to denote a specific concept, scholars need to resort to textual sources.</p><p>As a result, our model is based on the key concept of attestation; more specifically, the senses of a term are linked to the text where they are attested, and for each text the writing time is defined by means of specific relations. To represent texts and attestations, as the main entities constituting the textual layer of our model, we introduced the following entities:</p><ul><li>the class <em>Text</em> , which represents every work produced in a written form. As many methodological and theoretical works have underlined over the years, the notion of text is highly complex and culturally rich and, thus, difficult to define and formalize. A detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this article. The term “text” is to be understood here in a broad sense, including entities that are very different from each other, such as books, published articles, handwritten notes, drafts of unfinished works etc. It can be considered equivalent to the type “ Text ” as defined in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Type Vocabulary ( <em>dcmitype:Text</em> ), namely a “resource whose content is primarily words for reading” .<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup> If scholars need to use vocabularies providing more subtle distinctions, many models for representing documents in Linked Data have been already proposed, offering an opportunity for high quality bibliographic data to be exposed to the Semantic Web, such as FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records)<a class=footnote-ref href=#carlyle2011> [carlyle2011] </a>or Bibframe (Bibliographic Framework)<a class=footnote-ref href=#kroeger2013> [kroeger2013] </a>.

In fact, only in rare cases he/she can define with certainty the extent of the period in which an author has worked on drafting a text, with the aid of internal elements or external sources (for example, the author explicitly declares that he/she has written that work in a certain period, etc.).</p><p>In most cases, on the contrary, temporal information on the writing process is vague and ambiguous and partially bounded intervals ( “before X” , “after Y” , etc.) need to be defined. Instead of specifying the exact duration or the starting and ending points in time, scholars describe intervals with respect to their mutual relations, by establishing theterminus post quemor theterminus ante quem, namely the limits of the possible range of dates in which a work has been written.<sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup></p><p>As for published texts, instead of the <em>hasWritingTime</em> property, the <em>dcterms:issued</em> <sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup> can be used, with the year of publication constituting the end of the drafting period.</p><p>An overview of the model is illustrated in Figure 6.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="A visualization of layers of the proposed model." src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

The premise of the rule is composed of the following steps: i) an anonymous individual <em>se</em> is created <em>ex novo</em> in the antecedent part of the rule using the <em>createOWLThing</em> built-in relation<sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup> ; ii) <em>se</em> is defined, in the consequent part, as an event representing the reified relation (in particular by instantiating it as a member of the class <em>senseEvent</em> ); iii) the property <em>temporalSense</em> is used to relate the lexical entry <em>l</em> to <em>se</em> and, in turn, to relate <em>se</em> to sense <em>s</em> ; iv) finally, the event <em>se</em> is defined as happening in the same time interval <em>i</em> during which the text has been written.</p><p>If the sense of a lexical entry is attested in more than one text (each one written in a specific temporal interval), the rule will be fired for each text, thus relating the lexical entry to that sense in a more complex period constituted of multiple time intervals.</p><p>Similarly, the temporal validity of the <em>ontolex:reference</em> relation, linking each <em>ontolex:LexicalSense</em> to one and only one concept of an ontology, can be inferred from the writing time of the text as well, using the following SWRL rule:</p><p>Text(?t) ^ time:ProperInterval(?i) ^ hasWritingTime(?t, ?int) ^ontolex:LexicalSense(?s) ^ isAttestedIn(?s, ?t) ^ Concept(?c) ^ ontolex:reference(?s,?c) ^ swrlx:createOWLThing(?re, ?c)⇾ referenceEvent(?re) ^ temporalReference(?s, ?re) ^ temporalReference(?re, ?c) ^during(?re, ?i)</p><p>If a sense <em>s</em> is linked to a concept <em>c</em> through the (synchronic) <em>ontolex:reference</em> property, and if <em>s</em> is attested in a specific text <em>t</em> written in the time interval <em>i</em> , then, in a diachronic perspective, the relation reference holds in the same time interval <em>i</em> as well. In other words, the fact that a word is used with a particular sense in a specific text is equivalent to saying that in that period that term was used to express that specific concept.</p><p>Figures 7 and 8 show respectively how the temporal versions of ontolex relations <em>ontolex:sense</em> and <em>ontolex:reference</em> can be automatically inferred by a reasoner and represented in our N-ary model starting from the writing time of texts.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Flow chart beginning with the SenseEvent." src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

The Construction of a Diachronic Resource: the Saussure Case Study</h2><p>Ferdinand de Saussure (Geneva, 1857-1913), the father of general linguistics, never published his theories on general linguistics and semiotics in an organic work. He strove to structure the flow of his thoughts and ideas in handwritten notes, which are often characterized by a synthetic, fragmentary and hermetic nature. These manuscripts display an obsessive and constant search for clear, effective and unambiguous terms, against the “ineptie de la terminologie courante” (Letter to Meillet written in 1984, see<a href=#benveniste1964>Benveniste 1964</a>). He changed the meaning to some terms over time, assigned additional specific meanings to already existing terms, used some expressions ephemerally, and even forged new words. This terminological fluctuation reflects the difficulties underlying every process of theoretical creation and sheds light on the evolutionary dynamics through which concepts take shape and cut through language to finally find their linguistic expression. This process ofrumination<a class=footnote-ref href=#fenoglio2012> [fenoglio2012] </a>is typical when dealing with theoretical terminologies as in the case of Saussure, who tries to revolutionize the current linguistic vision and to lay the foundations of linguistics as a science.</p><p>Saussure’s terminology has been the subject of numerous studies<a class=footnote-ref href=#godel1957> [godel1957] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#engler1968>[engler1968] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#cosenza2016>[cosenza2016] </a>. In 2011 the first electronic thesaurus of Saussure&rsquo;s terminology, named <em>Simple_FdS</em> <a class=footnote-ref href=#ruimy2013>[ruimy2013] </a>, was built as part of the project “Per una edizione digitale dei manoscritti di F. de Saussure” , coordinated by then President of the Cercle Ferdinand de Saussure Daniele Gambarara.</p><p>The architecture of <em>Simple_FdS</em> was based on the lexical model SIMPLE<a class=footnote-ref href=#lenci2000> [lenci2000] </a>and was therefore inspired by the Generative Lexicon theory elaborated by Pustejovsky (<a href=#pustejovsky1995>1995</a>). The Generative Lexicon theory, mainly applied to general language, has proved to be very effective in the description of specialized language and terminological lexicons as well (for example<a href=#arauz2012>Aráuz et al. 2012</a>,<a href=#sanchezibanez2014>Sánchez Ibáñez and García Palacios 2014</a>), as it makes it possible to enrich the range of conceptual relations which is traditionally based on generic-specific and part-whole relations.</p><p>Initially, the electronic lexicon was conceived as static and no diachronic aspects were taken into account. Recently, as we shall illustrate in Section 6.1, the model here proposed has been adopted to convert this terminological resource from a static repository into a dynamic one.</p><p>As underlined in Section 2, in diachronic terminology the textual dimension plays a crucial role. Consequently, the first step was to build a good corpus, able to represent the diachronic evolution we want to study. The texts included in Saussure’s corpus can be considered as highly representative of diachronic evolution of Saussure’s terminology, embracing all the thirty-seven years in which the intellectual activity of the Genevan linguist unfolded. The period covered by the corpus ranges from 1874 - when Saussure wrote his first <em>Essai pour réduire les mots du grec, du latin & de l&rsquo;allemand à un petit nombre de racines</em> - until 1911, the year in which he took the third course of general linguistics, the last academic teaching held before his death, which occurred in 1913 after a long illness.</p><p>Let us see in detail an example of the formalisation of the terminological changes occurring in Saussure&rsquo;s writings.</p><h2 id=61-temporalizing-saussures-terminology-the-case-ofsigne>6.1 Temporalizing Saussure&rsquo;s Terminology: the Case ofSigne</h2><p>As is well known, Saussure&rsquo;s theories have been particularly influential in semiotic studies. He emphasized first the dyadic and complex nature of linguistic sign, which consists of two heterogeneous entities: a signifier (signifiant), namely the hearer’s psychological impression of a sound, and a signified (signifié), i.e. a concept, an abstract idea. This terminology - still in use today - was introduced by the Genevan linguist at the end of his life, after a long theoretical reflection emerging in many of his handwritten pages.</p><p>Here, as an example, the concept of SIGNIFIER was chosen and the formal representation of the different terms Saussure used over time to designate this concept is illustrated, in accordance with the N-ary model we propose here. In the following, the relationships and the classes taken from existing standard vocabularies will be indicated with prefixes of the respective vocabularies.</p><p>The concept of SIGNIFIER is denoted by many different terms in Saussurean manuscripts, such assigne,image acoustique,image verbale,image vocale,image auditive,son,forme. More specifically, the termsigneis attested intermittently from 1891 to 1911 in many works, such as <em>De la double essence du langage, Status et Motus, Notes Item, Troisième Cours de linguistique générale</em> etc. To formally represent this, the instance <em>signe_sense</em> , belonging to the <em>ontolex:LexicalSense</em> class, was created and linked - by means of the relation <em>isAttestedIn</em> - to the instances of the class <em>dcmitype:Text</em> representing all the works where the term occurs. The writing period of each text was formally defined. Here the case of <em>Double Essence du language</em> is shown. The instance <em>Double_Essence_Writing_Time</em> of the class <em>time:ProperInterval</em> (subclass of <em>time:Interval</em> ) was created and linked to the instance <em>Double_Essence</em> through the relation <em>hasWritingTime</em> . The writing interval of this work, which is supposed to range from 1891 to 1892,<sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup> was formally defined by linking the instance <em>Double_Essence_Writing_Time</em> through the relation <em>time:hasBeginning</em> to an instance of the class <em>time:Instant</em> , defined by the Data Property <em>XSDDateTime</em> with value “1891-01-01T00:00:00” as well as through the relation <em>time:hasEnd</em> to an instance of the class <em>time:Instant</em> , defined by the Data Property <em>XSDDateTime</em> with value “1892-12-31T00:00:00” . The same formalisation was performed for each work where this sense of <em>signe</em> was attested.</p><p>As described in Section 5, on the basis of the N-ary approach here adopted, ontolex relations were reified and the following classes were introduced as subclass of <em>dcmitype:Event</em> : <em>broaderEvent</em> (reification of the hypernym relation); <em>narrowerEvent</em> (reification of the hyponym relation); <em>incompatibleEvent</em> (reification of the antonymy relation); <em>equivalentEvent</em> (reification of the synonymy relation), <em>referenceEvent</em> (reification of the inter-level relation <em>reference</em> ) and finally <em>senseEvent</em> (reification of the relation linking a lexical entry to its senses).</p><p>By firing the two rules illustrated in Section 5, the classes <em>referenceEvent</em> and <em>senseEvent</em> were automatically populated. More specifically, in accordance with the first rule, the instance <em>signe_sense_ts</em> was created and linked by means of the relation <em>temporalSense</em> both to <em>signe_sense</em> (individual of the <em>ontolex:LexicalSense</em> class) and to <em>signe_entry</em> (individual of the <em>ontolex:LexicalEntry</em> class). Similarly, by firing the second rule, the individual <em>signe_sense_ref_signifiant_concept</em> was created and linked by the relation <em>temporalReference</em> both to <em>signe_sense</em> and to an ontology concept, described in the <em>Simple_FdS</em> ontology.</p><p>As underlined above, a terminological fluctuation can be observed in Saussure&rsquo;s work as regard to the designation of the concept SIGNIFIER.</p><p>An attempt to completely renew semiotic terminology is attested in the so-called <em>Notes Items</em> . In these handwritten pages, defined by Stetter (<a href=#stetter1979>1979</a>) as a “fragment sémiologique central” , Saussure’s reflection upon linguistic sign achieved extraordinary theoretical heights. Many heterodox neologisms were introduced, such assème,sème linguistique,aposème,kenôme,sôme,contre-sômeetc. Here the “material” part of linguistic sign, namely the “signifier” , is denoted in certain passages by the termaposème. This terminology is abandoned later and the termsignecontinues to be used to indicate at the same time the “material” part of the linguistic sign and the whole, namely the combination of SIGNIFIED (concept) and SIGNIFIER (acoustic image). In order to avoid the confusion that the polysemy of the termsignegenerated in his students, Saussure introducedin extremisthe termsignifiant, during his last course on general linguistics in 1911. He proposed thus to retain the wordsigneto designate the linguistic entity as a whole, and to replace the dyad <em>signe</em> and <em>concept</em> respectively bysignifiantandsignifié.</p><p>To formalise this terminological fluctuation, the instance <em>signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense</em> of the <em>equivalentEvent</em> class was created and the static triple ( <em>signe_sense</em> <em>lexinfo:synonymy aposème_sense</em> ) was split into the following two triples in accordance with the N-ary model: ( <em>signe temporalSynonym signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense</em> ) and ( <em>signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense temporalSynonym aposème</em> ). The instance <em>signe_sense_syn_aposème_sense</em> was then linked to the interval <em>Notes_Item_Writing_Interval</em> by means of the relation <em>during</em> .</p><p>In a similar way, the instance <em>signe_sense_syn_signifiant_sense</em> of the <em>equivalentEvent</em> class was created and linked via <em>temporalSynonym</em> to the individual <em>signifiant</em> . The instance <em>signe</em> was in turn linked - by means of the same relation - to the instance <em>signe_sense_syn_signifiant_sense</em> , belonging to the reified class <em>equivalentEvent</em> . Finally, the instance was linked to the interval <em>troisième_Cours_Interval</em> (with beginning 1910 and end 1911) by means of the relation <em>during</em> .</p><h2 id=62-querying-saussures-diachronic-terminology>6.2 Querying Saussure&rsquo;s Diachronic Terminology</h2><p>Such a formalization, even if complex and redundant, makes it possible to reconstruct on a timeline the evolution of the lexical-semantic relationships between senses as well as the relations holding between senses and concepts, and then to answer complex and sophisticated queries. Here are just a few of the many queries which can be performed:</p><ul><li>Which are the terms used over time to denote a concept <em>c</em> ?</li><li>Which are the terms attested in a specific time interval <em>i</em> and used to denote a concept <em>c</em> ?</li><li>Which are the terms attested in a specific time interval <em>i</em> which are synonym (antonym or hypernym or hyponym) of the term <em>t</em> ?</li><li>Which are the terms synonyms of the term <em>t</em> in a specific text <em>T</em> ?</li><li>Which are the concepts denoted by the term <em>t</em> over time?</li><li>Which are the concepts denoted by the term <em>t</em> in a specific time interval <em>i</em> ?</li></ul><p>Returning to our Saussure’s case study, let us suppose, for example, that scholars would like to know which terms have been used by the Genevan linguist over time as synonyms of the termsigne(in the sense ofsigne linguistique, namely “l’union de l’idée avec ce produit phonatoire” ).</p><p>The query results are represented here in the form of a graph (Figure 9), as they appear in LexO, a collaborative web editor of lexical and termino-ontological resources, developed by the Institute of Computational Linguistics of the Italian National Research Council (ILC-CNR) and already used within several research projects, such as DiTMAO<a class=footnote-ref href=#bellandi2018> [bellandi2018] </a>and Totus Mundus<a class=footnote-ref href=#piccini2018> [piccini2018] </a>.<sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup></p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Screenshot of interface showing synonyms ofsigne." src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,
800w, w" class=landscape><figcaption><p>The synonyms of the termsigneused by Saussure between 1890 and 1911</p></figcaption></figure><p>As clearly appears in the graph, the formalization previously described makes it emerge immediately Saussure’s unceasing and obsessive work in search for the term that best represented the concept.</p><p>In an initial period, spanning approximately from 1891 and 1892, Saussure introduces three interesting neologisms:signe-idée,son-idéeandforme-sens. These three nominal compounds well reflect the fact that the linguistic sign is composed of two parts that are closely connected as the two sides of a piece of paper. In effect, the bipartite structure of the terms mirrors the dyadic nature of the linguistic sign. Each element of the compound denotes one of the two parts composing the linguistic sign. More specifically, the first constituent of the compound refers to the signifier, i.e. the sound-image (signe,son,forme), while the second element denotes the conceptual side, the idea conveyed by the sign (idée,sens).</p><p>Later, in a time span ranging from 1899 to 1903, Saussure renamessigneassèmeand distinguishes it from its “material” constituent, namedaposèmeorsômeand from its conceptual part, designated asparasômeorcontre- sôme, thus introducing a constellation of neologisms derived from ancient Greek, as is usual in scientific terminology. All these neologisms are abandoned and no longer adopted by the Genevan linguist who prefers to continue using more traditional terms such asmot,terme,signe linguistique. These terms are all attested in the third course of general linguistics held by Saussure in Geneva between 1910 and 1911. Here Saussure definitely chooses the termsigneto indicate the whole resulting from the association of form, namedsignifiant, and meaning, namedsignifié, thus resolving the ambiguity that until then had characterized the termsigne: “L&rsquo;ambiguïté disparaîtrait si l&rsquo;on désignait les trois notions ici en présence par des noms qui s&rsquo;appellent les uns les autres tout en s&rsquo;opposant. Nous proposons de conserver le mot signe pour désigner le total, et de remplacer concept et image acoustique respectivement par signifié et signifiant; ces derniers termes ont l’avantage de marquer l’opposition qui les sépare soit entre eux, soit du total dont ils font partie. [&mldr;]” <a class=footnote-ref href=#saussure1972>[saussure1972] </a>.</p><p>Another query focussing on the period of attestation of the termsignein all its meanings brings out this ambiguity more clearly, as illustrated in Figure 10.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Screenshot of the interface showing the meaningsigneduring its attestation period." src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

Saussure is aware of this and therefore during his last course on general linguistics – and more precisely on May 19 1911 – proposes to preserve the termsignein its third sense and to replace it with the neologismsignifiantas for the second meaning.</p><p>As Saussure’s case study demonstrates, models and tools devoted to representing and querying diachronic terminological resources play a crucial role in order to better understand the terminological fluctuation and the mobile and progressive conceptualisation which characterize some unstable phases of science.</p><h2 id=7-conclusion-and-next-steps>7. Conclusion and Next Steps</h2><p>Representing the diachronic evolution of terminological and conceptual data in a formal way constitutes a challenge, since standard formalisms adopted in the Semantic Web for the representation of data have mainly been conceived for static and monotonic information.</p><p>In this work we have proposed a Semantic Web-based model for representing in an explicit and formal way the diachronic evolution of concepts and terms in a given domain, accompanied by a concrete use case focussing on the evolution of linguistic terminology as attested in Ferdinand De Saussure’s writings. The temporalization approach illustrated here is domain independent and can be virtually applied to any RDF data model. The main drawback is that such an approach requires a significant design effort in modelling and encoding specific sets of temporal rules. In addition, the properties to be temporalized need to be already known at the modelling time. However, in slightly “controlled” domains like terminology and lexicography, our approach turns out to be effective to describe the historical development of a language, and its many temporal variations.</p><p>The next research objectives are: i) the enrichment of the model, ii) the exploitation of the resource, iii) the extension of the tool LexO to support the construction of diachronic resources<a class=footnote-ref href=#bellandi2018> [bellandi2018] </a>.<sup id=fnref:28><a href=#fn:28 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>28</a></sup></p><p>As far as the enrichment of the model is concerned, we plan to design new SWRL rules for the automatic temporalization of lexico-semantic properties holding between senses, such as synonymy, antonymy etc.</p><p>In addition, in order to manage the cases when the writing period of a text is uncertain, we intend to develop an algorithm exploiting the resource for automatic dating suggestion: the behaviour of terms in those texts, whose writing time is known, will be used to advance hypotheses on the uncertain (or even unknown) writing time periods of the other texts belonging to the corpus under analysis. Needless to say, the accuracy of suggested time periods will be proportionate to the amount of (certain) temporal information already encoded in the diachronic resource.</p><p>Finally, we are working to extend the tool LexO as to include the management of texts and temporal information. The tool will be designed to relieve scholars from the time consuming (and prone to errors) task of formalising the large amount of entities required to represent the temporal information according to the N-ary model. In addition, thanks to LexO scholars will not be required to manage the formalisms and the languages underlying the Web Semantic technologies such as RDF and OWL.</p><p>The first extension of the tool LexO aimed at the inclusion of temporal information will involve the integration of functions for the management of text. As discussed in Section 2, diachronic terminology is a textual terminology, and terms have to be analysed in their contexts of use. For this reason, LexO will be equipped with a module through which users will be able to import their documents and the relative time information (writing time, date of publishing, etc.), organize them into folders, browse them and link each encoded term to the relative attestations in the corpus.</p><ul><li id=allen1983>Allen, J.
