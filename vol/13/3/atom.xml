<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The management of ever-vaster amounts of information that bombard us daily is one of the most important challenges we have been facing since the broad availability of the Internet. Technological developments during this time have drastically changed our abilities to access, process, and transfer information. In particular, the popularity of Web 2.0, which places human interaction and collaboration at its center, has led to massive amounts of available data. Additionally, other types of data are made available, including the contents of individual books that are integrated into bigger and bigger networks of texts, usurped by the continuously expanding structures of online databases. Google, as well as non-profit organizations such as Project Gutenberg, the Million Book Project and the Internet Archive, carry out large-scale projects to scan and upload the contents of whole libraries at a time. Kevin Kelly, co-founder of  <em>Wired</em>  magazine rejoices:    “[o]nce books are digital, books seep out of their bindings and weave themselves together. The collective intelligence of a library allows us to see things we can’t see in a single, isolated book”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  . So far, Google has scanned and made available over 30 million books. It would take a human an estimated twenty thousand years to read such a vast collection at the reasonable pace of two hundred words per minute, without interruptions for food or sleep <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Projects that make available great amounts of data, however, pose what Matthew Wilkens calls a  “problem of abundance” :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t read any faster than we ever did, even as the quantity of text produced grows larger by the year. If we need to read books in order to extract information from them and if we need to have read things in common in order to talk about them, we’re going to spend most of our time dealing with a relatively small set of texts. … each of us reads only a truly minuscule fraction of contemporary fiction (on the order of 0.1 percent, often much less). … we need to decide what to ignore.<br>
<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The field of Digital Humanities (DH) aims to offer methodological innovations to solve this problem of abundance. Since 2000, many have followed Franco Moretti&rsquo;s provocative call for distant reading. Moretti deemed close reading  “a theological exercise”  and urged humanists to  “read less” . According to some big data theorists, the act of sampling is    “an artifact of a period of information scarcity, a product of the natural constraints on interacting with information in an analog era”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  . With rich metadata and computational pattern matching, difficult texts like  <em>The Making of Americans</em> , are now  <em>not-readable</em>  in important new ways <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> (see also <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Els Stronks has opined we should make the gap between close and distant as wide as possible by further developing distant reading techniques, and at the same time making our close readings more precise and skillful in order to interpret the results gained by computational analysis <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Juxtaposition of the two, however, is mostly a polemical issue or rhetorical strategy. According to Jeremy Rosen (2011), Wilkens makes it seem like we have to choose between methods. Distant reading is not a replacement but a supplement or alternative to traditional close reading practices. On the contrary,    “[t]he availability of voluminous electronic data, one might conclude, makes it even more necessary to cultivate the faculty of analyzing data closely and critically”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  . Indeed, in his study (2013) of changes in the geographic imagination of American fiction around the Civil War, Wilkens exclusively makes use of distant reading techniques. Yet, close and distant reading are by no means antithetical <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moretti&rsquo;s argument in  “Slaughterhouse of Literature”  (2000) for instance, as one of the first applications of his distant reading methods, relies entirely on manual annotation of 108 detective stories, read by human beings in a graduate seminar (if not exactly  “close reading,”  reading for clues involves at least skimming the text). Many other works that are usually taken as representative of distant reading rely extensively on manual annotation or close readings of illustrative literary passages. So contrary to Moretti’s somewhat provocative proposition of distant reading as alternative to close reading, his work typifies the importance of human reading and tabulation. Yohei Igarashi <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> has shown how the interrelatedness between close and non-close reading predates the digital humanities, as it occurs at least since educational word lists of the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>A brief survey of how different scales of analyses are connected in actual literary-critical practice will show us that indeed, close and distant reading were never mutually exclusive. In DH, this work has mostly been carried out in literary history — see, for instance, a recent study on race, religion, and the US novel <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Stephen Ramsay, in his book  <em>Reading Machines</em>  (2011), offers different methods to engage in what he calls    “algorithmic criticism,”   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>   criticism derived from algorithmic manipulation of text. Ramsay holds that we should not take close reading to be diametrically opposed to computational, data-driven approaches, since there are important similarities between the two. Both methods are interpretive, in the sense that they transform the original text into something else.    “The critic who endeavors to put forth a  “reading,”  puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced”   <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  . But the same is true for a computer-driven distant reading where the original text is converted to information by an algorithm. In a recent issue of  <em>PMLA</em> , moreover, several scholars reflect on ways to nuance Moretti’s statements on  “not reading,”  effectively reducing the distance between the two textual approaches <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For a good overview of papers combining close and distant reading from 2005-2015, see <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. They argue that most papers that combine the two usually follow the  “Information Seeking Mantra” :    “Overview first, zoom &amp; filter, details on demand”   <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  . The output of a distant reading is then an overview of the data that highlights potentially interesting patterns for close reading. They call this most common form of connecting scales of analysis top-down: first, a distant view on the textual data is shown, and later the details come into view. One can think of the reading of Christina Rossetti in Ted Underwood’s  “The Longue Durée of Literary Prestige”  (2016). Underwood collected two samples of English-language poetry from 1820–1919: one from volumes reviewed in prominent periodicals, and one of an obscure author, randomly chosen from a large digital library. Looking at 360 reviewed and 360 random volumes, his study assessed the strength of the relationship between poetic language and reception. The approach taken was to first look at broad patterns, and then zoom in and read a few revealing passages. Likewise, in a recent study of novelty in modernist texts <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, scholars first measure intratextual novelty and then use close reading of a sample to test the measurements, scores, and graphs. Another <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> analyzes textual scale as a structuring principle of geographical, spatial scale in studying the pre-modern world, by not-reading tens of thousands of Renaissance books.</p>
<p>Stanford Lit Lab pamphlet 4 <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> traces macroscopic changes in the British novel during the nineteenth century. It signals two interrelated transformations in novelistic language during this period: a systemic concretization of language and a change in the social spaces of the novel. The authors research quantifiable features such as word usage, adopting a    “dialogic approach that oscillates between the historical and the semantic, between empirical word frequencies that reveal the historical trends of words and semantic taxonomies that help us identify the meaning and content of those trends”   <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  . Through their    “hypothesis-testing mode of interpretation”   <sup id="fnref2:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  , they make sure their results are semantically and culturally interpretable. This way, they offer a possible answer to what Alan Liu has called the  “meaning problem”  at the heart of the digital humanities: to determine the relation between    “quantitative interpretation and humanly meaningful qualitative interpretation”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  . As a certain measure of sampling when researching literary history is unavoidable, the issue of canon vesus archive is of import here <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. In digital research, a researcher often works according to a process that Jo Guldi <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> calls winnowing: careful culling and fine-tuning of the algorithm to get rid of false positives or messy data, towards cleaner data and clearer results. In that respect, it is in fact not so far removed from more traditional approaches such as close reading the single text.</p>
<p>Therefore, we follow this trend in mixing qualitative and quantitative methods and using them to analyze corpora that solicit readings that zoom in and out between part and whole. But rather than following the top-down approach or the  “Information Seeking Mantra,”  in our mixed method, manual annotation is not of a sample that follows from the overview produced by the distant reading, but a method that comes before the LDA analyses, to evaluate its workings and to reflect on its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>We believe that this mostly literary-historical body of work since Moretti, especially concerning the    “great unread”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>   has value when it comes to the current  “information overload”  that we exemplify here using a case study from web platform Reddit. Here, we propose a transfer from the literary to non-literary informational contexts. What is interesting for our purpose here is not some presumed binary between close and distant reading. It is, rather, the collective recognition, since Moretti, that literary history is not a clearly demarcated, well-mapped, and exhaustible field, but an    “uncharted expanse”   <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>   whose macroscopic shape we cannot fully know. This is true, albeit in a different, non-historical sense, for online web forums. By using a mixed method of manual annotation and LDA, we propose a means to confront this other, contemporary version of the    “great unread”   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  . Other studies <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> rely and build on the readings and value judgments of other professional readers to select their corpus. In  “testing”  and  “correcting”  previous gender and genre classifications of their peers, such studies have a strong sense of tradition that studies of a contemporary phenomenon such as Reddit threads obviously lack.</p>
<p>As announced, we propose a strategy for using manual annotation to evaluate and supplement an LDA model. Our analysis incorporates local annotation in a distant reading. The investigation requires the development of computational tools (e.g., topic identification, summarization) that deal with large amounts of documents. This should provide large patterns in the dataset that enable a fine-grained analysis of interesting parts of the data. Additionally, in-depth, qualitative inspection of the performance of the computational analyses is essential, in order to evaluate the computational approach.</p>
<p>In this article, we investigate whether we can analyze a large document collection from a distant reading perspective, indicating the different semantics of the texts within the entire collection. This analysis is compared against a manual, close reading analysis, to be able to evaluate the performance of the computational approach. If the computational technique behaves similarly to the manual approach, we can effectively use a distant reading technique to complement the close reading analysis. Summarizing, our approach entails a comparative analysis of the two reading methodologies: a close reading with manual annotation on the one hand, and a distant reading with topic modeling on the other. In order to explore both close and distant reading methods, we begin by annotating the data both manually and computationally. This way, we can reflect on and distillate the most valuable properties from both approaches. At the same time we can evaluate the suitability of generic computational techniques to high-quality manual analysis.</p>
<p>In order to explore the possible strategies that are located between the extremes of distant and close reading, we focus on a selected discussion thread of the popular online forum Reddit. Applying reading strategies from a literary studies context to this non-literary environment provides us a valuable insight into the merits of these strategies in an age of digital information. Furthermore, the Reddit thread is large enough to identify higher level patterns and manageable enough for manual analysis. Additionally, the posts within the thread, which pose suitable units of information, are expected to have different semantic content.</p>
<p>We will first give an overview of the close and distant reading methods employed on a conceptual level, and then outline how we operationalized them in this research. Following this, results of the comparison between the results found using the two methods are presented and discussed in the context of efficiently combining close and distant reading. This shows in how far we can use computational techniques as a pre-processing phase to relieve us from a large part of the labor-intensive work, enabling close reading of the interesting parts of huge data collections, an informed choice based on the results of the computational analysis. Lastly, we summarise the results and propose next steps.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h2 id="close-reading">Close Reading</h2>
<p>Close reading is an umbrella term for an assortment of reading strategies characterized by devout and detailed attention to the meaning and composition of art works. The approach was made famous by the New Critics, a group of Anglo-American literary scholars including Cleanth Brooks, William K. Wimsatt, and Monroe C. Beardsley. Inspired by I.A. Richards (author of  <em>Practical Criticism</em> , 1929), Matthew Arnold, and T.S. Eliot, these scholars experienced their heyday of academic fame in the forties and fifties of the last century. Going against contemporary practices that, in their view, overvalued historical context and biographical information, the New Critics suggested that literary scholars should investigate the text itself. They wrote extensively on certain contemporary fallacies of literary analysis, for instance, letting your own emotions factor into the interpretation (the    “affective fallacy”   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  ) or writing about authorial intentions (the    “intentional fallacy”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  ). Another practice they attacked was the paraphrasing of the contents or message of a work (the    “heresy of paraphrase”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  ).<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  Instead, this school propagated the careful examination of evidence offered by the text itself: images, symbols, and metaphors as part of a larger structure that gives the text its unity and meaning. Of particular interest to the close reader were devices that create ambiguities, paradoxes, irony, and other forms of tension within the text. Moving from close to distant reading, the level of analysis shifts from details within single texts to categories of many texts.</p>
<h2 id="distant-reading">Distant Reading</h2>
<p>Distant reading is the practice of aggregating and processing information about, or content in, large bodies of texts without the necessity of a human reader to read these texts <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. Distant reading corresponds to quantifying, computational reading methods and was introduced by Franco Moretti with the intention to identify the bigger picture in large collections of textual data that close reading cannot uncover.  “Reading”  is outsourced to a computer: it is in fact a form of data mining that allows information in (e.g., subjects, places, actors) or about (e.g., author, title, date, number of pages) the text to be processed and analyzed. The latter are called metadata: data about the data. Natural language processing can analyze the contents of  “practically unreadably”  large corpora of texts, while with data mining we can expose patterns or summarize on a scale that is beyond human capacity.</p>
<p>In his book  <em>Distant Reading</em>  (2013) Franco Moretti introduces the term polemically in explicit opposition to close reading, which, to his mind, fails to uncover the true scope of literature. Moretti is founder of the Stanford Literary Lab that seeks to confront literary  “problems”  by scientific means – computational modeling, hypothesis-testing, automatic text processing, algorithmic criticism, and quantitative analysis. The Lab’s first pamphlet suggested that literary genres  “possess distinctive features at every possible scale of analysis”  and that there are formal aspects of literature that people, unaided, cannot detect <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. The second pamphlet used network theory to re-envision plots <sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Since then, Jockers (2013) has further developed distant reading in what he has called  “macroanalysis” , a new approach to the literary reading and study designed for exploring digital texts in large quantities. Using computational tools to retrieve keywords, key phrases, and linguistic patterns across thousands of digital texts in databases allows researchers to attain quantifiable evidence on how literary trends have evolved over time and geographically. It can also determine what social, cultural, and historical connections exist between individual authors, texts, and genres <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. In this article, we seek to combine such a macro-scaled method with close reading and manual annotation, and apply it to a non-literary dataset.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<p>The text corpus used in the research described in this article comes from Reddit, a social content aggregation website and the self-styled front page of the internet. Functioning as    “a bulletin of user-submitted text, links, photos, and videos ”   <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  , it is a message board wherein users submit content and discuss this content in different communities. The website is further referred to as a    “social voting site”   <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>   as users (often referred to as redditors) vote submitted content up or down, sending the submissions with most upvotes to the Front page, i.e., the home page of reddit.com. Content on Reddit is organized in communities, so called subreddits. The nearly 900,000 communities of Reddit are organized around different topics like Technology, WorldNews, Music, Gaming, or PoliticalDiscussion. A single subreddit can be reached via, for example,  <em>reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion</em> . The single posts in one community are referred to as submissions. A submission usually contains a link, embedded images, gifs, or videos and may also contain a text written by the posting redditor. It is of special interest for textual analysis that other redditors can comment on a submission and reply to other comments. The comments are organized in a thread, a tree-like structure that allows for following the discussion chronologically and with regard to content. From any comment (every branch of the tree) further comments can emerge that yet again may receive comments (as more branches sprouting from the prior branch). Furthermore, redditors can make use of basic text formatting functions, such as quoting text of prior comments or highlighting. The text of the original submission and the comments on this submission are the primary source of information of this research.</p>
<p>The thread that formed the basis of our dataset was submitted on January 19th of 2017, and posed the following question:  <em>Should the Democrats nominate a celebrity in 2020? What would be the pros and cons?</em> <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  Furthermore, the users added certain sub-questions, like:  <em>Would celebrity power help or hurt a presidential nominee in the next election?</em>  and  <em>If this plan actually goes forward, who would be the best choice?</em> . Our dataset consists of 449 (461 including deleted comments) responses to these questions. Since the thread is still open, comments have been added after we collected and investigated our dataset. These new comments are not included in our research.</p>
<p>While investigations using Reddit data often aim at uncovering trends across single discussions and even across discussion forums (subreddits) (cf. <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>), the highest level of distant reading analysis in this research is on the level of a single discussion thread. This restricts the dataset to a size that can still be analysed by means of close reading and also constrains the comments to relate, even if only peripherally, to the one question or topic that initiated the discussion thread.</p>
<p>A common phenomenon in discussions in general is that the sub-questions emerge and that the focus of the topics shifts to new content. This illustrates that a technique is needed that can zoom in from the whole-thread level to prevalent topics that group the single posts into content categories. These single posts, on the other hand, can not only be members of topical (content) groups, but also point towards groups related to discourse function in Reddit discussions <sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The hierarchical structure of Reddit discussions, ranging from single comments to a whole thread, matches our goal to contrast low-level close reading with high-level distant reading. For a scholarly reading of a discussion forum, neither isolated comments nor a high level view on the discussion thread as a whole are sufficient. Scholars need to know about topical groupings that provide a frame of reference for single comments. While grouping of comments can be achieved by manual labeling, a distant reading approach is promising as a method that is faster, that in principle scales up to larger discussion threads, and that may remove some human biases during the annotation process.</p>
<p>Yet, the role of irony, emotion, and humor in this thread warrants a close reading approach. The pervasiveness of irony and ironic detachment in contemporary (online) culture has been described by Ian Bogost as the    “escape from having to choose between earnestness and disdain,”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  . Poe’s Law, an adage of Internet culture, states that online, it’s impossible to know who’s joking and who’s being serious. In  <em>The Ambivalent Internet</em>  (2017), Whitney Phillips and Ryan Milner show how digital communications, e.g., through GIFs, memes, and videos, are operationalized to fundamentally destabilize the worldviews of others. It is almost impossible to determine when an ironic posture is adopted. Humor, irony, and role playing are central to the behaviors in online environments and communities like those on reddit. A manual annotation is to be expected to detect more of this humor and irony than a topic model. Therefore, we have chosen to call the level of human annotation close reading, which traditionally attends to tone and style as well as content of the message.</p>
<h2 id="close-reading-1">Close reading</h2>
<p>While the initial question of the Reddit thread regards viewpoints on the pros and cons of a future celebrity president and the names of potential Democrat candidates, the thread soon developed into a more complex conversation in which different  “new”  questions were discussed as well. In order to grasp these associative developments inside the discussion and the mechanics of a forum like Reddit, we choose to employ a hypothesis-free form of close reading, which means we first started looking for patterns in the material of the discussion in a rather open-ended way, without explicitly framing our horizon of expectation, or what we were expecting to find, beforehand. We chose this approach since our aim was first and foremost to comparatively analyze methodologies, and only secondarily, to find an answer to the question posed in the thread, regarding celebrities in politics.</p>
<p>This process took place in a bottom-up fashion: two human annotators analyzed the posts in the thread, and chose a word or phrase to summarize each post. During this process, they developed a collection of labels that were assigned to the posts. Based on this reading, fifteen classes of posts were identified and color-coded based on the classes. Ten of them turned out to be related to three different underlying questions that we formulated based on the classes. We describe these at more length under  “report of the close reading analysis” . After manually annotating the 449 posts separately, we compared the lists of the outcome and slightly modified the categories to accommodate both our findings. Upon comparison, we discovered there was a high degree of congruence between the categories assigned to the posts in both annotations.</p>
<h2 id="distant-reading-1">Distant reading</h2>
<p>Parallel to the close reading based, manual annotations, we approach the Reddit thread from a distant reading perspective. Specifically, we adopt a data-driven ideal of distant reading, i.e. we want to start analysing without any human insight into the textual dataset. This results in two requirements on a distant reading method: First, the approach needs to be unsupervised, i.e. not relying on any prior labeling of the data. Second, the fact that Reddit threads are open-ended in the topics they comprise, the number of topics in the shape of clusters resulting from the distant reading algorithm needs to be variable. At least, there needs to be a possibility to model a range of clusters in a computationally feasible manner. These two requirements can be understood as equivalent to the hypothesis-free aspects (of the close reading approach) in our distant reading method.</p>
<p>One technique that fulfills both requirements is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. This method allows for the automatic grouping of text documents according to latent content categories. These topics underlying a text corpus are modelled in a completely unsupervised manner, meaning that the algorithm does not know which texts belong together (for example, according to some human labeling) beforehand. This aspect of unsupervised LDA thus serves a data-driven ideal of distant reading. For each topic, LDA creates a different language model, as the underlying assumption is that different topics require different words and constructions. In our research, we expect that LDA is suitable as texts with different topics are expected to use a different  “language” .</p>
<p>Importantly, the number of topics resulting from LDA is a parameter that is set manually by the user. While determining an adequate number of topics for a dataset is often a problematic challenge for which no definite solutions are agreed on, the variability of the resulting number of cluster matches the second requirement to our desired distant reading technique. Because it is unknown how many topics are to be expected from a discussion thread, a pass through a range of numbers of LDA topics is necessary. Investigating a whole range of numbers of topics may additionally reveal several different levels of topical granularity that can be captured using LDA.</p>
<p>LDA has already been used for text analysis in the area of Digital Humanities. For example, Emmery and van Zaanen (2015) investigated the application of LDA to identify changes in the number of comments on news articles on the topic of online security before and after the Snowden revelation in 2013.</p>
<p>Lastly, we choose LDA as counterpart to close reading, since both approaches focus on content of the texts (posts within the Reddit thread). We strengthen this perspective by removing stop words (which are mostly function words) from the textual data, before modeling topics with LDA.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, deciding on the optimal number of topics to be modeled is problematic. In the case of a Reddit thread, new topics unfold as the discussion proceeds, which means that the number of topics depends on the size of the Reddit thread. It is therefore difficult to make an informed decision about the number of topics for an LDA model, based on manual inspection of comments alone. To resolve this problem, we propose a possibility to determine an adequate number of topics for a set of already present manual annotations.</p>
<p>During the annotation process, each post (the original thread submission question or a comment on it) in the Reddit thread is treated as a separate document (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>, left). For each document, the LDA topic with the highest probability is selected. This is certainly a limiting decision, but we find that the per-document probability distributions usually strongly favor one single topic with a very high probability, while the probabilities for the other topics are close to zero.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-of-the-approaches">Comparison of the approaches</h2>
<p>After analyzing the documents, they are thus represented by two labels, one from two distinct sets of annotations each: a close reading annotation and a (single) LDA topic. Based on this information, we now aim to identify LDA topics and manual annotations that express similar concepts. Going through the list of documents, co-occurrences of the two annotations are counted in a matrix (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>, right, LDA topics in columns, manual annotation classes in rows).</p>

<p>Given the co-occurrence matrix, the aim is to find, for each LDA topic, the manual annotation class that is best represented by the topic. In order to do so, the matrix is passed columnwise, and the manual annotation class in the row with the highest count is selected as corresponding best to the LDA class of that column. At this point we introduce an optional step of normalisation, applied on the co-occurrence matrix (<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). Collecting absolute counts in the matrix may give an unfair advantage to annotation tags with high class support. During normalisation, the counts are divided by the class support of the manual annotation class of this row, resulting in fractions instead of absolute numbers. The steps described in the rest of this article always make use of both the absolute counts and the normalised counts matrix separately.</p>

<p>Using the mapping, the LDA classes are translated into manual annotation classes (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>).

In the original list of documents, each document is now represented by two annotations that are drawn from one  <em>common</em>  pool of possible annotations. In machine learning terms, the manual annotations are treated as gold standard (or true labels) and the mapped LDA classes are regarded as predictions. To measure the extent to which the predictions and the gold standard overlap, we calculate the accuracy.</p>

<p>For a single topic model, we have now obtained a measure of overlap between close reading based, manual annotations and distant reading LDA topics. In order to find the optimal topic model, several topic models with varying numbers of topics can be computed and the overlap accuracy can be compared. For the present study, we produced topic models with a number of topics ranging from 1 topic to  <em>N</em>  topics, with an  <em>N</em>  equal to the number of documents in the collection. We expect a topic model with as many topics as are documents in the corpus to be of low expressive power. Similarly, a topic model with only one LDA class cannot adequately express several manual annotation classes.</p>
<p>For the Reddit thread on the question  <em>Should the Democrats nominate a celebrity in 2020? What would be the pros and cons?</em> , overlap accuracy is calculated for LDA models with 1 to 461 topics. The topic model with the best fit to the manual annotations is defined as the topic model corresponding to the highest accuracy value.</p>
<p>Note that increasing the number of LDA topics leads to a higher likelihood of high accuracy. Imagine the situation in which each document receives a unique LDA class. This allows for a perfect accuracy, but the predictive power is extremely low as no document is comparable according to the LDA classes. To resolve this issue, a second possibility to determine the optimal number of topics is also investigated. Here, we reverse the mapping step and transform manual classes to LDA classes. The steps described above stay the same, except the co-occurrence matrix is passed row-wise instead of column-wise<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> .</p>
<p>As seen in the results, both the forward mapping and the reverse mapping result in a perfect solution: Mapping LDA classes to manual classes leads to increasingly high accuracy with an increasing number of topics. Mapping manual classes to LDA classes, in turn, leads to complete overlap for a single LDA class, because all manual classes are correctly mapped to that single LDA class. The maximum accuracy values in the two scenarios are misleading because neither having a single LDA topic nor having hundreds is useful for the purpose of distant reading. In our approach we exploit this phenomenon by aiming for the right balance between the two perfect solutions. We do so by calculating the absolute difference between forward and reverse accuracy for each number of topics. Subsequently, we select the number of topics with the lowest absolute difference in the accuracies from the forward and reverse mapping.</p>

<p>Based on the close reading strategy described above, we identify fifteen classes of posts (<a href="#table01">Table 1</a>). Ten of them are related to three different underlying questions that we formulate based on the classes:  <em>What characteristics should a president have in order to be a good leader?</em>  (Red, class 1-3),  <em>Which parties could influence the likeability of a potential president?</em>  (Green, class 4-5),  <em>In which political climate and context is the question discussed?</em>  (Blue, class 6-10). The other five are classified as actions that are divided over two groups, hyperlinks to other sources (Yellow, class 11-12) and (self-)referential comments/responses (Purple, class 13-15).<br>

<p>By assigning colors to the classes that relate to the same question or action, we can distinguish the variety of discussions inside one subreddit and see how these discussions develop throughout the thread (<a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>). From left to right, the first 130 comments mostly discuss the political climate (Blue) (e.g.,  _ Democrats didn’t show up. Republican turnout fairly steady. _  (post 63)). These comments seem to create a context for the discussion as a whole. Thereafter, the characteristics of an ideal president are discussed (Red) (e.g.,  _ I say charisma goes a long way, part of being president is to inspire people. Dems should go young and the candidate should be well spoken (Obama) and inspiring. Leave the dynasties, get someone younger, inspire people to come out and vote for them. _  (post 120)). Near the end, the influence of media and celebrity culture are set against the former discussions (Green) (e.g.,  _ Do you think he would’ve won the popular vote if not for that video _  (post 17)). The  “actions”  of hyperlinking (Yellow), joking (e.g.,  _ We’ll get him a box. Worked for Napoleon. _  (post 239)) and (emotional) responding (e.g.,  _ I’ll concede that that’s an excellent point. _  (post 57)) (Purple) occur equally frequent throughout the whole subreddit. The variety of questions discussed in the subreddit does not seem to occur randomly, but in clusters: We can see a certain development in how the colors follow each other up.</p>

<p>Following application of the LDA topic modeling technique and the process to assign LDA topics to manual topics, we measure the overlap between manual and computational annotation. Accuracy measures are obtained for a varying number of topics in the LDA model. <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a> plots the overlap accuracy over the number of topics. It can be observed that the accuracy keeps increasing with higher numbers of topics in the LDA models. The reason for this is, that with more LDA topics, more and more topics get assigned to only one document. During the mapping, the single occurrence of an LDA class is necessarily converted to the correct manual annotation class. This creates the aforementioned perfect solution to the mapping problem. However, the model with the highest overlap accuracy has low generalising power. Such a detailed topic model moves away from the desired distant reading perspective, which would group the comments into a limited set of categories.</p>

<p>To evaluate how well the LDA model overlaps with the manual annotations it is of fundamental importance to compare the performance against a baseline. As baseline we use a random assignment of the manual annotations to the documents. We explicitly decide not to make use of another common baseline, the majority class baseline. The reason for this is that we aim to cover all classes instead of just a single one and random assignment better reflects this goal. The random assignment labels are then compared to the actual manual assignment. This process is bootstrapped and averaged over 1000 trials. The accuracy measures derived from the random assignment and the LDA topic models are presented in <a href="#table02">Table 2</a>. Regardless of whether the co-occurrence matrix is normalised for class support the LDA classes lead to a higher overlap with the manual annotations than the random assignment. The overlap between the LDA classes and the manual annotations is thus above chance level. Comparing the non-normalised model to the normalised model it can be observed that normalisation increases recall by covering relatively many manual classes to the mapping even when a small number of topics is modeled.</p>
<p>For the Reddit thread case study, the described process results in a topic model with 6 topics that has the highest overlap with the gold standard annotations. However, the measures based on absolute counts are still strongly biased towards the majority class. Since we intend to cover all classes as well as possible, the accuracy based on absolute counts is too optimistic for our purpose. The corresponding model using normalised counts may better generalise to all classes. According to the model normalised for class support, 23 topics best represent the manual annotation.<br>
Baseline accuracy (random assignment) and maximum accuracies based on the proposed overlap measures with their corresponding number of topics.      Accuracy  Number of Topics      Baseline  (Random Assignment)  6.03%  -      Forward + Reverse (absolute counts matrix)  29.17%  6      Forward + Reverse (normalised counts matrix)  13.01%  23</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The manual annotation revealed that we did not only identify several opinions or find information that regards the question that the thread set out from; in addition, we found another class of posts that we choose to describe along the lines of  <em>discourse function</em> : for instance, humor, hyperlinks, or direct responses (e.g., yes, no, indeed). These are elements that fulfill a certain function within the larger collective discourse, without being reducible to an answer to the main question, an opinion or a piece of information. The posts that fall within the function classes do not correspond to specific topics, so it is likely that these elements can only be identified by close reading. In particular, posts that deal with humor and irony are hard to identify computationally, which underlines the importance of human annotation. The bottom-up process of manual annotation and our hypothesis-free form of close reading unraveled underlying questions and contexts that we can use to aid computational strategy.</p>
<p>The manual annotation (close reading), as made visible by the color coding, seems to point to an associative structure between the comments. So far, our close reading approach regards the posts in a linear (chronological) order, while our distant reading methodology regards the posts without any order or structure. However, Reddit also organizes posts in hierarchical structure. What further differentiates Reddit from a real-time information network like Twitter is that the community curates the stream of content themselves. Items that they consider to be of value are  “upvoted” , and those deemed unworthy are  “downvoted” . This way the position of root comments within one single thread, i.e., comments that directly reply to the original submission, is determined by Reddit’s voting system. We did not investigate this in the current research, but it will certainly influence the required reading strategy for this specific environment. Note that the current distant reading approach cannot easily incorporate the inherent hierarchical information of the dataset.</p>
<p>By supplementing our close reading with a distant reading methodology, we can give the reader an overview of the relations between the discussions. The idea of studying the hierarchical structure, which with the present method remains un(der)explored, will be the next step in our research. Examining this hierarchical structure as an extra dimension is necessary in order to come to a more comprehensive take on the information we encounter on this online platform.</p>
<p>Second, there is a problem with the hypothesis-free approach, as employed in our study. A predetermined research question aids in keeping the set of close reading annotation types controlled, i.e., a small number of unique topics as well as topics that stay within concise conceptual borders. Still, there are many questions on the close reading side, leading to different collections of close reading classes and we need to determine which of those correspond to the identified distant reading classes. In other words, it is as of yet unclear how generalizable this approach is.</p>
<p>We have proposed a way to find a mapping from LDA to manually assigned classes. The analysis of the close and distant reading demonstrates that LDA is indeed a possibility to generate a computational model of close reading annotations. However it needs to be clearly stated that the overlap between the two sets of labels, as measured by accuracy, is relatively low. This may, first, be due to the rather high number of 15 classes of comments on a relatively small dataset (461 comments). Second, some of the close reading based classes describe function rather than content. LDA topic modeling is designed to primarily capture content information and may thus not be able to accurately capture functional classes.</p>
<p>Still, the proposed approach leads to an overlap above chance level and future work should try to further increase the overlap. If we can find an LDA model that overlaps well with a set of annotations it is possible to generalise from the LDA model to new, unseen data. From this point on, less manual annotation would be needed, which would benefit the literary analysis by extending the size of the data. Conclusions can then be drawn on the grounds of a larger dataset.</p>
<p>Finally, the research was carried out by a diverse group of researchers, both from a computational and a cultural studies background. The interdisciplinary character of the research group is essential for this type of research, but also introduces challenges. The terminology used in the two fields is not exactly the same, which leads to a confusion of tongues. For example, clustering texts is not the same as close reading, even though the resulting information may be used as the basis for close reading. Furthermore, close reading entails much more than human annotation of text samples. We believe that for a successful application of distant reading approaches in a close reading context, this language or terminology boundary between the disciplines needs to be crossed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have argued that close and distant reading, from the beginning of the latter, have gone hand in hand, other than Moretti’s polemic introduction to the topic would suggest. Studies that use distant reading methods and combine it with close reading most often follow the information seeking mantra or top down approach (overview first, zoom &amp; filter, details on demand). As an alternative, we presented a study in which we used manual annotation not as a sample that follows from the overview produced by the distant reading, but a method that comes before, or runs parallel to, the LDA analyses, to evaluate its workings and to reflect on its strengths and weaknesses. We used close reading of posts and manual annotation to fill in the gaps, to evaluate and to reflect upon the LDA distant reading.</p>
<p>We see that close reading may reveal interesting detailed knowledge that distant reading may not find, while distant reading allows for the identification of large-scale patterns by analyzing vast collections of text that cannot be seen when only analyzing small amounts. Reading the same corpora at different scales using differently tuned digital instruments can then be more illuminating than either close or distant reading of their own accord.</p>
<p>Close reading digs for complexity, opacity, irony, and ambiguity: values that stand to be reappraised in a time when we encounter vast bodies of information through multiple platforms, and when, moreover, we tend to overemphasize transparency and immediacy when processing this information. Even though we live in a time that tends to privilege the  “full picture”  and distrust sampling, we contend with Johanna Drucker that meaning-making is precisely based on editing, focus, and finitude:    “Editing towards meaning is a fundamental skill of human survival, through the selection of pertinent information, which accumulates in a significant pattern”   <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  . Yet, another indispensable skill in a time of information overload is the ability to skim, to filter out, and to ignore the inessential.</p>
<p>Therefore, we undertook a first, explorative step in this paper towards a mixed methodology where the input of a close reading drives the analysis of the distant reading: an analysis that incorporates local annotation in a  “distant”  analysis. We have investigated and evaluated the use of the content-oriented LDA technique to identify clusters of texts in a way that simulates a close reading approach. Automatic analysis allows for a motivated selection of documents that should be considered for a deeper close reading analysis. Regarding distant reading methodologies, we find that our current approach that relies on LDA topic modeling cannot fully replace manual annotations altogether. Still, it may be valuable to extend from already present manual annotations. Future work will focus on human-in-the-loop approaches, such as labeled LDA <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>, which can steer the clustering method based on prior human-proposed knowledge. LDA topic modeling could then be used to find content-based clusters with a higher density of keywords, questions, and topics. Once clustered, the groups can be submitted to a closer (close reading) analysis. Our further research will explore and evaluate this possibility for Reddit discussions.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The task of the modern editor often starts with a digital recording of the contents of original documents written on a variety of physical media. If produced by a machine, such as a printing press, text presents itself for encoding as a sequence of characters arranged into evenly spaced lines contained in one or more columns per page. In practice, though, even the printed text of a single document will contain many errors: obvious misspellings, gaps, duplicated words, misprints etc. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Depending on its age it may also contain ligatures and abbreviations whose expansion into more modern forms may seem necessary to its editor <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The corrected and expanded text thus represents another version of what seemed at first glance to be easily representable via a simple sequence of character codes.</p>
<p>Another class of documents that contain hidden internal variation is the professionally produced medieval manuscript. Trained scribes worked in scriptoria to laboriously copy out each line neatly for reading. Although they were careful, mistakes were common. Haplography or dittography are two well-known types (where material was inadvertently left out or added). Incorporating readings from a second exemplar when the first one was deficient, corrections by a second hand and of course numerous ligatures are just some of the textual phenomena that complicate the transcription process <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A further type of document containing internal variants is the modern holograph manuscript revised by its author. Since in most cases the changes are in the same hand and ink-colour, it may be difficult to discern a clear sequence of revisions. The writer may have tinkered with the text over an extended period of time. The result may not be entirely legible, but even if it is, unravelling the sequence of script-acts that created it is usually conjectural <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To transcribe each text fully, no matter its provenance, thus requires some way to represent textual variation both within the document and also between documents: original and successive manuscript drafts, fair copies and, for printed works, typescripts and proofs, first and later editions.</p>
<p>There is still no satisfactory commercial solution to these two linked problems, and even if there were, any tools would necessarily be subject to the commercial software lifecycle, which for major products is estimated to last around 8–12 years <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Although open source software is immune to some of its effects, it is still subject to platform and media obsolescence, that is, to the obsolescence of dependent services and tools <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This situation is not at all what humanists want. Ideally, they would like digital texts and the software that goes with them to have the same stability as printed books.</p>
<p>Our libraries are replete with manuscripts. For example, the National Library of Australia has 16 kilometres of shelf space dedicated to manuscripts <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, and other large libraries have similar holdings. What is to become of even the smallest proportion of this material deemed worthy to be digitised one day, not as hard-to-read image files, but with their contents transcribed for editorial purposes and sophisticated end-use? Will they have to be remade every 10–20 years because technology has moved on? In that case the cost alone of maintaining existing transcriptions and software is likely to consume all available resources. By contrast, the shelf life of the printed book extends back to its inception in the 15th century. Anyone who has handled an incunable will marvel at the quality of the paper, the clarity (if antiquated appearance) of its type. How can our digital texts even begin to approach this kind of longevity?</p>
<p>The problem reduces to this: any technology beyond the most common and stable variety is doomed to become obsolete within its normal lifecycle of around 10–20 years. Beyond the mere recording of data, customised computer programs required to manipulate and present the textual data will become obsolete even sooner without constant maintenance. Continuously seeking after a supposedly final technology that will immortalise new editorial work is thus unlikely to succeed. In practice, change is constant, and may come so fast that the chosen technology becomes obsolete even before an editorial project ends <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Is there any answer to this problem, or is it simply the natural property of digital text and the software needed to manipulate it that renders both ephemeral? Fortunately, certain digital technologies seem to endure far longer than others. For example, the Unicode standard arose by incorporating earlier smaller character encoding standards like ASCII (1963) then ISO-8859-1 (1987), culminating in the Unicode standard itself (1991). To change the assignation of letters to codes in this basic character set would invalidate billions of texts worldwide for no overall benefit. So it is not far-fetched to suppose that in, say, 100 years time, a digital file containing nothing but Unicode character codes will continue to be readable.</p>
<p>Accordingly, what is proposed here is a simple use of the most basic and stable digital technologies to encode the contents of complex historical documents. If the approach is successful, any software of current or future design would then be able to manipulate those documents into useful forms. The guiding idea is that the less technology we put into our digitally recorded texts the more useful and durable they will be in the future.</p>
<p>This proposal has nothing to do either with the technology used to manipulate encoded texts, or with the editorial method for creating them. It is orthogonal to both; and is, rather, a simple but effective strategy for recording transcriptions of complex original documents in digital form. To explain how this works in practice, the second section below develops a model of versions and layers through a series of real-world examples. The third and fourth sections then describe the advantages and disadvantages of this rearrangement of digital textual data as it relates to the scholarly edition. Finally, the fifth section explains in abstract terms how these texts can be used to make digital scholarly editions.</p>
<h2 id="2-a-model-of-versions-and-layers">2. A model of versions and layers</h2>
<p>This model of versions and layers originally developed out of the author’s own work on the manuscripts of Ludwig Wittgenstein <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. It is most closely related to what Hans Walter Gabler calls the  “German school of editorial scholarship” , including the historical-critical edition, in which the  “critical”  component referred not so much to the establishment of the text but to the analysis or critique of the text’s genesis and history <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Gabler perhaps coined the term layers in his 1986 edition of Ulysses <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> although the concept seems to apply only to levels of local revision. The same concept was taken over into the HyperNietzsche Markup Language <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. A similar approach is also taken in genetic editions like Dietrich Sattler’s Hölderlin, where the apparatus is placed inline by graphically arranging variants above the line of text they pertain to. As Sattler says, this results in a text where the variants are readable in their true context, not removed to a distant apparatus <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. The concept is basically the same here, except that it has been translated from the printed page into a simple arrangement of plain-text files.</p>
<p>Out of the three classes of texts described in the introduction: printed books, medieval manuscript copies of earlier texts and modern holographs, the examples explored below use mostly the third category. This is because the model pertains to the process of writing itself, not to a particular text-type. Holographs were chosen because they typically exhibit higher levels of internal variation than the other two, and for the model to be universal it has to cater for the worst-case scenario. This is not meant to imply that the three classes of text are equivalent, except in so far as they all represent the phenomena of writing or printing on paper, parchment or other physical surfaces.</p>
<p>The examples are mostly taken from the manuscripts of the Australian poet Charles Harpur (1813-1868). The Charles Harpur Critical Archive <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> has obtained permission from their owner, the State Library of New South Wales, to publish the images and content of all Harpur-related material in its possession. Also, thanks to recent changes in Australian copyright law, from 2019 unpublished manuscripts will have the same copyright duration — 70 years after the death of the author — as printed works <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. So these texts form a very useful set of freely available examples from which to develop the model described here. They are also very varied in nature, consisting of newspaper cuttings, printed pamphlets and books, drafts of corrected manuscripts and letters. As will be demonstrated below, only a very small number of basic editing operations on handwritten texts are needed to put the proposed model of versions and layers into practice. The focus on Harpur does not introduce a bias because all the textual phenomena being explored here <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  are common to virtually all handwritten texts, and examples of each phenomenon have been verified as also existing in the manuscripts of Melville’s  <em>Typee</em>   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, Wittgenstein <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>, Samuel Beckett <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, the Faust Edition <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and the Shelley-Godwin Archive <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. The markup schema described in the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines Chapter 11  “Transcription of Primary Sources”  provides higher-level or finer grained descriptions of these same basic textual phenomena <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.

<p>Figure 1 shows one stanza taken from Harpur’s poem  “Vestibulary Stanzas”  in manuscript B78 written in 1855 <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. Seven changes can be discerned:</p>
<p>line 2: the transposition of is strung and too high</p>
<p>line 2: the replacement of the entire line by line 1</p>
<p>line 4: the replacement of thy by his</p>
<p>line 4: the replacement of I do mark in by all may guess from</p>
<p>line 4: the replacement of beaming eye by fervent tongue</p>
<p>line 5: the replacement of blaze by fire</p>
<p>line 5: the replacement of The inward rolling fire by How burns the fire within</p>
<p>The temporal order of these changes can be determined in only two cases. It is clear that the transposition in line 2 preceded its replacement by line 1. Also the replacement of blaze by fire in line 5 preceded the replacement of The inward rolling fire by How burns the fire within. Other than these inferences, the exact sequence of changes here is unrecoverable. For instance, it is not clear if the poet changed line 2 before lines 4 and 5. All remaining changes have thus to be treated as independent of one another.</p>
<p>Some definitions may now be put forward:</p>
<p><strong>Definition 1:</strong>  A change is independent if it can be carried out without affecting the sense, grammar or metre of the rest of the text.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 2:</strong>  A state is a hypothetical or actual reading of part of the text before or after one or more independent changes have been carried out or not. <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>
<p>For example, line 4 may have once been in any of the following states:</p>
<p>And I do mark in thy too beaming eye  And I do mark in thy too fervent tongue  And I do mark in his too beaming eye  And I do mark in his too fervent tongue  And all may guess from thy too beaming eye  And all may guess from thy too fervent tongue  And all may guess from his too beaming eye  And all may guess from his too fervent tongue</p>
<p>All possibilities are equally valid here, but the final state of the entire line is clearly  “And all may guess from his too fervent tongue” .</p>
<p>Also, following Bryant’s terminology, we offer:</p>
<p><strong>Definition 3:</strong>  A revision site is a hot-spot  <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> or cluster of dependent changes at some point in the text-stream.</p>
<p>In Figure 2 the substitutions and deletions the/his, whereon they/on which his spirit, to burn, the/some, to burn and , are revision-sites. Changes that are local to one revision-site are less likely to be connected with changes elsewhere in the same manuscript the further apart they are. A change at the start of a document is very probably (although not certainly) unrelated to a change at its end. Even changes in the same stanza, as in the example above, are more likely to be unrelated than related.</p>
<p>Figure 2, from the same manuscript <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, is an example where several changes are related by grammar and sense.</p>

<p>The two layers here are:<br>
1:  (Each in the age, whereon they rose  To burn, like the peculiar stars of night,  Eternally apart, — )  2:  (Each in his age, on which his spirit rose  like some peculiar star of night,  To burn Eternally apart — )<br>
The substitutions: whereon they by on which his spirit and stars by star are related by grammar, and were presumably carried out at the same time, not independently — the plural stars according with they and not his. Similarly, the deletion of To burn and its reinsertion on the final line are related by sense. However, each of these two sets of changes taken as a whole is independent of the other, and thus acts as a single independent change.</p>
<p>This independency of individual or grouped dependent changes has an unfortunate mathematical consequence for storage. Each independent change consists of at least two states (carried out or not), so over the entire document the number of possible texts obtainable will be at least 2×2&hellip;or 2N, where N is the total number of independent changes. In the single stanza in Figure 1, as described above, there were 3 independent changes and two pairs of temporally dependent changes, each having 3 states, for a total of 23 ×32 = 72 possible texts. Over an entire document the total number of possible texts will be exponentially large. For just 100 independent changes we have 2100 or approximately 1.267 × 1030 possible texts or 1267 with 27 zeroes after it. Many documents will contain far more changes than that. So any attempt to store all possible states of a document’s contents in this exhaustive fashion is bound to fail.</p>
<h2 id="21-layers">2.1 Layers</h2>
<p>As already noted, the changes in lines 2 and 5 in Figure 1 are related in time. In certain texts there may be temporal sequences of up to 10 or more local substitutions, as in the Magrelli poem  “La campagna Romana”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Each change belongs to a local point in time or level, and the state of the text at each stage includes the context that surrounds it. Since it is not possible to record all local states separately in their version-wide contexts (because they are exponentially too many) a simple solution is to assign all changes in the document occurring at the same position in the  <em>local</em>  temporal sequence to the  <em>same</em>  numbered layer.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 4:</strong>  A layer is a tracing of the documentary text from start to finish that includes all the changes in each revision-site at a given level, the unchanged text that lies between them and the final state of other revision-sites that end at a lower level.</p>
<p>So instead of 72 layers for this stanza — the total number of possible combinations of independent changes — only three are needed: the initial state of each segment of text that undergoes change and its subsequent states. For example, line 2 admits of three such states:</p>
<p>1: Ah Poet! thy young heart is strung too high  2: Ah Poet! thy young heart too high is strung  3: But ah! too high his harp-like heart is strung</p>
<p>Thus, to record the stanza’s text in its entirety requires only three layers. The unrelated changes noted above require only 2 layers each, and line 5 requires 3. If all the local states at a particular level are merged into one layer, then each layer becomes a  <em>record</em>  of the local states of change. Layer-1 would be the text as it was originally throughout. Layer-2 is its state after the first local change, and Layer-3 or Layer-final its state after a second local change. This makes no claim that Layer-1 or Layer-2 ever existed as a version-wide text: more on this, below. It is merely a way of recording and storing all of the text of this complex document using only the technology needed to record unchanged text. For clarity, here are all the layers of Figure 1 written out in full:</p>
<h1 id="layer-1">Layer-1</h1>
<p>Ah Poet! thy young heart is strung too high  To bear the jars of this harsh world’s estate!  And I do mark in thy too beaming eye  The inward rolling blaze that bodes a wayward fate.</p>
<h1 id="layer-2">Layer-2</h1>
<p>Ah Poet! thy young heart too high is strung  To bear the jars of this harsh world’s estate!  And all may guess from his too fervent tongue  The inward rolling fire that bodes a wayward fate.</p>
<h1 id="layer-final">Layer-final</h1>
<p>But ah! too high his harp-like heart is strung  To bear the jars of this harsh world’s estate!  And all may guess from his too fervent tongue  How burns the fire within that bodes a wayward fate.</p>
<p>An obvious objection here is that the author almost certainly never wrote layers 1 and 2. Mathematically, the chances that he did so in this case are just 1 in 72. However, so long as it is remembered that the only layer that ought to be considered a  “version”  is Layer-final, the objection is moot. Layers are merely a mechanism to record local changes,  <em>not</em>  a record of how the scribe or author wrote the document as a whole. They do not constitute an ontological claim. So long as it is remembered which transcriptions are layers, and which can be considered versions, no confusion should arise.</p>
<h2 id="22-deletion-insertion-substitution-and-transposition">2.2 Deletion, insertion, substitution and transposition</h2>
<p>The key advantage — the true efficiency — of layers is that they do away with the need to explicitly record deletions, insertions, substitutions and transpositions. Any text present in one layer and absent from a subsequent layer can be assumed to be deleted. Likewise any text that appears in a subsequent layer, where it was previously absent, is an insertion. Text that is replaced by other text at the same location in a subsequent layer can be regarded as substituted. Similarly, text that appears transposed in a later layer can be considered transposed. On the other hand, using current encoding techniques, text must be manually labelled as deleted, inserted, substituted or transposed using explicitly entered, complex markup codes <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. This considerable human effort is not needed if it can instead be undertaken by a computer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by marking the text as deleted or inserted etc., current digital encoding practice conflates the membership of an internal variant in a particular layer with its graphical status, in effect declaring that deleted text is in a crossed-out format, just as, say, underlining is a format. But, unlike underlining, crossed-out text is also replaced, perhaps by nothing (a deletion) or by something else (a substitution). That these two operations — the assignment of a format and the substitution — are separate and distinguishable is proven by the case of open variants, where the earlier version of the text is not crossed-out <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An example in Harpur can be found in  “The Bard of Paradise”   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Harpur first wrote speckless before squeezing in gleaming above it. But speckless is not crossed-out and the added pair of brackets indicates that the author considered them both viable alternatives that, in this manuscript, he did not go on to resolve. For the proposed layering approach the usual assumption that text in an earlier layer is deleted may be resolved via markup. By this means the earlier variant can be labelled as undeleted without overly complicating the encoding of the layer itself. As we have seen, the layering approach is justified by its efficiency: even in the very uncommon case of open variants when markup cannot be avoided considerable savings in coding can nevertheless be realised.</p>
<h2 id="23-versions">2.3 Versions</h2>
<p>Although the term version has been used variously by scholarly editors, the definition proposed here is practical and simple:</p>
<p><strong>Definition 5:</strong>  A version is a single document-wide state of the text, determinable with reasonable certainty, in which the author or scribe completed or abandoned the entire documentary text at some point in time.</p>
<p>Although in most holographs the only determinable version is the final layer or state of a manuscript, in some cases an individual manuscript may be witness to more than one version. This section describes some examples of this.</p>
<p>Harpur’s first draft of his sonnet  “Trust in God”  was written on the inside back cover of a copy of his 1853 book  <em>The Bushrangers</em>   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. He then redrafted it on the inside front cover. Figure 4 shows this latter text, which is mostly written in a dark-coloured ink with some corrections in lighter ink. Disregarding the lighter corrections, the final layer of the dark-ink version corresponds closely to the copy published in the  <em>Empire</em>  newspaper of 20 June 1853 as shown in Figure 5 <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. A subsequent publication in the  <em>Australian Home Companion</em>  of 1859 (Figure 6) accords with the state of the text after the final corrections in lighter ink, with some changes to the pentultimate line <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. It can thus be seen that this manuscript contains two discernable document-wide states of the text – two versions – each of which has its own local corrections or layers.</p>

<p>Professionally produced manuscripts may contain similar internal versions.

<p>The baseline text A was revised in three distinct hands A1, A2 and A3. A1 is probably the scribe himself, fixing simple mistakes of spelling. A2 is probably a different but contemporary hand in which titles are added in the margins. A3 is a Roman cursive hand of the second century or later <sup id="fnref2:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. So A1 is probably a layer of the first version, while A2 and A3 form two new versions, which subsume the final corrected texts of A1 and A2 respectively. In Figure 7 the three lines inserted at the top are by A3 (a faint marginal mark inserts them before line 6), the title in the left margin ΙΩ ΑΘΗΝΑΙΟΙΣ was added by A2 and the correction of ΧΑΛΚΕΝΤΥΠΟΥ to ΧΑΛΚΕΟΤΥΠΟΥ in line 7 was by A1.</p>
<p>Bryant likewise sees three internal versions in Melville’s  <em>Typee</em>  manuscript, which he calls  “transcription, transformation, and translation”   <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Van Hulle and Neyt call internal versions  “revision campaigns”  when they can be reliably distinguished by a new writing instrument or change of ink <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, in the absence of such information about discernible pens or differences in handwriting or style most holographs contain only one version. It is up to the human editor to decide whether a correction belongs to a specific layer or version.</p>
<h2 id="3-advantages-of-versions-and-layers">3. Advantages of versions and layers</h2>
<p>This model of versions and layers has certain advantages. These can be appreciated through a comparison of the versions and layers model with the current method of recording variants in manuscripts using inline embedded markup.</p>
<h2 id="31-problems-with-embedded-markup">3.1 Problems with embedded markup</h2>
<p>In the embedded markup method variants within a document are inserted directly into the text-stream wherever the transcriber encounters a revision-site.</p>
<p>Many markup languages have been proposed that adopt an embedded or inline approach to recording variants. (In what follows the terms inline and embedded are used interchangeably.) One of the earliest was MECS (multi-element encoding system), which evolved from the Wittgenstein markup developed at Tübingen in the 1970s <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. The same technique was later used in the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) Guidelines, and in many ad hoc markup systems developed for individual editions, such as the Tagore Bichitra <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. In order to illustrate the disadvantages of inline recording of variants, a simple hypothetical markup language may be used that maintains the generality of the argument, while ensuring clarity, without reference to any specific system of markup. The language is defined by four rules:</p>
<p>Deletions are enclosed in [ and ].  Insertions are enclosed in &lt; and &gt;.  Insertions and deletions may nest: inner ones are earlier than those on the outside.  Insertions and deletions that immediately follow one another with no intervening spaces indicate a temporal succession from left to right.</p>
<p>Although they may use different syntaxes these simple rules are followed by all markup languages that are used to record inline variants. For example, the text of Figure 1 could be transcribed in this markup language as follows:<br>
[Ah, Poet! thy young [heart is strung too high]<too high is strung>]&lt;But ah! too high his harp-like heart is strung&gt;  To bear the jars of this harsh world’s estate!  And [I do mark in]<all may guess from> [thy]<his> too [beaming eye]<fervent tongue>  [[The inward rolling][blaze]<fire>]<How burns the fire within> that bodes a wayward fate. <br>
The presence of the embedded variants here makes it difficult for a human editor to see in what state the text was at any stage in its revision, and requires him or her to visualise a complex series of steps using abstract symbols. The heavier the corrections the harder this task becomes. Occasionally our trained Harpur transcribers would even decline to encode Harpur’s more complex passages. For instance, one noted:  “Lines 15 and 31 contain numerous additions and deletions; only the final intentions have been transcribed here.”</p>
<p>Searching will also be impaired, since the inline variants interfere with the retrieval of literal expressions. Search engines typically don’t see the markup. All they see is the text in the nonsensical word-order given above. As a result, searching for the literal phrase All may guess from his too fervent tongue, as finally formulated by the author, will  <em>not</em>  be found, while the expression ‘rolling blaze fire How burns the fire within’  <em>will</em>  be found, even though the author never wrote it. <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup></p>
<p>When comparing two versions of a text, inline variants get in the way and must first be removed <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Computer algorithms commonly used in the humanities for collating texts such as Heckel (1978) and Myers (1987) are not designed to handle inline variants. And no one has yet demonstrated a reliable method for comparing texts that contain them, or proven that it is technically feasible. <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="32-difficulty-of-overcoming-these-problems">3.2 Difficulty of overcoming these problems</h2>
<p>One obvious solution to some of these problems would be to write a program to extract coherent texts from the embedded encoding, retrieving either the first, last or intermediary stages in the text’s evolution. However, in practice this is either difficult or impossible to achieve, for three main reasons.</p>
<h2 id="321-currente-calamo-corrections">3.2.1 Currente calamo corrections</h2>
<p>The original state of a text before any changes were made might seem to be one that could be readily recovered from an embedded encoding of variants, by simply accepting only first-level variants and simple deletions, and rejecting all others. However, the presence of corrections made in the process of writing, or currente calamo, as shown in Figure 8 <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>, makes this difficult or impossible.</p>

<p>Here the author progressively revised the text as he wrote it. He started the sentence with  “All his” , then corrected this immediately to  “The whole of his poetry” . Later he started writing  “his political effusions lack th&hellip;”  then corrected this to  “his political effusions are wanting&hellip;”  then corrected the last two words to:  “are greatly wanting” . All these changes were carried out on the baseline. Simply encoding them as deletions — as they appear on the page — and then writing a program to extract the  “original”  text before deletion would result in the nonsense:  “All his The whole of his poetry would be better for more plainness; while his political effusions lack th are wanting greatly wanting&hellip;.”</p>
<h2 id="322-interpretation-in-markup">3.2.2 Interpretation in markup</h2>
<p>Marking up a text is generally agreed to be an interpretative act <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Interpretation must therefore govern the choice of codes and their application to the representation of inline variants. Extracting coherent texts for searching, reading, or comparison from such transcriptions thus requires, at the very least, the writing of customised software for each set of documents encoded in a project-specific set of conventions. This is further complicated by the fact that even trained encoders have different understandings of what they are looking at on the page and therefore how to encode it. They may even change their encoding practice from day to day <sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. For Harpur we found that over 30 different ways had been used by just three transcribers to record second-level corrections. Even if an encoding can be made syntactically consistent we must ask can it also be made  <em>semantically</em>  consistent: i.e. does each specific instance of an encoding always mean exactly the same thing, and is the same kind of textual phenomenon always encoded in the same way?</p>

<p>An example of the potential for semantic variation is shown in Figure 9. Taken from an early manuscript of  “Dawn and Sunrise in the Snowy Mountains”   <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>, the revisions at the start of the line might be validly encoded in our simplified markup language as And Then [And] or equally as <And Then>[And] or as &lt;And <Then>&gt;[And]. However, the use of capitals at the start of all three words indicates that Harpur revised the text by gradually adding words to the left, so a better encoding might be to reverse the order: [And][<Then>]<And Then>. The question then becomes, how can software process alternative formulations of the same thing in a consistent fashion, and how can it determine the context of each change?</p>
<h2 id="323-conflict-between-graphical-and-temporal-encoding">3.2.3. Conflict between graphical and temporal encoding</h2>
<p>Recording the graphical appearance of the text on the page via the embedded markup method described above makes the extraction of the temporal succession of local changes virtually impossible <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. For example, most transcribers would record line 1 of Figure 1 before line 2, but the temporal sequence is actually 2, 1. Another example is the use of inserted blocks of text. Like many authors, Harpur sometimes redrafts heavily revised portions of his text in the margins or on separate pages, as shown in Figure 10 <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Due to the complex encoding required for inline variants in such cases, encoders tend to record such blocks separately and to specify their graphical layout (e.g. position, orientation) rather than integrate the textual changes they contain as part of the main text <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>, and then record their temporal sequence, if ascertainable.</p>

<p>The temporal sequence of local changes is usually recoverable. Authors provide many cues such as the position of inserted text, deletion marks, sense, the carrying over of changes into revised blocks, etc. that make this possible, even in extreme cases like that shown in Figure 10. A survey of 1,247 local revision-sites in the manuscripts of Harpur revealed that the temporal sequence of changes could be recovered with a high degree of probability in 99.45% of cases. In the doubtful cases, while the layering approach does require the assignment of variants to specific layers, there is no comparative disadvantage. This is because the embedded variant method also requires the assignment of variants to an explicit sequence or nesting of markup.</p>
<p>Writing software to reliably process transcriptions coded for the graphical layout of text into a coherent sequence of temporal layers is ‘challenging’, even for a single project. Such software requires the transcription either to be weighed down with extra encoding in addition to the already heavy markup needed to describe the text’s graphical layout <sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>, or to be encoded twice: once for the graphical layout and once to describe the temporal or  “linear”  sequence <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. The editing of transcriptions and their subsequent reuse are thus impaired <sup id="fnref2:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It looks then as if embedding variants directly into the text-stream at each revision-site leads to serious and insurmountable problems, which can only be resolved by  <em>not</em>  embedding variants into the transcription in the first place. What the layered approach offers instead is a far simpler data model that has no need of customised software to make text readable, searchable and comparable — for it already is.</p>
<h2 id="33-ease-of-editing">3.3 Ease of Editing</h2>
<p>The model of versions and layers also has other advantages. Since the text no longer contains complex markup to describe internal variation it can be edited easily. The only remaining textual features that need to be represented via inline markup are fairly simple textual formats at the paragraph or character levels. Having a readable text mostly devoid of complex markup to compare with the facsimile of the original speeds up initial transcription too. Although as many as nine layers may be required for complex cases, this is mostly confined to a few heavily revised poetical texts. For longer works, such as chapters of a novel, one to three layers should suffice.</p>
<p>Layers are not definitive, and like all text files can be easily changed after initial transcription by the human editor to reflect changing interpretations of the text or increased knowledge of the author’s habits. Layers offer an alternative way of organising the same data as inline markup seeks to encode but in a far simpler form.</p>
<h2 id="34-longevity">3.4 Longevity</h2>
<p>Another key advantage is longevity. The representation of versions and layers generated by the model requires only Unicode text, than which, as already pointed out, there is nothing more stable in the digital world.</p>
<p>Although text is one of the most compact forms of data, each layer requires a complete copy of the document, including its local changes. In most cases this is limited to two or three layers. In the case of Charles Harpur, one poem,  “Sir Gilbert Blount” , required nine layers <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. Apart from a few cases like this, out a corpus of 4,596 manuscript pages, the average number of layers needed per manuscript version was only 2.1. Modern computers have many gigabytes of storage to accommodate movies, images and sound files that are many times larger than such simple text files as these.</p>
<p>Layers can be grouped within folders or directories, one folder for each version, and one over-arching folder for each work containing the versions. The use of file directories likewise goes back to Multics in the 1960s and hence has a similar pedigree to ASCII. Like Unicode, it can be assumed it will continue to exist into the distant future.</p>
<h2 id="4-disadvantages-of-versions-and-layers">4. Disadvantages of versions and layers</h2>
<p>The main disadvantage of the layering and versioning approach is, at present, its unfamiliarity. Current editors of modern manuscripts, who are used to embedding variants in the transcription as they encounter them, would need to adjust their practice. Technicians who process the transcriptions would also need to learn new, albeit simpler, techniques. To be adapted to the new approach existing texts would have to be converted by splitting them into layers. Although practicable, this would involve some customisation of the conversion software to accommodate different encoding conventions, as well as manual intervention in difficult cases of textual variation. These costs would not be insignificant, but they would all be short-term, and outweighed by the longer-term benefits. For new projects using layers from the start these problems would not exist.</p>
<p>The computation of differences between versions and layers is sometimes imperfect. For example, in the text of Figure 11 <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>:  “Nought might reward  the his  the  aim  blow, however true;”  a difference tool would compute the second the to be shared by layers 1 and 3, whereas in fact it was deleted and then restored.</p>

<p>In the Harpur manuscripts about 2% of inline variants are restorations of earlier readings. Although this detail is not recorded in the layer representation itself it will still be visible in the facsimile, and if the page image is connected closely with the text this can easily be checked by the reader or editor. Although small inaccuracies such as these may be inherent in the layer model they are very much dwarfed by the widely recognised inaccuracies and limitations of hierarchical markup systems for representing internal variation <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. Heavily revised holographs are also extremely difficult to record using embedded markup, because the encoding quickly becomes too complex, but this difficulty is not shared by the layering technique, where the text of each layer is always simple, however complex the revisions. Variants are also not allowed to overlap when using embedded hierarchical markup, but with layering they are. This is a significant advantage.</p>
<p>As a consequence of delegating to a piece of software the task of computing differences between versions and layers, the accuracy of that process is obviously determined by the efficiency of the software. While no program based on a heuristic algorithm can be perfect, the degree of error introduced in this way can be reduced by subsequent versions of the software, or by new and better programs, while retaining exactly the same versions and layers. Biologists have progressively improved both the speed and accuracy of their sequence alignment programs since the 1970s. Adopting this new strategy of organising textual data will encourage the same process of progressive improvement to play out in textual archiving and editing.</p>
<h2 id="5-implementation">5. Implementation</h2>
<p>Although the model of versions and layers presented here greatly simplifies the encoding of the textual content of documents, it does not reduce it to plain text. For example, what is to be done about features like underlining, semantic metadata, print formatting like italics, divisions into stanzas, paragraphs, speeches, page numbers etc.? Since the concept of versions and layers is unrelated to the technology used to represent them, each layer may be represented in HTML, the markup language of the Web, or digital humanists may prefer XML, the eXtensible Markup Language, or LMNL the layered markup notation language <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. Alternatively, and for greatest longevity, a standoff representation where all external annotation and feature markup is kept separate from the text will insulate it from the rapidly changing technological standards that govern such markup and annotation technologies <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. Using this approach all external annotation may be stored in the form of a layer of markup corresponding to a single layer of text, or using any other desired system. Such markup systems will probably be replaced by something else in the future. This may lead to data loss, but with the standoff representation the text at least will remain coherently readable, searchable and reusable.</p>
<p>The preparation of versions and layers can be accomplished using a simple plain text editor. The transcriber may display the source document as an image on one side of the computer screen, and copy the transcribable text on the right, starting with the text’s final state. Once a complete copy of this has been obtained it may be regarded as sufficient in itself. If not, further layers can be transcribed by copying the final layer, and then undoing the topmost change at each local revision-site to record, successively, the lower layers. If the deleted text in some layer is unreadable due to being obscured by overwriting or crossing-out, such cases can be dealt via markup (internal or external) to indicate unclear or missing text.</p>
<p>Embedded mathematical formulae and graphics, as found for example in the Wittgenstein manuscripts <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>, can be treated similarly. An approximation of the formula or graphic in plain text can be used to serve as a placeholder. For example, the formula x2 could be written x^2 or an image as [picture of a ship]. This placeholder can then be marked up externally with the actual formula or graphic, and rendered using appropriate software into more elegant forms that replace the placeholder with the actual formula or graphic. In this way all content, textual or otherwise, can be recorded successfully in layers.</p>
<h2 id="51-comparison-of-versions-and-layers">5.1 Comparison of versions and layers</h2>
<p>The final piece of technology needed to make this model work is the ability to compute differences. Since the versions and layers are plain texts (or, if marked-up may be recovered as plain texts) they can simply be compared with each other. Such software is available now and will be in the future, since computation of differences is a fundamental computing problem. For example, computer scientists use difference-computing tools to save revisions of computer code for later restoration. Difference-computing software can evolve over time without affecting the simple representation of the textual data as versions and layers. <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup></p>
<p>The display of versions and layers can be accomplished by using comparison software to compute the differences between layers, or between versions. When comparing layers the shared text may be greyed-out as a reminder to the reader-user that the text does not have the status of a full version. Full versions may have their text displayed in black. An example where this has been done can be seen in the edition of Harpur’s multi-versioned poem  “Creek of the Four Graves”   <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. The display of both versions and layers employs red (to indicate deletion) and blue (to indicate insertion).</p>
<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>If we are to make any significant progress in transcribing the vast collection of manuscript and early-print material in our libraries and museums, a much more efficient and durable method of recording their content than embedding internal variation data into the text is needed. The latter established method requires us to revise the transcriptions we already have and the software that manipulates them as technology continues to evolve. This prospect is unviable, and a change in our practice is needed. The present model of versions and layers provides a justification for change.</p>
<ol>
<li>i.e. transpositions, connected variants, open variants, incoherent corrections, separately revised test-blocks, and restoration of previously deleted text.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Scholarly editors typically use the term ‘state’ to indicate a document- or version-wide text. The technical requirement addressed here suggests its adaptation for local sites of textual revision. In fact this parallels, theoretically if not practically, the detection by bibliographers from the 1940s of in-press correction during the printing of Shakespeare’s First Folio. Printed sheets were not discarded, leading to variation in states of the text among copies made during the same print run. In the handpress period, no two surviving copies of the same edition of a printed work need necessarily bear the same state of the text.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.While keyword search will retrieve all documents containing all or most of the words in a search expression but in any order, literal search is more useful for finding specific expressions. A survey by the author of 30 digital scholarly editions revealed that only 10% of editions could find literal expressions that span inline substitutions <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>.</p>
<p>4.Dekker et al. 2015 attempt to overcome this problem by treating internal variants either as formats, or by marking them up as variant clusters to be passed through the collation engine without change. However, as yet they have offered no mathematical model that might vindicate this approach as a general solution for comparing texts containing embedded variants. Schäuble and Gabler (2018) achieved a partial success by extracting the first and last layers of document transcriptions containing embedded variants, and then used a collation tool to compute the differences between versions which were then used to create an intermediary transcription between documents <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. The  “first”  layer includes currente calamo corrections <sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>, both deletions and their replacements.</p>
<p>5.While striving to keep the argument on a purely theoretical footing, some examples of suitable textual alignment tools would establish the practicality of the alignment process. Bourdaillet and Ganascia (2006) with MEDITE were the first to show that Ukkonen’s suffix tree algorithm (1995) could be applied to humanities texts for the detection of transpositions <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. Schäuble and Gabler (2018) used the TUSTEP collate tool to align versions of Virginia Woolf’s  “A Sketch of the Past”   <sup id="fnref2:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. The author’s own program, nmerge (2009), has been used to align the texts in the Charles Harpur Critical Archive <sup id="fnref2:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Computer sciences and humanities are rightly considered different scholarly disciplines and they use different languages, approaches and paradigms. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that mutual misunderstandings, unbalanced expertise levels, and lack of interest in the other discipline are issues that regularly occur within Digital Humanities-projects that typically work on a new technology and humanities-based research question. In their anthology, <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> define this core challenge for Digital Humanities research as follows:  “Mutual incomprehension persists. Generally speaking, scholars and artists understand little about the technologies that are so radically transforming their fields, while IT-specialists often have scant or no training in the humanities and traditional arts” . Insight into collaborative research practices, and interdisciplinary collaborative research practices in particular, can shed light on the quickly evolving field of Digital Humanities. What does it mean to  “do”  Digital Humanities? In this article, we look at the  <em>practice</em>  of interdisciplinary collaborative research between computer sciences and humanities based media studies.</p>
<p>A case in point is the Dutch television archive project BRIDGE (Building Rich Links to Enable Television History), a collaboration of the Information and Language Processing Group of University of Amsterdam, the media studies group Centre for Television in Transition of Utrecht University, and the national radio and television archive The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. The project showcases the synergy of the two academic disciplines involved, computer sciences and media studies, which collaboratively developed and tested digital tools for exploration of archival television data. Collaboration in DH is often, as <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> states,  “aimed at building something that works — a tool, a resource, an online collection” . The focus of the research in the BRIDGE-project, however, was not solely on building digital tools for the humanities, but also on the scientific evaluation of tools and algorithms, as part of computer sciences, and a study on how such tools and algorithms may advance insights in the field of Media Studies. The main output of BRIDGE is a PhD dissertation in computer science, publications in both humanities and computer science conferences and journals, and prototypes of tools (which are eventually developed into sustainable tools in follow-up projects <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> . This very interdisciplinary and evaluation-driven set-up makes the project different from many other DH-projects in which the tools, the technological infrastructures and the humanities research seem to be central.</p>
<p>Many scholars have investigated collaboration practices in the broader setting of technology and software production. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, for instance, conducted a large-scale critical comparative study of interdisciplinary institutions based on ethnographic fieldwork and an Internet-based survey. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> bases her article on an autoethnography of one team member during the development of software. Most studies use qualitative research methods (notably social science-based methods such as ethnography and interviews) to produce case studies that focus on how members of a project that involves more than one discipline (struggle to) communicate, negotiate, and cooperate. In this article we also report on an auto-ethnography, not by one humanities or social science researcher who observes scientists and engineers, but by a humanities scholar  <em>and</em>  a computer scientist who observe themselves,  “the other” , and their collaborative research.</p>
<p>Instead of a methodological account of the technical development and testing of the tools, we take a meta stance and reflect on the project’s day-to-day steps in the preparation for, execution of, and reporting on the research carried out. In this article, we revisit these research processes. The main focus of the research process was on conducting user studies. The technical results of these user studies are already published in computer science outlets (<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>).<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Taking an empirical glance at the digital humanities, thus at  “doing digital humanities” , we show how the boundaries between the scholarly disciplines computer sciences and humanities-based media studies in BRIDGE are maintained, crossed and blurred, and to what extent transdisciplinarity emerged. By making the research process more transparent, this paper aims to demystify disciplinary boundaries, to reflect on the production of interdisciplinary knowledge, and to provide a future look into Digital Humanities research by providing suggestions for best practices.</p>
<h2 id="2-about-disciplines-and-situated-knowledge">2 About disciplines and situated knowledge</h2>
<p>At the core of interdisciplinary collaboration is the very notion of discipline. Defining a discipline requires caution as it has different interpretations. We follow <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> who pragmatically define a discipline as  “a field of inquiry with a particular  <em>object of research</em>  and a corresponding body of accumulated specialist  <em>knowledge</em> ”  (italics by authors). Simply put, academic disciplines are created by groups of scholars as a form of organization of their knowledge about a certain object. The very boundaries and definitions of disciplines vary over time.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past four decades, interdisciplinarity has been widely discussed in academic literature. Terms such as multi-, cross- and transdisciplinarity are used to describe different interactions between disciplines. All terms can be situated on a  <em>continuum</em> : while multi-disciplinary means that there is just communication, but not so much mutual exchange, cross- already means some more exchange, while trans- means that there is a creation of something new that surpasses the boundaries of disciplines. According to <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>, transdisciplinarity goes beyond interdisciplinarity as the first is much more dynamic. In other words, transdisciplinarity can be defined as the radicalization of  “existing disciplinary norms and practices” ,    “allowing researchers to go beyond their parent disciplines, using a shared conceptual framework that draws together concepts, theories, and approaches from disciplines into something new that transcends them all”   <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  . Similar to multi- and cross-disciplinarity, transdisciplinarity is not a given, but a process, something that is created and constructed over time.</p>
<p>Knowledge, too, is not a given, but a construction of which the outside-inside boundaries can be theorized as    “power moves, not moves toward truth”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  . In a constructionist view, knowledge claims are a continuous struggle for meaning, which makes it meaningless outside its own context. Yet, we approach the collaboration between two disciplines and interdisciplinary knowledge production as an Actor-Network, as coined by <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Actor-Network Theory (ANT) addresses the construction and transformation of human values and knowledge and the notion of the actor as agent <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. According to <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, agents are individual entities that assert force while interacting with other entities. They form what Latour calls actor-networks. Agents can be both actors, which are human entities, but they can also be actants delineating not only humans, but also non-human entities, such as interfaces. Agents are always bound to other agents acting together and therefore the output of the entire actor-network cannot be predicted by any agent separately. When investigating interdisciplinary collaboration, then, there is an interaction between two disciplines in terms of knowledge negotiation between agents.</p>
<p>A good addition to Actor-Network Theory can be found in feminist science studies. To pinpoint the constructivism of knowledge, Donna Haraway coined the concept of    “situated knowledge”   <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  . The concept is related to science studies and was developed by Haraway in response to Sandra Harding&rsquo;s  <em>The Science Question in Feminism</em>   <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, in which the latter formulated standpoint theory. In a nutshell, these feminist scholars stress the role of the situated researcher and situated knowledge to reflect the importance of  <em>diverse</em>  ways of knowing for improving the production of knowledge. Situated knowledge, then, means that all subjects have embedded positions: they are part of and actively co-construct a disciplinary-bound knowledge. In this context, <sup id="fnref2:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> launched the  “greased poles dilemma” : it is hard to climb a pole when you are holding onto both ends of the pole. The pole is a metaphor for the epistemological question (i.c. what is regarded as acceptable knowledge within a discipline): the duality between positivism and empiricism on the one hand and social constructivism on the other hand. She argues that a way to overcome these dualities is to articulate  “partial visions” , and thus  “situated knowledge” . Therefore, these scholars are advocates of multi-method approaches <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In terms of our endeavour: how is the knowledge building of the media studies scholar related to the knowledge building of the computer scientist? How can both  “situated”  scholars collaborate, if they can? In our article, we will show that doing Digital Humanities research is a process in which holding on to each end of the pole is the intrinsic position at the beginning of the climb, but that the key to collaboration lies within identifying, acknowledging and learning about the situatedness of the knowledge of the self/own discipline and that of the other researcher and discipline. Doing Digital Humanities, therefore, is not only about using tools to produce papers or developing tools/interfaces per se, it is also (and perhaps chiefly) about  <em>the process (and attempts)</em>  of making research and tools transparent by making one&rsquo;s own and the other’s discipline’s assumptions explicit. In other words, it is a matter of building a bridge between both discipline-specific ends of the pole, walking on the bridge and (trying to) look at one&rsquo;s own and the other discipline-specific end from another perspective, as to acknowledge their differences and similarities.</p>
<h2 id="3-methodology">3 Methodology</h2>
<p>The article is an analysis of the daily research practice by the two central staff members of the project: one researcher in media studies, and one researcher in computer sciences, a (double) self-reflexive account <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  The postdoc in media studies has a specialisation in Film and Television Studies. The computer scientist is specialised in Information Retrieval. The analysis in this article follows a unique approach as the authors are also the subjects of the research conducted for the article.</p>
<p>In order to reconstruct the research steps, we used different types of data: on the one hand e-mails and on the other hand a series of semi-structured interviews. We read our e-mail conversations first, and then the humanities postdoc prepared a set of interview questions and interview topics that formed the basis for a conversation between postdoc and PhD student in the form of semi-structured interviews. This was done three times: halfway through the project (year 2), at the end of the project (year 4) and at the start of the writing process of this article (year 5).</p>
<p>In the data (emails and transcripts of interviews), we look at what we - the two central staff members on the project - say and how we say it; which words we use. Latour, as <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> notes, does not provide a way in which the agents interpret their networks. To interpret the networks and the researchers’ discourses, we rely on the theories of Stuart Hall (1992) on identity as discursive construction. He approaches identity formation as a process of becoming rather than being, a process of identication that is constructed on the basis of recognizing certain characteristics shared with another person, group or an idea. Othering, then, is a form of defining the self: when making differences with the out-group explicit, the in-group defines itself. This implies that words such as we versus them, or I versus you are important markers of identity construction. Therefore, we specifically look at the use of these pronouns to see how the researchers’ disciplinary identities are being constructed and how knowledge is being formed.</p>
<p>The process of othering, however, puts constraints on the writing of an article across disciplines. It is a true challenge to write an article from two different viewpoints and paradigms. Therefore, we needed a new way to cope with this. Following Bartscherer and Coover’s book  “Switching codes: thinking through digital technology in the humanities and arts”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, we believe that a conversation structure of the empirical sections enhances and highlights not only the collaboration in the project but also the very act of writing this article. While the interviews are quoted as I and you, the article itself is written as we. The we are both authors, but as this is a humanities journal with (largely) a humanities readership, we take humanities discourse and concepts as leading. For the description of the research process, we use the third person (he/she/the researcher/they) in order to identify ourselves as research objects for the sake of this article. As such, the article is an expression of standpoints (in plural) of which the situatedness is made semantically explicit by quoting ourselves and using the third person. In the conversations, the quotes by the Computer Science PhD student will be indicated by CS (while in fact it is Marc Bron). The Media Studies postdoc researcher’s quotes are indicated by MS (while in fact it is Jasmijn Van Gorp). The article is written from a multi-disciplinary standpoint, by means of the collaborative software WriteLatex, in itself a way of doing collaborative research. Therefore, the article is in itself, to quote <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>,  “science in the making” .</p>
<p>In the following empirical sections, we present a discursive analysis and deconstruction of the interaction between agents, where different backgrounds lead to misunderstandings but also to interdisciplinary knowledge production. We divided our analysis into four chapters which (humanities-wise) correspond with the classic narrative structure of Hollywood films: establishing shot, encounter, conflict and reconciliation. In section 4, we set the scene by elaborating on the basic characteristics of the two disciplines computer sciences and media studies. In section 5, 6, and 7 we follow a chronological order, corresponding with the identified three research phases in the project: the encounter, the struggle and reconciliation. For each phase, we first outline all research steps, then we discuss the challenges encountered and collaboration strategies per research step in a conversation structure. We conclude with some best practices for collaborative digital humanities projects in section 8.</p>
<h2 id="4-setting-the-scene-the-two-disciplines-unravelled">4 Setting the scene: the two disciplines unravelled</h2>
<p>In order to establish the context of the interdisciplinary collaboration, we define in this section the disciplinary characteristics of our own disciplines as viewed by ourselves. That is, as disciplines are contested concepts and continuously rethought, it is important to know how we ourselves experience the defining characteristics of our very own disciplines. Each one of us wrote the section concerning our own discipline, also referring to existing literature where relevant. In <a href="#table01">Table 1</a> we give an overview of the main identified characteristics of the two disciplines. We look at the object of research, methods of knowledge building, research methods, pace, and publication traditions.<br>
Overview of how we define our own discipline         <strong>Computer Sciences (CS)</strong>        <strong>Humanities based Media Studies (MS)</strong>            <em>Object of research</em>     Information systems  Media and Culture         <em>Knowledge building</em>     Discovering structures  Associative         <em>Main methods</em>     Experiments, computer-led, quantitative  Interpretation, qualitative         <em>Publication pace</em>     Fast  Slow         <em>Research / authorships</em>     Team  Single         <em>Most valued publication outlet</em>     Conference paper  Monograph   <br>
The distinction between sciences and humanities is often referred to as the objectivity of knowledge versus experiential aspects. Or, to put it differently, the sciences cumulate knowledge until a structure has been discovered, whereas the humanities&rsquo; work is associative and particularistic <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Computer sciences is a science discipline, and Information Retrieval is one of the main subdisciplines. Information retrieval (IR) is finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need from within large collections (usually stored on computers) <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. A related discipline is Information Studies, which is concerned with how people interact with systems and how those systems can be improved <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. This discipline is closer to the Humanities, as it also involves qualitative methods such as observation. Although media studies can be situated both in humanities and social sciences, the majority of television research (still) takes place in humanities departments. Media studies has the media as object of analysis, either in a centralised or decentralised way <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Media studies researchers use a variety of data: textual data such as newspapers, Twitter feeds and magazines, and audiovisual data such as films, radio, games and television programs <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Evidently, the sciences are also slipping into Media Studies (and vice versa), which is most clearly seen in New Media Studies, which concern the study of Social Media, computers and information systems such as mobile communication. They often use quantitative  “big data”  analysis, but are often adding a critical interpretative layer to it.</p>
<p>In terms of methodology, the two disciplines also differ. In Computer Sciences, computer-led experiments are the core, as well as creating new algorithms. Computer sciences measure and use (solely) quantitative methods. The basic skills a computer scientist should master are: good understanding of theory, algorithms, computer design and programming languages. For the humanities-based Media Studies, the individual researcher is much more central. The researcher’s own interpretation is key. Qualitative methods are better suited for the humanistic stance in the humanities <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Some skills a humanities researcher should master are: critical reflection, interpretation and theoretical conceptualisation.</p>
<p>The practicalities of the two disciplines also differ. Computer scientists often work in teams of 2 to 6 people, running experiments that are supervised by a professor. Computer science is a quickly evolving field that wants to publish results at least every six months in order to be first. First, they write a conference paper of usually 10 pages, which is peer-reviewed and, if accepted, published in proceedings. A common follow-up is to write a journal article on those aspects of the conference paper that need more in-depth analysis. Given these factors, the scientific output of computer sciences, as in other  “hard”  sciences, is high in comparison with the humanities.</p>
<p>Humanities research is sometimes defined as  “lonely”  research, or as <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> describes the humanities researcher: a  “lone scholar” . In the humanities, scholars have tended to be physically alone when at work because writing tends to be by nature a solitary activity. In the humanities, the research often takes place during the writing. The argument of an individual (or duo-) based (humanities) versus a team-based research (sciences) tradition can be easily made by looking at random issues of Media Studies journals as  <em>Cinema Journal</em> ,  <em>Television and New Media</em> , and monographs in the field of film, television and media studies. Edited volumes seem to be more collaborative, but the conference of  <em>Society for Cinema and Media Studies</em> , i.e. the major American conference in the field of film and media studies, has a majority of single authored papers and does not give the opportunity to include more than two authors on papers. For research assessment, some Humanities departments do not take publications with more than x number of authors into account, while other Humanities departments encourage co-authored articles by giving them more weight than a single-authored article. Furthermore, for humanities-based media studies, the single-authored monograph is an important outlet of scholarly work which partly explains the slow publication pace of the discipline in comparison with computer sciences.</p>
<p>We are perfectly aware of the fact that our own definitions and characteristics of the disciplines as put here can be contested; however, these are the differences as perceived by us, as we encounter(ed) them in our very own European, national and time-specific contexts. This self-defined overview of differences between the disciplines, provides the starting point, the  “point zero” , showing where the following discourses stem from and, more importantly, where the challenges can be situated when it comes to interdisciplinary projects and where transdisciplinarity may arise. The very research direction in which both disciplines met and the discursive field that surfaces as a result of interdisciplinary interactions and negotiations between the agents involved can probably be situated in what <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> calls  “Cultural Science” : a movement that challenges the current disciplinary distinctions between the humanities and social sciences on the one hand, and the math-based sciences on the other hand. It can as well be defined as Digital Humanities, of course. Whatever concept is used, we tackle the disciplinary boundaries between the sciences and the humanities in the next sections from the double perspective of humanities and computer sciences. The question, now, is how the project evolved and how the researchers of the two disciplines may have come closer to each other.</p>
<h2 id="5-the-encounter-two-disciplines-limited-interaction">5 The encounter: two disciplines, limited interaction</h2>
<h2 id="51-description-of-the-research-process">5.1 Description of the research process</h2>
<p>In the first year, 2009, the PhD student in computer sciences was the only staff member. Research was focused on entity search and algorithms for linking entities, i.e., exploring algorithms for a specific task: entity search. A good example of how entity search is used in modern search engines is knowledge cards, i.e., for searches about people, companies, or locations, not only a list of 10 result links is presented but in specific cases additional information is presented. For example, for the search terms Michael Jackson pictures, links to his work, and a short biography are shown for the famous artist. The algorithms guess which person the user intended to find, i.e., the artist and not any other person named Michael Jackson<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> , and that collected information about this person was the subject of study.</p>
<p>At the start of the second year, 2010, when the postdoc entered the project, the team was complete and could start their interdisciplinary research. An important practical observation regarding the project we have to add here is that the computer scientist and media studies scholar did not reside in the same building, but work at different universities and even in different cities. The computer scientist worked in a large industrial science campus outside Amsterdam; the media studies scholar worked in a historical mansion as part of the humanities faculty of Utrecht University. At the start of the project, they did not meet regularly, as they were also both living in the cities where their university was located.</p>
<p>In order to develop a new tool, the first step was to understand how media researchers use their current main tool to acquire research material, i.e., the existing tool (catalogue) of the national radio and television archive, called  “iMMix”  (<a href="http://zoeken.beeldengeluid.nl/internet/index.aspx">zoeken.beeldengeluid.nl</a>). For the first study within BRIDGE, the team set out to investigate how  “the known item search system”  iMMix can be used for an exploratory search task in order to compile a list of features that would be desirable for a new search system. iMMix formed the  “baseline” , a concept which is common in computer sciences but not at all in the humanities. Baseline means that it is the set that is the point of reference, the standard system that will be contrasted with the new system. The latter, then, should perform better than the standard system.</p>
<p>The online search system of the The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, iMMix, consists of metadata descriptions of around 1.2 (currently 1.6) million television and radio programmes of Dutch public broadcasters, provided by professional annotators. It has a simple and an advanced search option that allows users to search on specific fields. After the search results have been displayed, they can be refined by a filter system. However, the search system is developed for an experienced group of users: the broadcast professionals. Broadcast professionals, in their need to reuse material, often know what they are looking for, using a directed search, for instance, by providing a title or specific content. Consequently, iMMix mainly supports known item search and can be considered as a known item search system. Media researchers, however, would benefit from an exploratory search system, a system that supports them in browsing, learning about the representation of their research topic in the collection, and jumping from one topic to another <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As the test person for a pilot study with the standard system iMMix, the researchers were looking for a media researcher with no or just a little experience with the search system and someone with a limited prior knowledge of the archival content in the archive, so s/he would have to rely heavily on the search system for support. The team did not have to look far to find a volunteer. The postdoc was the ideal candidate: a Belgian postdoc in media studies who had never worked with the Dutch iMMix before. The team set up a small experiment, in which the postdoc had to do a search on a self-selected topic. During the search, she had to think aloud and this in the presence of her fellow researcher of computer sciences who observed her search behaviour. The search was being logged, videotaped and sound recorded. She searched for Russia initially and ended up with three clusters of programmes for further scrutiny: two travel reports, two programmes about migrant children and two current affairs programmes (see <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> for a detailed first-person account of the 2-hour search session).</p>
<p>By then, it was time to conduct research for a computer science paper, as part of the PhD-project in computer sciences. As users the researchers chose to work with 22 media studies students (freshmen). They had to find five television programs for three tasks in a limited period of time, by using the iMMix search system. The tasks for the users have been designed, by varying the difficulty in terms of prior knowledge. The three tasks were defined in such a way that the students could not use any of the elements/terms given in the task to find correct answers and had to extensively explore the archive in order to do so. The first two questions were situated in contemporary times, while the latter was a historical one: (i) find 5 television programs with comedians from a non-western country; (ii) find 5 episodes of drama series in which location plays an important role; and (iii) find 5 game shows with a female host broadcast during the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s. For the first task for example, students first had to find names of comedians of a non-western country, while not being allowed to use any other tool or search engine besides iMMix, before being able to find correct answers/television programs. After completion of the three tasks (or when the maximum 10-minute time limit per task was over), students completed a survey that also contained open questions. They also conducted four in-depth interviews with students after the computer experiment. The study showed that the search system iMMix did not provide the necessary support for exploratory search by (student-)researchers (see <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> for a detailed account).</p>
<h2 id="52-conversation-about-the-research-process">5.2 Conversation about the research process</h2>
<p>In the first year, there was only one researcher. The computer science PhD-student recalls:  “It was really informatics research; there was no humanities aspect in there. The task has been evaluated on a benchmark set, created articially.”  After one year of  “hard core”  computer science research, the arrival of the humanities postdoc in the project changed the scene.</p>
<p>The very first collaborative action was the observation of the postdoc. For the computer scientist, it was very inspiring to observe a media researcher at work:</p>
<p>CS: It was such an eye opener for me. You did totally other things than I expected. What you did was totally different from the way that we evaluated our entity links. I was immediately inspired and knew how to improve the interface and how we could improve our algorithms. I realized that what we did before, making lists of entities, is not that relevant for the search process of media researchers.</p>
<p>The media studies postdoc, however, was initially very surprised that the observation was so helpful for her computer science colleague. Two years later, she started to see what was so illuminating about her very first search when she took the videotapes from the shelves and started to analyse her own search. By retrospectively observing her own search behavior, she understood that the relation between (re)search object, research question and search behavior of humanities scholars is quite particular. It resulted, amongst others, in a reflective article on her very first search in the archive <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. In the end, therefore, the observational study of the postdoc using a think aloud procedure turned out to be quite a  “ground breaking” , thus effective, way to get to know each other’s specificities and to get introduced to each other’s discipline.</p>
<p>However, back then, the observatioal study of the postdoc was considered as rather limited: it did not provide the sheer size/quantity that is usually required for a computer science paper. Therefore, the PhD-student wanted to conduct a user study with a high number of participants to have a baseline measurement, in order to be able to measure the improvement of the future (to be developed) exploratory search system.</p>
<p>CS: I was used to evaluate things, so I wanted to evaluate, evaluate, evaluate. By then, we thought it would be possible to  “measure”  how well the old system iMMix worked and then how well our new system works. Pretty naive.</p>
<p>The postdoc remembers that she did not really understand the purpose of the user study back then. Words such as baseline measurement and exploratory search system did not ring a bell.</p>
<p>MS: I had really no clue what you wanted to do with the user study, and what you meant with exploratory search system. And then, at a certain point, I interpreted exploratory search system as something that has to do with cultural memory. I translated it as a system that inspires users to formulate new search terms; to provide them with inspiration in case their cultural memory is not sufficient to find television programmes. It is a kind of memory machine: it gives suggestions for new search terms.</p>
<p>CS: I really had no clue what you meant with cultural memory, and I am still struggling with it.</p>
<p>For the postdoc exploratory search system was a fuzzy concept, while cultural memory was a vague concept for the PhD-student. Paradoxically, it was this very semantic gap that provided inspiration for the humanities scholar to give a  “humanities”  touch to the user study. The humanities postdoc eventually wanted to do an empirical study of the concept of cultural memory by conducting qualitative interviews with students.</p>
<p>MS: I was trying to find ways to make the study also interesting for my Media Studies research. So, I insisted on doing some in-depth interviews with the students to complement the quantitative results. I did not see how quantitative data such as mouse clicks could possibly fit into a media studies research design. Of course, now I do know. But back then I really considered you and your goal as  “Other” , something I did not understand.</p>
<p>In the end, the four interviews did not provide sufficient ground for a separate humanities paper, so both researchers worked on a computer science paper together. The result of the study gave some insight in the search behavior of students, but the scholars both realized that the quantitative measurements as well as the four interviews with students were not sufficient to fully grasp the particularities of search and search systems of media researchers. They needed a different approach for their next user studies. However, they did not realize back then that the  “seed”  (or solution) for a better set-up of a user study was exactly the combination of quantitive measurements with qualitative interviews, as shown in the next sections of this article.</p>
<p>While the semantic gap provided inspiration in some occasions, it also impeded the progress. There was a lack of semantic interoperability. For example, as preparation for the user study, the postdoc had to create tasks for the students, formulate queries for the interface.</p>
<p>MS: I remember that I had to formulate queries. I really had no clue about what a query meant, so I used the word key word instead. But key word to you meant something totally different, so we had the one misunderstanding following the other.</p>
<p>A query is a request for information from a database, such as Comedian AND non-Western. A key word, in computer science and information studies language, however, are the tags attributed to documents. In the case of the iMMix interface, the keywords were the ones on display in the metadata field keywords of television programmes. While the postdoc did not really understand why she had to formulate the tasks for the students in a computer query language, the computer scientist did not really understand why the postdoc was referring to tags all the time.</p>
<p>In general, the staff-members of the project really had to get used to each other, and were still focused on their own field: CS:  “The first phase was interesting but also frustrating. I really had to get used to the way humanities researchers work and it was unclear how we could benefit from each other.”</p>
<p>MS: For me, it was quite a shock, too. I was used to do my own individual research, to take my time. I was not used to create something other than a paper, and to work together with someone who works in a totally different paradigm. It was exciting but at the same time I was really worried, admittedly. I wanted to write a monograph as end-product of the project, or at least conduct research with the tools which were about to be developed, and I did not see a way how this would happen within the framework of computer science experiments. I was afraid I would not have the time to conduct any humanities research.</p>
<p>Both researchers define the other discipline as  “other”  and also talk in terms of us versus them. The second user study was designed while the two central staff members had two different goals in mind. There was only limited overlap or common understanding between the two disciplines. Each researcher regarded his or her own discipline as the most important. For the computer scientist, it meant that there should be enough participants to make the statistics reliable. For the humanities postdoc, it meant that she tried to obtain some interesting qualitative data. In terms of situated knowledge, both researchers held to their own end of the pole.</p>
<p>The computer scientist, who started a year earlier, was already able to see the contours of the humanities pole and already started building a bridge. He was excited about the possibilities, and started to learn about Media Studies. He also realized that they needed a different approach to deal with humanities scholars. The media studies scholar who started a year later, on the other hand, firmly held on to her pre-defined end of the pole which is humanities, and was not planning to build a bridge, let alone walking on it. The  “other”  discipline was still looking  “alien”  to her in her first six months of the project. The postdoc was not really accustomed to the computer science working style yet, and was convinced the humanities part of the research (i.e. conducting research with the new tools they would develop) was much more her cup of tea. The level of collaboration started to improve in the next phase of the research project.</p>
<h2 id="6-the-struggle-a-productive-negotiation-process">6 The struggle: a productive negotiation process</h2>
<h2 id="61-description-of-the-research-process">6.1 Description of the research process</h2>
<p>After one year of the  “joint”  project, the researchers gradually started to really collaborate. The main aim was the development and testing of the exploratory search system MeRDES (Media Researchers’ Data Exploration Suite). It is in this phase that the two disciplines started to be transcended.</p>
<p>First of all, the idea for MeRDES emerged when the two staff members were both attending a talk of one of the creators of Google’s N-gram Viewer. Within 30 minutes the researchers realized that it would be really good to have such an n-gram viewer for the television archive as an exploratory search system. And so, they started to develop a kind of N-gram viewer for the television archive, which they called Media Researchers’ Exploration Suite, abbreviated to MeRDES<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  (see <a href="#figure01">figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>MeRDES is specically developed for media studies research and has two goals. First, it provides users with support for exploration, i.e., support in formulating key words and exploring various aspects of a topic (i.e., a tool for retrieval). A second aim is to provide support for discovering patterns in the data (i.e., a tool for analysis). As data for the search engine, we used the same large metadata set as is used in iMMix. They incorporated two side-by-side versions of a standard exploratory search tool that contains cloud filters. Based on Google’s N-gram Viewer, the researchers added a timeline visualization, and a term statistics visualization in which the characteristics of the result sets obtained with each side of the tool are shown and can be compared.</p>
<p>In order to develop MeRDES, two focus group discussions with media researchers were conducted at two different media studies institutes. The team showed them a mock-up of MeRDES and asked for feedback. Once the new tool was developed, they tested a first version by means of a usability study with and tested by 30 computer science students (freshmen). The feedback was given to the software developer, who improved the system. With the improved system, they were able to conduct a remote online user study with 39 media studies scholars from the Netherlands and the Dutch speaking part of Belgium. After having viewed a tutorial video and having practiced with the tool, the media researchers were given the following search task in this third study: Imagine that you have to write a research paper on the portrayal of migrants on Dutch television. Try to find relevant programs in the television archive. The goal of exploring the archive is formulating the initial research question for your paper. After the search session, the users were asked to provide a research question and also feedback in a post-test survey, both by means of check boxes and open questions. The study showed that the double (subjunctive) interface supported a wider variety of research questions.

<p>In parallel with the development of MeRDES, the researchers started conducting interviews with media researchers: PhD students, postdocs, assistant, associate and full professors. They asked them to pick one of their own research projects and reconstruct their research process. This part of the research was  “purely”  qualitative, and resulted in a peer-reviewed article about the research process of media researchers and the position of the research question in this process (see <sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>).</p>
<h2 id="62-conversation-about-the-research-process">6.2. Conversation about the research process</h2>
<p>Although both researchers shared the idea about the usefulness of a tool providing an N-gram viewer type functionality, they had very different ideas about how such a tool would operate, which impeded the development of the tool. Retrospectively, it was really a struggle; one of the most difficult episodes in the project.</p>
<p>While the computer scientist started to understand and feel comfortable with the field of media studies, the media studies postdoc had to adjust to the speed and way of working.</p>
<p>MS: The development of MeRDES felt really frustrating to me because the development went so fast. There was no time for me to really read literature and theorize the tool. But we had planned a user study, so we had no other choice than speeding up. The worst thing that could have happened is that we had 39 scholars available to test, but no tool. It really felt as a high speed train. I was not used to do things  “now” . If I had deadlines when I was still doing humanities research, I had at least two weeks, and most likely one month. I also remember you were always asking me what is the time line? At first, I thought you were referring to the timeline graph in the interface, but then I realized you meant planning with it. And now I really know why it was so important to have a strict planning.</p>
<p>The postdoc had difficulties in following the pace. The only way to cope with it was to plan more strictly what she did.</p>
<p>Most difficulties were situated — again — at the level of a lack of semantic interoperability. Another good example to illustrate the mutual misunderstanding is the different take on television genres. The problem was that the iMMix catalogue listed about 300 genres ranging from game show, quiz show, quiz, amusement, Amusement (with capital) and so on. These television genres contained subgenres, sub-subgenres and also labels media studies scholars do not use. The media researcher, therefore, wanted to make a new division of genres which better matched the needs of media researchers. She knew that media researchers really want to select and mix and match their own television genres. The computer scientist in the project perceived genre just as one of the many metadata fields of the television archive, just a facet, similar to producer or channel. This view really conflicted with that of the media researcher who considered genre as one of the backbones in film and television studies research. They had a long, persistent discussion about how the genres should be implemented in MeRDES.</p>
<p>MS: For me, it should be clear how the genres were related to the television programmes; so I wanted a separate visualization. For you, genre was just one metadata field. Negotiations ended up in keeping the metadata field genre, not in a separate visualization but as tab of the word cloud. (see <a href="#figure01">figure 1</a>)</p>
<p>CS: In the end, I wrote in our paper:  “genre is a very important concept in media studies” , just because all media researchers were insisting on it; during the focus groups, the interviews and you during the development. Genres had to be correct; that had to be precise.</p>
<p>The project members had a similar misunderstanding with snippet. It took about three months before they realized that they had a mutual misunderstanding about it. The computer scientist wanted to show snippets of television programmes in the interface. Result snippets are the short summaries of a document, designed to allow users to decide its relevance. Typically, a snippet consists of the document title and a short summary, which is automatically extracted <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>MS: Somehow I associated snippet with birds and twitter, as the words sound similar. And so I thought snippets were pop-ups or mouseovers. I did not understand why we needed them in the interface at that point. I could have benefited from a beginner’s course in information retrieval and search systems.</p>
<p>Indeed, the lack of semantic interoperability impeded the development of the tool as it costed time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the semantic gap also had its function: it forced the researchers to define terms and concepts, which enhances transparency and resulted in a better design of the interface. The collaboration was also supported by the fact that the media researcher moved cities and now lived in the same city as the computer scientist’s university campus. They met more regularly, in person, at the computer science campus which helped in decreasing the mutual misunderstandings. At the computer science campus, the media studies scholar also observed how the computer scientists work, in teams. She observed that they are less focused on individual research than humanities researchers are. It made her realize that the individualistic take of humanities is typical for the humanities, and is not necessarily the only way to go about research. She started to see her own situatedness.</p>
<p>The defining, crucial element for this research phase was the involvement of other humanities students and scholars in the project. These steps of involving  “users”  into the project was the key to increase the level of transdisciplinarity. The computer scientist explains:</p>
<p>CS: And then our first real thing: the development of MeRDES. We really had to find a strategy to collaborate. I really struggled with my own lack of understanding of your field on the one hand and that the users did not really know what they want on the other hand. We really have many techniques, that are very cool, but we had no clue whether our techniques are useful for media researchers. Media researchers know some techniques, such as google, but they do not know what is possible so they could not really suggest things.</p>
<p>MS: I did not realize how difficult it was for you. You had to grasp the particularities of Media Studies, while I just had to talk with peers – with similar background, lingua and education.</p>
<p>It was important to elaborate the group of users from one (the postdoc) to many. The focus group discussions had a double function: they were an efficient way to gather feedback on the prototype and a pleasant way to get to know the defining characteristics of Media Studies.</p>
<p>The user-centred tool development also triggered some difficulties. The computer scientist pinpointed the difficulty in the development of the tool as  “different views on the tool’s goal” .</p>
<p>CS: The major problem is that you and also the media researchers in our focus groups were more interested and fascinated by MeRDES as a tool for analysis than for retrieval. Our mutual misunderstandings were based on that. You and our users in the focus groups were always approaching MeRDES as a tool for analysis, as it generates statistics. I just regarded it as a tool for retrieval.</p>
<p>MS: I did not realize this back then. When I noticed that our target researchers raised some critical questions regarding the interface, I often explained it - to myself - that they did not yet see the full potential of computer sciences for the humanities. I now realize that addressing those critical questions  <em>within</em>  the interface is key.</p>
<p>The media researcher started to see her peers as  “other” , and felt more comfortable with the  “automated”  and  “quantitative”  aspect of their joint research project. She had started to build a bridge. In a later stage, the critical remarks of the researchers helped her to redesign the interface in a follow-up project.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>
<p>The remote user study with the 39 media scholars went well. However, it was difficult to interpret the results because humans provided the data: mouse clicks and survey results of 39 researchers. This meant that both researchers had to learn about human-computer interaction, a field which they were both not familiar with. For computer sciences, it is difficult to get sufficient statistical power as there was only a small dataset (39 respondents) while for humanities, online surveys do not always give satisfying information as they cannot ask follow-up questions and have in-depth interviews to grasp the interpretation strategies of the respondents. They realized that the interpretative element should get even more space in their next user study, as explained in the next section.</p>
<p>The researchers had a strong belief that more interpretative methods were required for the next user study. This belief was especially instigated by the parallel research step of conducting 27 in-depth interviews with media scholars. The interviews were conducted at the work space of the media researchers, so also had an ethnographic value for the computer scientist. The interviews were effective for the computer scientist to get an understanding of what the humanities is all about:</p>
<p>CS: Computer sciences is a really structured field. My first impression about media studies researchers was that they were quite absent-minded. So chaotic. Like how one of our interviewees explained it during an interview:  “then the data, the research question, and back” , while she was drawing imaginary loops on the table. And also during our conversations and our first think aloud study. Then you first wanted to do research on Eastern Europe, then on Russian children and then you ended up with research on Russian migrant children. Skipping from one subject to another. But later I understood that it is just part of an interpretative research process in which humanities researchers try to understand a subject.</p>
<p>While the method of conducting interviews is common in the field of media studies, for the computer scientist it was a new way of doing research. It also was a kind of  “social”  literature study:</p>
<p>CS: During the first interviews, I was totally puzzled about certain terms. They were talking about reception, audience studies, production, and texts. I was surprised to what extent culture is central and questioning what culture is, etc. I really did not understand what they meant.</p>
<p>The researchers gave a lot of examples about their research, which helped to understand the discipline-specific terms. The computer scientist learnt a lot of the specificities of media researchers. The media studies postdoc realized that her own (re)search behavior is very typical for Media Studies, which confirmed that her own stake in the project could be considered more or less as representative for media studies.</p>
<p>In this phase, a productive struggle, there were clear signs that both researchers started to build bridges. Semantics are one of the most defining parts of a discipline. Learning each other’s semantics is a conditio sine qua for a good, constructive collaboration. In addition, they got acquainted with - for their discipline - rather  “exotic”  methods: the computer scientist was enthusiastic about the focus group discussions for the tool development and the interviews to grasp the field of Media Studies. The media studies scholar started to see the value of computer sciences for the humanities. She was impressed by the efficiency of computer scientists, e.g. how they communicate and plan, and what they could achieve with technologies and programming. Both researchers started to learn new concepts, to understand the benefits and particularities of the other’s disciplines, and they both firmly believed in their joint project to build new tools for Media Studies researchers. One of the strategies which helped to increase collaboration was meeting more regularly and spending full working days in the same office, which makes it easier to ask questions and consult each other.</p>

<h2 id="71-description-of-the-research-process">7.1 Description of the research process</h2>
<p>The third and last phase could be regarded as a highlight in transdisciplinarity. The research went smoothly. For this phase, they again built and tested a new interface, but this time more qualitative methods were used for testing it. While MeRDES is really suitable for exploration within a single archive, in the last phase, we wanted to develop an interface for contextual research that links several heterogeneous audiovisual collections. We named the interface CoMeRDa (Contextualizing Media Researchers’ Data) (<a href="#figure02">figure 2</a>), and conducted two user studies to test it: a lab study with 44 students and a longitudinal study with 26 students.</p>
<p>The development of CoMeRDa went much better than MeRDES, although there was a more limited time frame. CoMeRDa enables simultaneous search in six collections: (i) a television program collection (metadatarecords for 700.000 programs, a selection of iMMix); (ii) a photo collection of television programmes; (iii) a wiki dedicated to television programmes and presenters; (iv) scanned television guides; (v) scanned newspapers starting from 1900 to 1995; and (vi) another newspaper collection from 1995 to 2005. The interface has three different tabs: basic search (search in one collection); combined search (search in six collections) and similarity search (search for similar documents across different collections). To test the interface two user studies have been conducted, i.e., one longitudinal and one laboratory.</p>
<p>The researchers conducted a laboratory study with 44 freshmen students of media and cultural studies. The students got three tasks: (i) imagine that you work at the editorial office of a current affairs program and are asked to collect information about celebrity X. Collect at least 5 items deemed to be relevant for this collection, (ii) search for events that were key in the career of celebrity X. Collect at least 5 items for this collection, for example articles and photographs, about these events, (iii) A key television program in the career of the celebrity X was program Y. Collect at least 5 items about the run-up to the program, the program itself, and the aftermath. To complete the first task subjects are provided with the tabbed display (one collection), for the second task with the blended display (all collections), and for the third task with the similarity display (similar documents in other collections).</p>
<p>The theme of the course selected for the longitudinal study is television and film history and the research projects carried out by the students are centred around television personalities between 1950s and 1980s. The 26 master students could use CoMeRDa for their research paper, which had to be a photo essay on a celebrity. Every second week, they were asked to complete a questionnaire on their use of CoMeRDa. Every other week, there was a focus group discussion in which the results of the questionnaire and their feedback on the interface were discussed. The multimethod user study showed that the students preferred the blended display in the first stage of their research project: they wanted to have an overview of what is available. As soon as they had picked a research topic, they preferred to search within one collection at a time. The results of these CoMeRDa user studies are published in <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="72-conversation-about-the-research-process">7.2 Conversation about the research process</h2>
<p>In CoMeRDa, the development was less difficult, also because it was a more straightforward interface. Negotations were rather about presentation and display, than about facets and metadata fields.</p>
<p>CS: During the development of CoMeRDa, we had a better collaboration. We could digitize a part of the programme guide collection as sample, and you were the one who knew best what kind of sample makes sense. The same goes for the newspaper collection; it went back to the 17th century, so you had to make decisions on how to streamline the collection with the television related collections.</p>
<p>MS: I knew what to expect and really enjoyed to work with a strict planning. I was more able to do last minute tasks. So for me it was a much easier phase than when we developed and tested MeRDES.</p>
<p>Indeed, as the team members all went already through the development and testing of MeRDES, the mutual expectations were levelled. The media studies researcher started not only to see how the innovations done by computer sciences need a structured way of working and a fast pace, but also to adopt some daily working protocols of computer sciences, and to use important computer science terms in the daily conversations. She just knew much better how to communicate.</p>
<p>Similarly, it was much easier to agree on the set-up of the user studies. The researchers agreed that the media studies researcher was the one who should  “translate”  the surveys and create realistic assignments for the students:</p>
<p>CS: Well, we had a lot of discussion about the questionnaires. Because you thought they were too long and the questions were not clearly formulated. I always wanted to have extensive questionnaires, while you knew that the students would not really enjoy filling extensive questionnaires. Surveys were always a point of conflict. But once we conducted the study, we were both enthusiastic about the set-up. We had a good task division.</p>
<p>The computer scientist decided what they were going to measure, for the computer science papers. And the media studies researcher translated the questionnaires from computer science to humanities language, made the assignments doable, and tailored the task and set-up to media studies research. The computer scientist recalls:  “Without you, it would have been a computer scientist who gave an assignment to media studies scholars. And then they would have had no clue about what to do.”</p>
<p>Moreover, it proved to be important to communicate  “live”  with each other and avoid written discussions.</p>
<p>CS: We still had some misunderstandings. We learnt that we better avoid to communicate via e-mail. If we started discussing via e-mail, the mutual misunderstandings piled up. Often, we had a meeting, and then you went home and started to think about it and wrote me an e-mail from home:  “It won’t work. We have to change the set-up” . And then I wrote back to you:  “No, we have to do it like this, we have to measure it!”</p>
<p>MS: Yes, we then realized we had to take the phone and talk it through instead of squirreling over mail.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>
<p>For the media studies postdoc, there was one major challenge in the software development. She was afraid that they were building tools that would not be used, as seems to be the case with the majority of tools developed by DH-projects (cf. Golumbia, 2013).</p>
<p>MS: For me, the most difficult part was that I, or better we, the media researchers, were also research subjects. I continuously had to keep in mind to not make a tool that was completely tailored to what I wanted. If I have to point at the true challenge for BRIDGE, in hindsight, it is the fact that as the humanities researcher of the project you have that double function. You have to be so self-reflexive: on the one hand you have to monitor that you are representing a large, diverse group of researchers, while at the same time you have to give feedback on a daily basis and do the research yourself. It was key that we conducted focus group discussions and so many interviews with different scholars at different institutes in different fields.</p>
<p>In the end, it turned out that the tools were appreciated by scholars and students. Of course, a lot of feedback was received and there is still some work to do to make the tools sustainable (see <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>). But in general, the research conducted in this phase was considered as satisfying for both scholars in the project. Right after the last focus group discussion with the students in the longitudinal session, all the pieces came together. We realized that we both learnt methods and practices of the other’s field.</p>
<p>CS: I also liked the fact that we chose for a more qualitative approach, in the longitudinal study. It gave so many insights. I really think that is one of the assets: that I learnt some of your methodologies and learnt about a humanities perspective. It is a fresh perspective for computer sciences.</p>
<p>MS: Same here. I believe that the key is in mixing both worlds: quantitative and qualitative methods. A bit of computer sciences and a bit of humanities, that is. For humanities, it is often - or better: traditionally - considered as  “superficial”  to base research solely on quantitative measurements. They tend to think: So what? What do the numbers tell us?. Humanities scholars need interpretation, culture and meaning. Basically: humans are central in all phases of their research process, as well as in defining their research object. However, bringing the humans into interface development and bringing interpretation into computer sciences is a very exciting new field for the humanities. So, I can not imagine anymore  <em>not</em>  to think a bit  “computer sciency”  myself.</p>
<p>Both researchers clearly crossed the bridge and felt quite comfortable in mixing paradigms and methods. If the researchers have to pick one challenge, however, these are the publication outlets. It is just very hard to read and understand each other’s papers.</p>
<p>CS: Humanities papers are very philosophical and theoretical. It is full of quotes of what people think about something cultural. It is very woolly, if you ask me. It questions your own interpretation. It is so vague because you use words that are not the concept itself. Instead, you use all kinds of difficult words, but not the concept itself because that is the one that you are trying to explain. I am not against such papers, I really like them, but we are not trained in reading them. It costs time and effort to understand. You gave me some books about how humanities do research, about cultural studies and cultural memory. And it really helped. We are not trained in interpretation. As a humanities researcher, you make your own interpretation of the data. That is totally new for us.</p>
<p>As most papers about the user studies are written within the computer science paradigm, the same is true for the humanities scholar. A true challenge was the writing of papers and articles collaboratively. In the beginning, it was one of the staff members who wrote and the other who commented and provided some paragraphs for the article. In the final year, they wrote an article together, with the collaborative software writeLaTeX.</p>
<p>CS: It was so fun to see that you enjoyed writing in writeLaTeX.</p>
<p>MS: What I really liked is that you can immediately see your paper in a nice lay-out as if it is already published. You see immediately the result in nicely lay-outed paper, which is much more satisfying than writing in a Word document. It was quite a challenge to learn the code, but it was very efficient.</p>
<p>Still, it is not easy to write together in terms of language, because computer sciences and humanities write for different audiences. The different journals and conferences need specific formats and styles. There is still a gap, which can only be bridged by new journals in the field of digital humanities.</p>
<p>Eventually, when the project was finished it was clear that both researchers appreciated and understood important aspects of the other discipline. The computer scientist could finish his PhD on time. The media studies scholar did not write a monograph, nor she could conduct research with the tools, as they were only ready when the project was finished. However, she learnt so much about interface development and computer sciences that she included many of the assets of computer sciences in her future humanities work.</p>
<p>Transdisciplinarity did arise, and the bridge was built. Even more so: after completion of the project, the media studies researcher started to work on a new project and interface, but from then on based at a computer science department. The computer scientist went in the opposite direction and started to work in a joint history-computer science project, based at a humanities department. The once so  “other”  discipline was from then on  “us” . The researchers did not only meet each other in the middle of the bridge; they even crossed the bridge in institutional terms. Admittedly not for long, as both researchers got career opportunities in the  “original”  discipline, and at the moment of publication work again in their  “own”  discipline of, respectively, Media Studies and Computer Sciences.</p>
<h2 id="8-conclusion-living-happily-together-ever-after">8 Conclusion: living happily together ever after?</h2>
<p>In this article, we explicitly chose to describe the challenges that arose within our research project. We viewed those challenges from two perspectives, by using a conversation structure between the two central staff members of the project. The conversation structure enabled us to write an article from two standpoints, and also to show how our standpoints shifted during the course of the project. As such, we embodied two disciplines, and showed how knowledge claims can be negotiated in the practice of a Digital Humanities research project. The researchers of two disciplines gradually gained mutual understanding.</p>
<p>After setting the scene of both disciplines, we identied three phases in the project. Similar to the common narrative of Hollywood films, there was first an encounter, then a struggle and conflict, and finally appeasement and a  “happy”  ending. Other research on interdisciplinary projects also found that the first phase of research is considered as    “frustrating”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  . Semantic interoperability, for instance, was a key problem in the first two stages of the project. We showed the frustrations, but also looked at the flipside of them: the semantic gap between the disciplines and the epistemological differences between disciplines often provided inspiration as they were key in lifting the veil of our own situatedness. In other words, we would like to acknowledge frustration as a facilitator of communication and transdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>The interaction and power relations continuously changed during the course of the project as knowledge at all levels increased. The researchers got more insight in the particularities of the other discipline’s field, thus developing a shared language and increasing semantic interoperability between the members of the production team. The computer scientist said that the slow pace of the humanities research was something they had to adjust to and changed their observation of media studies scholars along the way. The humanities scholar learnt to work with a (more) strict planning and also adopted technical language. In the project, it turned out that both disciplines learned the language of the other’s discipline, e.g. by reading literature, by discussing the disciplinary boundaries on a daily basis, by conversations and (ethnographic-style) observations.</p>
<p>Transdisciplinarity especially arose in the set-up of the user studies. It is in the user studies where epistemological encounters took place between the two disciplines. The user studies are, in other words, the space of negotiation where computer sciences and media studies really crossed. In BRIDGE, the computer scientist took care of the experimental set-up of the user studies, while the media studies scholar supervised the  “humanities-stake”  of the set-up, the assignments and the questionnaires for the humanities users. Moreover, the team conducted focus groups and interviews with prospective users, bringing qualitative, ethnographic methods into the common quantitative practice of computer scientists. It not only helped to learn about the other’s discipline, but also added an interpretative layer to the quantitative results. Especially in the user study with CoMeRDa, in which the team used a laboratory study next to a qualitative study, the merits of a triangulation of methods came to the fore. Vice versa, the media studies researcher gained insight in the development of a tool and learn about the specificities of developing digital tools for media studies.</p>
<p>The most important facilitators of the interface development, too, were the regular contact and interviews with the users, the group of media researchers. During the development of the tool, the users could direct the developers to desirable functionalities and the use of understandable labels. The interfaces MeRDES and CoMeRDa could not have been made without the encounter of the two disciplines, and the continuous negotiation between both. BRIDGE proved not only to build bridges between nodes of a television archive, but also between researchers and disciplines: a true actor-network in a Latourian sense. Extending the network from two researchers who collaborate (i.c. a computer scientist and a media studies scholar) to many scholars was one of the key success factors of the project.</p>
<p>The project required both the computer science researcher and the humanities researcher to learn about the tools, techniques, and methodological practices of the other discipline and find a common research direction in which the strengths of both disciplines could be utilized. This required not only effort in becoming adept at another discipline’s practices but also overcoming a psychological barrier, i.e., abandoning something you are good at to become an apprentice in another field. These, together with the misunderstandings and frustrations that accompany co-operating with someone with a different background, are obstacles which should not be underestimated, especially with regards to the (anxieties about) careers of the researchers involved. Institutions, therefore, play a vital role in the enhancement of Digital Humanities and should carefully look at the assessment procedures for tenure, and specifically the assessment of digital publications such as tools and databases.</p>
<p>Researchers should have some of both worlds in their training, one could argue, or at least being able to move in between the different spaces so as to support an understanding of each other’s discourses. As <sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> point out, this is of vital importance for effective interaction and a condition for innovation, no matter how complex the network of actors for such innovative performance is. <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> state that there is an increasing number of individuals who have real competence in both domains, but that these are rare. What we want to stress is that there is still a lot of scholarship needed on user-centred tool development and on methods for digital tool-education such as the training of Digital Tool Criticism within the humanities.</p>
<p>Also, a problem arose in the physical distance of the project’s members. Scholars are initially distanced in terms of paradigms and distanced in terms of physical presence. E-mail conversations were bound to end up in conflicts. Working in the same space, or at least having regular meetings or conversations, is essential for a good progress of the project. This is simple advice, but highly effective.</p>
<p>A persistent problem, however, are publications. As long as the academic publication outlets are centered in one or the other field, it remains a true challenge to write for a journal of which the format, language and paradigms are not yours. Even with this article it is admittedly the humanities scholar who chose the constructionist theoretical framework and approach. The conversation structure was used as it allowed us to cope with the different paradigms and the different voices of the authors. Still, it was quite a challenge to write this article from two perspectives in terms of words and style.</p>
<p>For a future project, it would be nice to include a third perspective or voice, this of the heritage partner or data provider, and also differentiate views within groups, by e.g. including the perspective of the software developer. In this case, it would be necessary to conduct individuel interviews or focus groups with all participants throughout the project and document these carefully. For long-term projects, the problem might be that participants leave the project or (re)join which makes it difficult to write a joint article and to keep track of all different voices in the article. In any case, we advise DH-projects to document their collaboration and have (at least) annual meta-discussions about each other and the project.</p>
<p>Last, reflection requires at least a moment of distance. It would not only be difficult but even impossible to write this article during the course of the project. By that time, we were pre-occupied with reaching our goals, developing the tools on time, setting up the user studies and writing up the papers. Only now can we look back at BRIDGE and reflect on the persons we were in the beginning of the project. We are aware of the fact that in this article we are open about our own  “selves”  and attitudes during the project. However, we firmly believe that transparency is not only key to research methods and digital tools but also to scholarship as such. Disciplinary-defined clouds keep on mystifying poles. We have built a bridge, walked on it, but are still attracted to the end of the pole we were educated in. So, the happy end of the project is rather an open ending. Digital Humanities, therefore, is not so much about the results (how does the movie end?) but about acknowledging that it is a process of which all elements — the researchers, the interfaces, the methods and the semantics — are interconnected and can view and be viewed from multiple perspectives.</p>

<h2 id="digital-enumerative-bibliography-as-preservation-of-feminist-labor">Digital Enumerative Bibliography as Preservation of Feminist Labor</h2>
<p><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br>
In 2014, Michelle Levy asked,  “Do Women Have a Book History?”  She continues that Robert Darnton’s <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> influential communication circuit is  “silent on the question of gender”  and    “too rigid to capture the full range of women’s involvement in the production and dissemination of literary writing even during the print era”   <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  . This question is one that resonates more widely, especially for feminist book historians who encounter a wide range of literature that is rich in its history of production processes, readings of bibliographic objects, and histories of circulation and reception, but largely  “silent”  about gender. Levy’s question is indicative of the key issue with women’s book history: despite significant work in the field, there is no narrative, no central theses or arguments that join together the diverse body of work on women’s work and labor. The phrase women’s book history is itself rare, as it appears less than ten times in the scholarship that we have located. This had led many to believe that the answer to Levy’s question might be no, or perhaps not yet.  </p>
<p>In response, we began to gather data in the form of secondary source citations in an enumerative bibliography on the intersection of women’s lives and book history. In 2016, this became the  <em>Women in Book History Bibliography</em>  ( <em>WBHB</em> ). The  <em>WBHB</em>  is an open-access bibliography that, in its earliest iteration, used lists generated in Zotero to create listings of sources which intersected with our definitions of women and book history, which were clustered in established subfields like authorship, manuscript studies, reading, and the book trades. We began this project because, similarly to the question that motivated Levy’s article, we had an issue with a lack of a clear disciplinary history to pull from in our dissertation research on early modern English print culture. We hoped that by sharing secondary sources we could help others as we helped each other. Thanks to a generous grant from what is now the Center of Digital Humanities Research (CoDHR) at Texas A&amp;M University, in 2017 we transitioned the bibliography to a MySQL database with a front end written in Django. We capitalized on the capabilities of a relational database to include filters that allow users to isolate sources by tags including geographic location, language, year, author, and a more robust list of subfields that includes archival studies, digital media, LGBTQ+, critical race theory, and indigeneity.</p>

<p>This platform promotes ongoing work in women’s book history by making scholarship and resources on women&rsquo;s writing and labor visible. Collecting data, making this work  “count”  by writing it into the historical record, is a feminist act that preserves the past while shaping the future. When we first launched the site, we were not prepared for the enthusiastic response, nor that this project was a visible indicator of a growing pushback against what one might think of as  “traditional”  bibliography, the field that grew from the work of W.W. Greg, Fredson Bowers, and G. Thomas Tanselle. Bibliography as a discipline has its origins in studies on the Bible and Shakespeare, and has, historically, not focused on women’s experiences nor those of other under-represented subject positions and genres. Considering the development of women’s book history alongside black bibliography, queer bibliography, the postcolonial and indigenous book, and the global book suggests that one future of digital and material studies is as an activist discourse with deep ties to critical theory.</p>
<p>To explore the latter possibility, this essay uses the example of our digital enumerative bibliography to demonstrate that feminist approaches to digital humanities and book history have much to offer the recovery of women’s literary history and promote its ongoing construction. They work together to create new methodologies and revise existing structures to correctly position women’s contributions to textual production in a historically and materially accurate context. While our larger concerns are on the history of the book, this article’s primary focus is on bibliographic methods for feminist intervention. We use bibliography’s epistemological work as a revisionist methodology that counteracts patriarchal structures as it reorganizes itself around feminist ones. Secondly, we look at the larger implications of data gathering on the epistemology of book history and draw conclusions about what a feminist historiography reveals about women’s history and studies on the book. Lastly, we touch on the structural implications of working on marginal subjects while being precariously employed. This dual precarity adds an urgency to the responsible preservation of digital literary recovery efforts, and we provide a roadmap for thinking through these issues.</p>
<h2 id="digital-enumerative-bibliography">Digital Enumerative Bibliography</h2>
<p>Our feminist approach to revising the narrative of book history centers on bibliography. It is an important ancestor to book history, as one aspect of the field grew from debates in textual and historical bibliography in the 1970s and 1980s <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Similarly, Amy E. Earhart <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> argues that digital humanities pulls from bibliography in its methods and some of its more conservative ideologies that have prioritized work on white male literary subjects.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  Intervening within these narratives allows us to repurpose bibliography in both material and digital iterations of the book history <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The  <em>WBHB</em>  began as a simple enumerative bibliography, as this was the most familiar tool to solve a common problem — finding and organizing sources around a central topic. Enumerative bibliographies are accessible for both creators and users. Every scholar has experience with them as references at the end of articles and books. They not only let a researcher collect data, but present it in a hierarchy that suggests importance and the relationships of textual data <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Enumerative bibliography is a deceptively simple form that can seemingly be done with little critical thought: adopting a common citation style and plugging information into a reference manager can generate a bibliography in seconds. These lists are simple, but they are powerful. They are the tools    “for which the non-bibliographer breathes a silent prayer of thanks whenever beginning a new research project”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  . Its influence on field-building and encouraging future scholarship is substantial. For example, in the early twentieth century African-American literary scholars like Dorothy B. Porter used enumerative bibliography to establish the field as a legitimate discourse <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. In short, bibliographic lists become the first step towards canon development, and from there to actual disciplinary creation.</p>
<p>Our project pulls directly from this tradition, but it uses a digital format to create a dynamic and adaptive version of static numbered lists that we refer to as  <em>digital enumerative bibliography</em> . Similarly to projects like  <em>The Science Fiction and Fantasy Research Database</em>  and the  <em>World Shakespeare Bibliography</em> , the  <em>WBHB</em>  takes the foundational basics of organization from enumerative bibliography but presents it in a digital format through a relational database, with additional search functions and the ability to organize objects by relevant metadata. Enumerative bibliography’s print-focused history is not erased in this process but reimagined around one of bibliography’s key concepts: purpose. Gregson Bowers argues that bibliography is intimately connected to data’s imagined purpose. He believes that to collect information for the sake of itself would only make bibliography    “a limited science”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  . To meet users’ needs of referencing material that is otherwise uncollected, we still use the visuals of a printed bibliography on the front end to help users encounter data in familiar ways. We have also retained the taxonomies of a print-based bibliography as an organizational structure by using the same fields that a citation generator like Zotero would use: author, title, publisher, and year. </p>
<p>Digital enumerative bibliography moves beyond these organizational structures, however. It allows us to think about historiography as data. The underlying infrastructure of a relational database shifts the framework from Harmon’s bibliographic hierarchy to a nexus of interconnected data that surrounds a core organizing function — the title of a secondary source. As Stephen Ramsay writes, databases cover a wealth of    “fascinating problems and intellectual opportunities”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>   that are of interest to bibliographers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inclusion of certain data (and the attendant exclusion of others), the mapping of relationships among entities, the often collaborative nature of dataset creation, and the eventual visualization of information patterns, all imply a hermeneutics and a set of possible methodologies that are themselves worthy objects for study and reflection.<br>
<sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digital enumerative bibliography incorporates these possibilities into the existing epistemological work of disciplinary lists. Databases can supplement standard bibliographic data by tracking information that is normally latent rather than explicit in common citation styles, such as format of publication; a citation format will change based on if it is a journal article or book, but most humanities citation styles do not explicitly include format. Our database’s taxonomy does. There is consequently a shift in thinking about bibliographic data’s use beyond pointing to sources for further reading. It allows us to ask questions about our field by what language we use to title our sources and where, when, and in what format we publish. Further, databases allow for extraction of these individual pieces of data as they meet changing criteria based on users’ interests, which a static list does not. This means that digital enumerative bibliography facilitates new kinds of research than print-focused versions.</p>

<p>Historiography choices in the  <em>WBHB</em>  are expressed through those sources we go out of our way to find and what subfields we index in and by what criteria. As Daniel V. Pitti observes, it is difficult to reduce the complexities of historical and material documents to the constraints of database design <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. However, queries plugged into a well-designed database can    “reveal intellectual relations between unique entities, but also between categories or classes of entities based on shared characteristics”   <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  . We designed the  <em>WBHB</em>  to uncover  “intellectual relations”  in the shared characteristics of language, geography, subject, and time period for our sources. For example, analyzing sources in the database that focus on manuscript or print shows that there is a distinct shift in scholarly emphasis from manuscript to print in the English Renaissance. This is an important tool for the feminist book historian studying English literature, as a point of interest is that the rise of print was a shift toward a form of textual production that favored male writers for many years <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. As another example, sorting the database by the LGBT+ tag shows that most of the sources we have located in this area focus on late-twentieth century periodicals in the United States, and there is a dearth of pre-modernist scholarship in English on queer identities and the material book or a queered production of the book. While one must be careful about making broad arguments based on an artificial construction of sources, these searches nevertheless indicate that expanding enumerative bibliography to the full relational potential of a database allows scholars to ask dramatically more expansive questions about our field and how it is practiced.</p>
<p>Gathering sources around an idea for which there is no critical consensus is a deeply ideological act that can influence how users will conceptualize the field moving forward. All of our subfield editorial choices are political, even more so than the explicit idea of a bibliography that is focused on women. By asking questions like  <em>what field is this a part of?</em>  we are imagining audiences’ interests and shaping the kinds of research we would like to facilitate on our website. Our choices are intentionally intersectionally feminist. And because users can download the database and run their own analyses, the data can be used in ways we have not yet imagined as well. Thus, the most exciting avenue of research in digital enumerative bibliography is that users can reinterpret the data through queries and outputs that the static hierarchy of a list might otherwise prohibit. </p>
<h2 id="tracking-a-womens-history-of-the-book">Tracking a Women’s History of the Book</h2>
<p>Just as the  <em>Database of Early English Playbooks</em>  facilitates different research questions than W. W. Greg’s  <em>A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration</em>   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, the digital database of the  <em>WBHB</em>  allows users to ask new questions about studies of the book and implicit values. These queries reveal trends, patterns, and overlaps about both book history (as a digital and material practice) and feminist literary studies. This section details what we found by analyzing data in the  <em>WBHB</em>  and suggests that a feminist collection of scholarship on the material and digital book challenges the idea of book history as separate from gender. </p>
<p>A feminist approach to cataloguing information on women’s interactions with the book is necessary because most major publications in book studies neglect these experiences. For example, women’s work is poorly or narrowly represented across book history companions and readers. The massive  <em>Oxford Companion to the Book</em>   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> has no space — or entries — for Gender,  Women,  Race,  Sex, nor does its mass-market counterpart  <em>The Book: A Global History</em>   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. As these books are not exceptions but representative examples, it is clear that too many studies in the field of book history reiterate its oldest sins in emphasizing the experiences and works of white, Anglo-European, cis-het men. </p>
<p>In contrast to this absence, the 1,550 sources in the  <em>WBHB</em>  make a convincing case that while work on women in book history may be discursively marginal, it is not meager in number. Analyzing this dataset allows us to isolate two challenges to the male-centric state of book studies. First, we can interrogate with more accuracy and force the assumption of our subjects’ marginality. The sources in the  <em>WBHB</em>  suggest that while women are on the margins in comparison to the wealth of information on male subjects and their texts, it is less clear that they were marginal  <em>historically</em> . Rather than reflecting historical accuracy, our modern scholarship is driven by the implicit value of male-driven authorship and production as reflected in the Oxford editions. The  <em>WBHB</em>  data instead allows us to revise some of our key arguments about women and textual production, even those that grow from a feminist desire to conceptualize this experience. As an example, Leslie Howsam wrote in her groundbreaking 1998 article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important … to remark on something that is concealed by thematic theoretical models: most of the women whose work in the book cycle has been so painstakingly discovered by researchers have been atypical individuals, outstanding anomalies in a cultural field dominated by men. Most publishers and editors have been men; the majority of writers of scholarly, legal, and theological and political works were men; printing trade workers at all levels were almost always men … For the most part, what [Lucien] Febvre and [Henri-Jean] Martin called  “the little world of the book”  has been a male domain.<br>
<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Howsam&rsquo;s essay reflects a field that was still recovering women writers, much less women’s labor in roles like hawking that were less valued than property-owning members of the trade like booksellers <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Since 1998, projects like the  <em>Perdita Manuscripts, Orlando</em> , and the  <em>Women Writers Project</em>  have added to our knowledge of women’s writing and textual production, and a significant branch of scholarship has grown from these resources. In the years since Howsam’s essay was published, much more has been discovered about textual production in general and about women’s roles specifically, and long-standing scholarship has been brought back into the light. As an example, Bell <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>, Smith <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, and Coker <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> have troubled the male-dominated narrative of the early modern book trades, instead painting a picture of women’s involvement in all aspects of print production. Women’s labor is harder to identify than the booksellers whose names appear on title pages, but it nevertheless exists. Printers’ wives and daughters managed shops and were bookkeepers <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, and widows ran powerful businesses. But women were not just wives and widows <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. They were feminist activists, printing as a way to reclaim agency <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> and building on a culture of women printers <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. They used print to give voice to marginalized communities <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This brief account of feminist book history scholarship falls short of the breadth and depth of the field, as it is largely limited to women and print in early modern England and the United States, the area where we primarily focus and which the sources in the  <em>WBHB</em>  database best represent. Yet even this limited case study makes visible an important revision. It is no longer certain that women were historically marginal in that they were a group so small they were hardly worth mentioning. Rather, they were continually present in the making, writing, and reading of books. Women have been, as Howsam phrases it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>identified at every node in the cycle and at all periods in history, from the printers’ widow operating independently in the circuit guilds of early modern Europe to the avid readership of romance novels, not to mention a strong tradition of women’s writing … Others perform the invisible but essential services of publishers’ readers, translators, designers, copy-editors, and indexers.<br>
<sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a point that has been reiterated by Helen Smith <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, Bell <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>, and Levy <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> — that women have always been physically present if not always leaving material traces that are as easily identifiable. What the sources in the  <em>WBHB</em>  emphasize is that women’s experiences are much harder to grasp and more likely to slip by as invisible labor. </p>
<p>This is a position that women share with other subjects on the margins and in between categories, and it may then be possible to use digital enumerative bibliographies to fill in gaps and silences in parallel ways to those who reconstruct lost voices in the archives. As Lauren F. Klein demonstrates with James Hemmings <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>, data visualization and mapping can capture lost histories and combat the forces of erasure that leave important histories behind. What the  <em>WBHB</em>  suggests is that the visualization and analysis of secondary sources can also uncover important trends about how scholarship on marginal figures slips in and out of our value systems. Often  “recovery efforts”  begin with the assumption that something is lost only to discover it was just overlooked, hiding in plain sight. Collecting and analyzing secondary sources on women and the book has shown us this is the case with book history. </p>
<p>Consequently, the second contribution that analyzing a database of secondary sources on a marginal topic yields is that we can identify  <em>how</em>  these subjects became marginal in contemporary discourses. To challenge our own conceptions of the field, we approach sources through a generous taxonomy and metadata structure. If the scholarly source is about women or women-identifying subjects in a substantial way, and intersects with areas of interest to book historians (categorized through the  “Fields”  section of the database), it is included. While there are still value judgments in this process, they are more transparent when one strips away obscuring language and the heavy weight of what is  “really”  book history. Often work that is within book history in its methods or approach does not use the phrase book history, just as work that is interested in racial power structures does not always signal itself as critical race theory. By looking at what a source  <em>does</em>  instead of how it positions itself, we have found many more items than anticipated and consequently have had to rethink our definitions of such seemingly concrete ideas as  <em>women, the book, textual production, and authorship.</em>  Because of its generous approach to source indexing, the  <em>WBHB</em>  connects sources on women printers in Renaissance Italy to the feminist zines of the late twentieth century in the U.S. to contemporary fantasy print culture in Korea, because all of it is produced by women. The sheer variety and depth of scholarship in this area sits in sharp contrast to how little the field considers the diversity of sources in its major narratives. </p>
<p>In other words, to find information on women and the book we had to adjust our assumptions from a field-specific approach to a labor-specific approach. As a result, the data this approach yields suggests one reason that women are difficult to identify in general book history scholarship is a byproduct of the field’s methodological and discursive practices. Anglo-American men are the numerical majority of subjects and are more likely to have their experiences recorded in accessible ways: papers in archives, surviving letters, published memoirs. Since book history itself privileges these documents, men’s experiences dominate how the field is understood. Furthermore, the language of book history, by design, obscures the subject in favor of the object of study and the process by which the object came into being <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. The unintentional result of this practice is that it is easy to overlook what kinds of subjects are privileged and how the objects of study may be more queered, gendered, and raced than is generally acknowledged.</p>
<p>Working within and against these discursive practices has an impact on scholars who research women and the book. Looking at the  <em>MLA International Bibliography</em> , one can get a sense of some of these issues. We selected two popular subjects as test cases: the book trades and authorship. To keep the numbers at a manageable rate, we also added England as a search term for both. On the  <em>MLA</em> , searching for the book trade and England yields 314 results.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  Adding in the search term women narrows the number down to 16, not all of which are about women subjects. If one replaces women with men, there are nine sources, even fewer than that of women. This leaves 290 sources that are unmarked by gender. One finds something similar with authorship. Authorship and England yields 323 results, which is narrowed to 49 by including the search term women. An additional 19 are indexed with men. Alternative search terms such as gender do not add to these numbers in significant ways. In both cases, a small proportion of sources are indexed by gender of any presentation. </p>
<p>Looking through the remaining sources that are not indexed by the gender of their subject leads to inevitable fatigue. Rarely do women appear in general histories, as the Oxford editions emphasize, and while men’s experiences can be very enlightening for studies on women, they are only occasionally written in a way that acknowledges the limitations of their conclusions. That is, without the presence of non-male subjects, it is uncommon to find an interrogation of the various levels of privilege and authority historical subjects experience that could indicate how women and other minorities fit into these narratives. </p>
<p>This may be true for many fields, but it seems a particularly apt characterization of how book history discusses its subjects. The sources we have found on women and the book indicate that when faced with this reality, work on women tends to flag itself as participating in an alternative discourse — it includes the words women,  women’s, or gender in the title or as a keyword. More than 60% of the sources in the  <em>WBHB</em>  are marked by this language. In book history scholarship, to tell the story by women is to  <em>position</em>  it as the story of women. The same cannot be said of scholarship on male subjects, which, as the  <em>MLA</em>  examples demonstrate, rarely identifies itself as only about men. It seems that women are either gendered or ignored. As more information is uncovered about women’s roles in the history of the book, this positioning may be less useful than it has been. Future studies of women’s book history may be able to locate with more authority and nuance where the gender of their subjects is and is not a factor in the production of text, as well as when it is a hindrance versus when it is a boon. And as our current society interrogates the usefulness of gender and sex as categories, it is likely that these characterizations will increasingly be assigned to performative categories rather than human features, a further de-evolution from the author-centric model of textual studies.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>
<p>The examples from the  <em>MLA</em>  replicate a common experience for many researchers, but they also point to a different issue of access: access to the secondary sources. There is a large set of issues surrounding access to secondary work that mimic the challenges of primary sources: paywalls and database subscriptions, the high cost of limited run academic books, and the complicated ethics of services like  <em>Academia.edu</em>  that tentatively facilitate sharing of information. Another is just finding the sources one is looking for to begin with. This is especially true when comparing what is on the  <em>MLA</em>  with what actually exists in the field, especially when that field’s definition and values are still unformed. As an example, we compared the sources in the  <em>MLA</em>  to what we have been able to collect in the  <em>WBHB</em> , and the difference is marked. Since all our sources include women, we filtered by England and the subject. For the book trades, our filters yield 178 sources. Compared to the 16 sources that researchers are assured of having from the  <em>MLA</em> , this is a significant improvement. Filtering by authorship yields a similar result: while the  <em>MLA</em>  offered 49 sources for women’s authorship in England, the  <em>WBHB</em>  has 356.<br>

It is true that no database, including the  <em>WBHB</em> , is perfect in its comprehensive surveillance of its intended topic, despite its best efforts. It is also true that the ways in which the  <em>MLA</em>  indexes sources inhibits visibility when it comes to English women and the book trades and authorship. The disparity between the  <em>WBHB</em>  and the  <em>MLA</em>  suggests a key difference in indexing practices. According to its online guidelines, the  <em>MLA</em>  employs a very broad vocabulary of 68,000 words used by a team of professional indexers and selected field bibliographers <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. The  <em>MLA</em>  also appears to not retroactively allow keywords to change (nor can we imagine many authors would find value in re-indexing dated scholarship). These are practical decisions, but they mean that listed sources do not always reflect how current scholarship is categorized and understood. Book history is an interdisciplinary field, so it is logical that authors and indexers may not always select the same terms that would link together studies that are truly on the same topics. Scholars may be participating in studies of book history implicitly rather than explicitly (as noted above), or pieces may have been published in an emerging discourse that now goes by another name. Since book history is a relatively new term for a broad and complicated field, it is not wholeheartedly embraced by its practitioners who may see the term as a needless derivative of historical bibliography, limited in its emphasis on the book as a printed codex, oddly fetishizing the material in an increasingly digital world, or less precise for a dozen other reasons. In short, what the field lacks is a set of values that is reflected in a lack of a centralized taxonomy.</p>
<p>This reality is one that book history shares with other  “newer”  disciplines and those that are built on the shifting but powerful interpretations that come from cross-disciplinary work, such as the digital humanities and critical theory. Scholars posing new or differently organized inquiries must do the work of field-building, they must make their own roadmaps, and their own    “citational chains”   <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  . These  “citational chains”  are historical, but they are also formative and impact the perception of the field moving forward. The  <em>WBHB</em>  suggests that digital enumerative bibliography can incorporate the kind of flexible and adaptable indexing practices to address access issues, as well as those that hide women’s work in generalized language. The centralized taxonomy of the  “Fields”  list requires subjective editorial intervention, which opens the project up to the murkier areas of bibliographic science. However, users’ ability to filter by empirical data as well as complete full-text searches should ameliorate issues introduced by organizational choices. </p>
<p>One project cannot fully alleviate the issues of looking for women in studies that often neglect their histories, and our dataset has its own blind spots, specifically our disciplinary backgrounds and focus on white women in England. However, we do believe that there is power in being counted if for no other reason than it eliminates the perception of work on women and the book as a small and marginal discourse. This points to one of the biggest contributions that digital enumerative bibliography offers fields in formation: the recovery of a history hiding in plain sight. To collect it is to    “acknowledge the debt to those who came before; those who helped us find our way when the way was obscured because we deviated from the paths we were told to follow”   <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  . </p>
<h2 id="precarious-histories-and-labor">Precarious Histories and Labor</h2>
<p>Collecting secondary sources reveals trends about both our primary subjects and our scholarly treatment of them, our historiography. This project has also foregrounded that issues of access and precarity are not just limited to the sources we index, but the larger infrastructure of digital bibliographic research on marginal subjects and texts. </p>
<p>The  <em>WBHB</em>  has also made clear that issues of access are central to this work, specifically access to secondary sources. While Mandell, Earhart, and others correctly argue that digital recovery efforts are essential to the establishment of minority authors in the literary canon, our project suggests that another step in the digital recovery process, beyond access to primary sources, is greater access to secondary sources. Scholarship becomes discourses, discourses become emergent narratives in monographs and anthologies. Without including secondary sources in recovery efforts, what work there is remains a silent niche rather than a sub-field or even a discipline in its own right. Dominant dialogues remain in place and are functionally re-canonized <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This is particularly relevant given the culture wars in academe that have likewise been ongoing since the 1980s and revolve around what constitutes the canon inside the classroom. Canon upholds values of scholarship, and the traditional — until recently, at least — exclusion of writers that are not dead white men has been a crux for both professors and students. While our focus in this essay and elsewhere has been on women writ large (where applicable, we adhere to a constructionist view of female identities), it must not be overlooked that much of the work that has been done so far has been limited to America and Europe. While book history is beginning to look beyond Anglo-European print culture, we particularly want to look forward to studies that genuinely encompass a global perspective rather than giving lip-service to a particular set of strictures and structures.</p>
<p>Building and maintaining the  <em>WBHB</em>  also reveals that digital bibliography on precarious subjects can be compounded by the precarity of our own labor. Establishing a digital project while precariously employed creates a substantial set of hurdles, even if these are experiences we share with many other digital humanists <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. When the  <em>WBHB</em>  was launched in 2016, we were both doctoral candidates in English at Texas A&amp;M University with little access to the funding and long-term support that digital scholarship, like any scholarship, needs. Due to timing, neither of us was able to incorporate the project explicitly into our dissertations, leading us to produce dissertations  <em>and</em>  several iterations of a digital project with all the associated headaches and challenges. Until spring 2018, when one editor secured stable employment, it was unclear if the  <em>WBHB</em>  would outlast our graduate student statuses; we were unable to imagine affording the site maintenance and the time it takes to add sources while adjuncting or doing repeated runs on the job market. </p>
<p>As Christina Boyles, Anne Cong-Huyen, Carrie Johnston, Jim McGrath, and Amanda Phillips argue, the labor of digital humanities is by its nature precarious, built on short-term grants and hope that assessment accurately takes into account digital work in a monograph-driven tenure system <sup id="fnref1:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. The  <em>WBHB</em>  is no different. The initial project cost a few hundred dollars to buy the domain and the associated costs to run the website for one year. We sorted and produced citation lists through Zotero, which is open-access software. One editor received unexpected supplemental income through the Beth Qualls Endowed Fellowship, which she was able to divert toward the creation of the site. Without the generosity of this donor and the luck of winning this fellowship, the website probably would not exist. Even a couple hundred dollars a year is significant for a graduate student stipend where one is balancing reimbursement, tuition fees and other university costs, and irregular summer funding. Paying out of pocket was not a system we would be able to maintain, especially when one considers the cost of the coding classes and software subscriptions that are necessary to advance beyond Zotero. </p>
<p>There were no mechanisms at the time to ask for funding from our home university, since maintenance costs do not fit neatly into any pre-existing category of graduate student funding.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  Unable to think of traditional means of securing funding, we took an unconventional approach: selling themed merchandise. Through a link on the site and social media accounts, we promote a digital storefront that sells items on a third-party website, from which we receive $2–$5 depending on the cost of the item. The designs were donated by a generous partner.</p>

<p>Beyond our expectations, these sales have generated enough funding to pay for site fees in 2018 and 2019, meaning that we have funded our digital humanities project through t-shirts, coffee mugs, and tote bags. Initially, we had some reservations about the appearance of potentially monetizing the site, as well as admitting we had not secured a prestigious line of funding that was common on comparable and aspirational projects. However, we soon found that fellow scholars were not only glad to contribute to our crowdfunding through purchases, but proud to do so: we have observed academics both familiar and unknown, at national and international conferences, sporting our t-shirts, putting our stickers on their phones and laptops, and writing in our notebooks. Women’s book history is not only an emerging field, it is a community that signposts its goals and affiliations through material goods as well as scholarship.</p>
<p>This process may not be iterable for those without a handy graphic designer and a generous social media following, but the challenges that prompted our move to crowdfunding are ones that tend to be shared amongst those who begin digital humanities projects without access to institutional support. Beyond the challenges of acquiring skills and finding the time to build a project that may not be assessed on the same level as a journal article, there are legitimate reservations about making visible funding sources that are less than prestigious. Projects that do this reveal their own precarity, and there is value that we culturally and professionally place on sources for funding that can affect tenure and promotion, reputation, and respect. Further, crowdfunding and other non-traditional funding sources can exacerbate the lack of stability that Boyles et al. identify. This position has real consequences. As Laura C. Mandell demonstrates, the  “do-it-yourself”  model of digital humanities work has yielded a list of dead links and half-finished projects from the 1990s on women writers <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. These sites are cautionary tales of project planning and maintenance management.</p>
<p>As Mandell’s analysis emphasizes, the experience of the  <em>WBHB</em>  does not suggest that crowdfunding should replace traditional, institutionally funded projects because of the associated stability that tends to come with supported scholarship. Instead, it argues that institutions and scholars with secure employment must extend those protections to new digital humanities projects if they encourage their students to pursue such work. What helped the  <em>WBHB</em>  move from Zotero lists to a database was the support of full-time faculty at Texas A&amp;M who used their influence to secure us practical training, server space, and mentoring. Through a technical assistance grant in 2017, Mandell and the Center of Digital Humanities Research (CoDHR) provided a programmer to convert the database from a MySQL shell into the front end we now use. CoDHR also pledged server space, which alleviated one of the biggest issues projects face and more than anything else ensured the database would continue to survive. </p>
<p>Without senior scholars advocating for their students and graduate programs providing long-term support, more projects will not make the transition from graduate student work to sustainability. A sea of new dead links may appear in articles from 2019. When these links are, as Mandell points to, connected to activist scholarship that recuperates marginalized histories and made by precariously employed scholars, the likelihood of this possibility exponentially increases. These dead links will match the sea of dissertations from scholars who were unable to find secure employment and thus never built on such work, a generation of brain power lost to the adjunct crisis. As the academic job market in library sciences and literary studies continues to decline and the future of the National Endowment for the Humanities remains uncertain, the burden is on individual institutions to invest long-term support in projects to keep this data and labor from being lost as much as we have called on them to ethically support their graduates’ employment. </p>
<p>Disrupting institutional systems of precarity and access is not the work of a single project, but digital enumerative bibliography can, when managed correctly, disrupt historiographies and recover some of the feminist history lost to the sea of dead links. The historiography we are uncovering in these sources has distinct activist roots; it largely comes from the work of second-wave and third-wave feminism and feminist literary recovery efforts. Of the 1,550 sources currently in the database, around 95% are from 1970 forward, when these movements began to gain traction and produce substantial amounts of scholarship on women and gender. While we hope to find more sources from earlier in the twentieth century, it will involve reimagining, somewhat, our mission of collecting primarily scholarly criticism. Women subjects were less common in the  “canon”  of literary criticism, which was challenged through the feminist movement. And prior to the later twentieth century, the number of women scholars in universities was drastically lower. Since the vast majority of the authors in our database are women-identified, it is statistically unlikely we will find the kind of sources we look for before 1930. We may have to adjust our methods of accounting.</p>
<p>Feminist literary recovery sought to    “bring long-lost women writers and their works to light, to bring them into scholarly discourse, and to make their works available to students and scholars”   <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  . The work in the  <em>WBHB</em>  is from all three of these foci, especially the last which spawned sustained discussions of feminist textual editing and canon formation. Collecting sources from feminist literary recovery has allowed us to get a picture of the methods and values of this movement as it intersects with material culture. Just as Ezell’s  <em>Writing Women’s Literary History</em>  [1993] took seriously the impact of feminist literary criticism, this project demonstrates that preserving and analyzing this data can point to the contributions and absences of the movements. The data proves some of the assumed biases of studies in material culture, including the privileging of print over manuscript, public writing over domestic, and what is defined as literary over technical or vocational. </p>
<p>Quantitative confirmation of gaps and silences reiterates that even recovery efforts can be limited in scope by ideological barriers. Lillian S. Robinson describes one such obstacle as the desire to recover women’s writing only of a certain sort — what could be described as proto-feminist or maps onto contemporary feminist values. Robinson wonders    “ <em>Is</em>  there a place for research — criticism and scholarship — on women’s literature that, while not being explicitly anti-feminist, nonetheless is not explicitly feminist either?”   <a href="#robinson1987">emphasis original</a>  . Robinson argues that given the widespread prejudices against women writers in both curriculum and in the scholarship, the answer had to be yes on the grounds that just working on a woman writer was a feminist act in and of itself. We can extend this philosophy to advocate for more work on women’s writing in manuscript, in private, and in non-literary genres. But it also reaches women on the margins of textual production, those who perform occasionally unremarkable but nevertheless universal labor. For instance, mercuries was the gendered term for women distributing pamphlets in the eighteenth century, and while such a trade role may not be labor that necessarily resonates with contemporary feminism, it is still labor whose recovery is a feminist act. Similarly, we cannot safely characterize women in the print house as feminist exceptions, but if we want to recover a historically accurate account of women’s writing and labor, it is to these sites and practices to which we must return.</p>
<p>The  <em>WBHB</em>  is an example of digital enumerative bibliography as recuperation — to put the pieces together of a story that has far-reaching implications and powerful resonances. But it is also an attempt to collect sources beyond simple posterity. Feminist recovery requires a shift in the underpinnings of the academic industrial complex, and the data we have collected reveals a pattern of one step forward with two steps back, progress met with backlash. In what Mandell characterizes as    “Cycles of Forgetting”   <sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  , digital feminist recovery projects pop up and then quickly lay dormant; an array of teaching anthologies of women poets go out of print with no readily available alternatives; editorial apparatus to texts conspicuously focus on scandalous lives rather than on successful professional careers; close studies of women’s writing bypass bibliographic accuracy. Until this mindset shifts, women are in danger of being  “forgotten”  again, and Mandell argues that digital recovery is the best method of disrupting this process <sup id="fnref2:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Within this philosophy, the  <em>WBHB</em>  makes it harder to forget all the groundbreaking work that has been done on women who now fill anthologies, not just the historical subjects themselves. Even when this scholarship falls out of print, through responsible indexing it is not forgotten.</p>

A computer-assisted comparison using the newly developed DIAS/DENDRON ART (DDA) software of fifty-five oil paintings by Paul Cézanne, exhibited at the Galerie Vollard, Paris, in 1895, suggests that Cézanne’s <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> , is highly related to Veronese’s <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , in color, saturation, brightness, and complexity (Figures 2-4). Further computer-assisted analysis using DDA suggests that Cézanne drew from Veronese a “hidden” compositional structure to organize his Bather paintings

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h2 id="wölfflin-v2">Wölfflin V.2</h2>
<p>Art history as an academic discipline is relatively new <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  Formally established in 1834 at the University of Berlin with the appointment of Franz Kugler (1808-1858) as the first professor of art history, Kugler and his successors Jacob Burkhardt (1818-1897), and Heinrich Wölfflin (1864-1945) instituted methods for the formal analysis of art and specified many categories used today for classifying art <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  Wölfflin is noted for  “using parallel projectors in the delivery of art history lectures so that images could be compared.”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  If art history is relatively new as an academic course of study in the west, computer-assisted analysis of art is in its  “infancy,”  with Wölfflin, aided by slide projectors, as the first scholar to demonstrate the utility of technology in the field. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  As the editors of  <em>Digital Art History</em>  note in their 2015 inaugural issue, Wölfflin’s mode of comparison  “changed the method of art history for good:”    “His scientific achievements were a game changer in perceiving, analyzing, and presenting works of art in the scientific world and beyond”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To say that comparisons have produced the categories that structure art history as we know it today is not overstating the case. In  “Collections and/of Data: Art History and the Art Museum in the DH Mode,”  Matthew Battles and Michael Maizels stress the centrality of the comparative slide lecture in the discipline. They write:  “The slide lecture maintains a powerful grip on the collective art-historical imagination; it is the format through which art historical [sic] training begins, and it is by far the most popular means by which the discipline spreads its views and virtues to the mass of uninitiated undergraduates.”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  Lev Manovich, in the first issue of  <em>DAH</em>  concurs:  “to explore is to compare. And to compare, we first need to see”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. While computer-assisted text analysis has a robust history since the 1950’s, the  <em>Proceedings of Computer Vision and Image Analysis of Art</em>  in 2008, 2010 and 2011 are the only journals devoted to exploring computer-assisted methods for art analysis prior to  <em>DAH</em>  in 2015. In the 2008  <em>Proceedings</em> , editors David Stork and Jim Coddington propose that computers  “can reveal the fallibility in our perception and teach all of us to see with a more informed eye and mind”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  Computer-assisted methods of analysis can  “question the categories we already have, generate new ones, or create cultural maps that relate cultural artifacts in original ways”   <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Since 2008, computer scientists in collaboration with museum curators have applied computational methods to art for conservation, reconstruction, and restoration. X-ray imaging, infrared reflectography, UV-induced fluorescent imaging, and photo-induced luminescence photography can reveal the under-layers of paintings, identify the properties of pigments and binders, authenticate artworks, detect forgeries, and gauge optimal designs for museum and digital displays. Computer algorithms are used to measure and count brushstrokes, sort and classify artworks by style, identify the salient features of an artist’s style, and produce three-dimensional models that illustrate an artist’s working methods.</p>
<p>Even though digital tools make art available for viewing, pedagogy, and research like never before, <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  the use of data-enabled science, or algorithms, to interpret digitized art and compare painting styles continues to provoke skepticism among humanists. <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  As Stephen Ramsay observes in  “Humane Computing” :  “They fear an epistemology that does not merely value empirical data, but which (in its extreme philosophical forms) considers empirical data to be the only valid form of evidence”   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. We believe that the visualizations produced by computer applications do not replace direct experience of the artifact. Correlations do not necessarily indicate causality or an ultimate relationship in every instance. While a computer may place together certain artists with similar styles in a cluster, this does not always imply that there is a historical relationship between them, as their styles may have simply undergone convergent evolution. The computer’s lack of historical and artistic context means that the process always has a requirement of human interpretation.</p>
<p>We propose here computer-assisted techniques for comparing color, saturation, brightness and complexity between digitized paintings that updates Wölfflin’s method. No studies of digitized art to date use dendrography, a well-established method in computational biology since 1990. DIAS <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, an image analysis program, and DENDRON <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, a method for generating trees reflecting relatedness, are patented, tried-and-true software programs. Over 400 citations in peer-reviewed literature for the basic methods paper describing DENDRON support efficacy <sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Dendrography pre-dates the bourgeoning field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The efficacy of the very latest computer cognition systems based in machine learning is viewed at this time as inconclusive. As  <em>Science Daily</em>  (1/7/19) reports in  “Can artificial intelligence tell a teapot from a golf ball? Severe limitations of  deep learning  machines”  — even the latest programs cannot accurately identify shape when a pattern associated with another shape is grafted onto it. Machine learning systems  “are easily fooled.”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  Dendrography is a traditional computer-assisted method of comparing images and patterns. To that end, we believe that the computer applications DIAS and DENDRON, having been validated in many fields, may reliably  “extend the senses,”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  of the art historian. The visualizations they produce suggest similarities between paintings easily missed by human beings whose capacity to compare is limited by conceptual and subjective bias, lack of access to a work, or any number of reasons that make creating interesting comparisons challenging.</p>
<p>Dendrography has enormously productive applications for the comparison of formal and iconographic elements in paintings. Since formal analysis is often viewed as outdated in today’s art history, its potential as a subject for computational analysis has been overlooked (except for the few curatorial forays in this direction). As such, our approach not only attempts to see the value of the computational method, but also what DENDRON and DIAS may do to open up in surprising new ways what has been considered a finished part of the field. This may be the first study in digital art history that uses dendrography to cluster similar paintings and that employs computer programs to calculate golden rectangles in paintings for comparative purposes. The ever-growing raft of digitized paintings online, and the continual improvement of digital photography, calls for computer-assisted methods as long as these programs are reliable, the questions posed are appropriate for computer-assisted investigation, and the final interpretations are considered just that, namely interpretations.</p>
<p>Using the newly customized DIAS/DENDRON (DDA) programs (<a href="#appendix1">Appendix I</a>), we investigate in Part I a persistent connection between  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  by Veronese and Cézanne’s first female bather  <em>La Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> .  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  is enormous in scale, more than twenty-two feet by thirty-two feet in height and length, while the  <em>baigneuse</em>  is tiny, only eleven inches in height and five inches in width.  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> ’s subject matter is biblical, Christ transforming water into wine at the marriage feast, while Cézanne’s work is prosaic, a woman drying her hair after a bath. A traditional art historian, guided by genre expectations, might conclude that scale and theme obviate potential connections between the works, but using DDA, which normalizes scale, we can grasp surprising connections. Now, using DDA analysis, we can see how Cézanne capitalizes on Veronese’s color scheme in his first female  <em>baigneuse</em> . We may also use DDA to suggest new approaches to old problems. For example, Cézanne painted over eighty bathers in his lifetime, but these paintings continue to mystify scholars. To date, they are mostly interpreted in psychanalytic terms as representing Cézanne’s repressed sexuality and/or aggression.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  When we saw that Cézanne’s  <em>baigneuse</em>  might be intimately connected to  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , we then employed DDA to explore potential similarities in composition. In Part 2, using DDA analysis, we discovered that the composition of  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  is based on axial symmetry and the golden ratio (phi). When we apply DDA to identify axial symmetry and the golden ratio to  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  and the rest of Cézanne’s bathers, we find that Cézanne imitates the composition of  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  in virtually every bather painting. Based on axial symmetry and the golden section, then, we have formulated a computer-assisted approach to  “seeing”  Cézanne’s composition in his Bather series. Cézanne’s bathers, formerly perceived as  “awkward”  and composed with  “baffling imbalance,”  can now be viewed as  “golden”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. With DDA, we find that Cézanne is more likely guided by mathematics in designing his bather paintings, rather than by unconscious drives or motives.</p>
<p>This approach is an intervention in the newly established trend within the digital humanities of the  “micro-digital humanities.” <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  We are not, as Michael Greenhalgh imagines of digital art historians, throw[ing] data at the computer while hoping that somehow  “the computer will make sense of them”   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. We are not sifting  “the great unknown”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> for connections between texts or visual images, instead, we are comparing smaller curated datasets in order to measure influence between a master and student, a source and a re-imagining.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  In this case, we are comparing fifty-five curated digital facsimiles of Cézanne’s oil paintings exhibited in Ambroise Vollard’s 1895 Salon to Veronese’s  <em>Le Noces de Cana</em> , a source Cézanne  <em>identified as influential to him as an artist</em> .</p>
<p>Standing before  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , Cézanne is reported to have said regarding its color:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is what a painting should give us, a harmonious warmth, an abyss in which the eye can sink, a silent germination. A state of grace in colors…To love a painting, first you have to drink it in this way, in long drafts, lose consciousness; descend with the painter into the dark, complicated roots of objects come up again with colors, bloom with them in the sun. You have to know how to see, to feel, especially in front of a great machine such as the one Veronese built<br>
<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.  Art Historian Susan Sidlauskas describes Cézanne’s experience of the Veronese painting as like  “a mystic’s fusion with the deity”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Cézanne thought of Veronese’s colors as  “great noumenal entities, living ideas, creatures of pure reason…with whom we might correspond”   <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. By  “great machine,”  we take Cézanne to mean that Veronese’s work delivers to the aspiring painter figure studies, compositions, color combinations and more, structures that an artist can imitate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="quality-of-digital-reproductions">Quality of digital reproductions</h2>
<p>As Philip Ball observes in  <em>Bright Earth</em> ,  “all reproductions are approximations”   <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  And in regards to  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and Cézanne’s bathers, we must ask of any facsimile whether it is  “well or badly reproduced”   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. Digital reproductions must be as close to the original as possible. Bruno Latour and Adam Lowe discuss at length  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> ’s complex  “trajectory”  as an image. What Cézanne saw between 1861, his first trip to Paris, until his death in 1906 is not the  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  that we see now in the Louvre, as conservationist efforts have modified the painting. Currently  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  exists in its  “original”  (though repainted) version at the Louvre, and it exists in a fully  “restored”  version, based on digitization, housed in its  “original”  context, in a Benedictine refectory in Venice. The Louvre  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  is considerably darker than the Benedictine digital facsimile. The coat of the server depicted in the foreground of the Louvre  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  was originally red but was changed to green in 1989. Thus, no version today is exactly what Cézanne saw. For our purposes here, we use a digitized image of the pre-1989  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , with the tabard in his  “original”  red coat. This, perhaps begrimed with more dust, is the closest  “approximation”  to what Cézanne would have seen. However, we demonstrate that DDA grouped  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  in the same cluster with both renditions of  <em>Le Noces de Cana</em>  in dendrograms (<a href="#appendix2">Appendix II</a>).</p>
<p>Choosing Cézanne’s paintings for computer-assisted analysis is also complicated. Cézanne left many works unfinished, therefore, we selected for this study paintings exhibited during his lifetime. The paintings exhibited in the 1895 Vollard exhibition is an exemplary dataset for computation, as it was Cézanne’s first one-man show, with examples of paintings from every stage of his development. Most important, we can presume Ambroise Vollard, Cézanne’s friend and patron exhibited the works as  “finished”  with the artist’s support. For information about Cézanne’s paintings, and for digital facsimiles, we relied on John Rewald’s printed  <em>Catalogue Raisonné</em>  and Walter Feichenfeldt, Jayne Warman and David Nash’s  <em>The Paintings of Paul Cézanne: an Online Catalogue Raisonné</em>   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. <a href="#supplementaltable1">Supplemental Table I</a> lists all paintings used for this study and their digital and material provenance. All digital images are in the public domain for research and educational use. When there were multiple versions of digitized images on the web with different levels of brightness, saturation, and coloring, we consulted the online  <em>Catalogue Raisonné</em> , for the best match, or the websites of the museums that housed the work. In many cases, we checked digital facsimiles against original paintings on site in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Detroit, not only for accuracy in color, brightness, and saturation, but also for correct margin between figure and frame for our geometric partitioning.</p>
<h2 id="generating-dendrograms">Generating dendrograms</h2>
<p>The software program we have developed to compare digitized paintings is a composite of two patented programs DIAS (US patent #5,655,028 1997) and DENDRON (US patent #5,400,249 1995). The customized program DDA, allows the user to store and sort digitized images of pictures in a data file, measure parameters for comparison and then generate dendrograms, visual phylogenies of relatedness based on one or any combination of parameters. Both DIAS and DENDRON began development in the late 1980’s. DIAS was developed to analyze cell morphology, shape, cell movement and the dynamics of populations of cells, and has recently been used to study tumorigenesis in 2D and 3D. Dendron was developed to analyze and compare DNA fingerprints of infectious organisms and has been used to follow the progression of diseases in human populations. In  “The Ins and Outs of DNA Fingerprinting the Infectious Fungi,”  DENDRON is described in terms that we apply here for the comparison of paintings between the same or different painters. The combined programs, including the parameters we have measured and compared, and the generation of dendrograms, are described in Appendix I in more detail, with relevant references. In brief, images of a collection of pictures were scanned into a DDA data file. The DIAS portion of the program then automatically computed nine parameters, which included brightness, saturation, complexity, redness, orangeness, yellowness, greenness, blueness and purpleness. These parameters are described in Appendix I. To assess a similarity coefficient between two pictures for any one of these parameters or amongst any combination of these parameters, each parameter is assessed in a range of 0.00 to 1.00, 0.00 representing no relatedness and 0.01 to 1.00 representing progressively increasing values. The similarity coefficient (SAB) for one or any combination of parameters is then computed between all pairs of paintings in a collection, generating a matrix of SAB’s as demonstrated in Appendix I, Table A. Based on the matrix of SAB’s, a dendrogram (i.e., a phylogenetic tree of relatedness) is then generated by the unweighted pairgroup method based upon the arithmetic averages (UPGMA), originally used by Rohlf <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>, discussed in detail by Sneath and Sokal <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> and developed for DENDRON by Schmid et al. <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. The accuracy of the program was validated by Pujol et al <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>, with more than 410 citations in the literature reported by Google Scholar just for the methods paper  “The Ins and Outs of Fingerprinting for Infectious Fungi”   <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. In the generated dendrogram (e.g., in Figures 2 and 3), the nodes (i.e., vertical connections) approximate the hierarchy of similarity. An arbitrary threshold is drawn as a black vertical line through the dendrogram simply is a tool for visualizing the refutation of similarity or clades, related groups and clusters of paintings.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-relatedness-using-dendrography">Analysis of relatedness using dendrography</h2>
<p>Using DDA, we compared Cézanne’s fifty-five oil paintings presented at the Galerie Vollard in 1895 and Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> . The SAB’s for all DIAS parameters were used in generating the dendrogram in Figure 2. The dendrogram generated in this case could be separated into seven clades, a through f, using an SAB threshold of 0.83. Both Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> ,  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  and six additional Cézanne paintings were included in clade f (Figure 2). Interestingly, of the three paintings painted in the 1860s by Cézanne after first viewing  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , two of them,  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  (1869) and  <em>L’orgie de Nabuchodonosor</em>  (1967), resided in clade f, and were highly related. Since it was obvious that the one color assessed by DIAS in the unrestored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  that appeared disproportionally faded was  “green” , (and since the painting lacks the heavy green coat of the tabard as in post-1989 retouched versions), we generated a dendrogram in which the composite SAB was computed for all parameters but green (see table in the right lower corner of Figure 3). Using a high threshold, 14 clades were distinguished (Figure 3). One clade, b, clustered six pictures, which included  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  and  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  in a subclade with a node of 0.92 and a subcluster of four paintings, three of which ( <em>Les Begonias</em> ,  <em>La Baignade</em> ,  <em>Nature Morte</em> ) also resided in the clade b, containing  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> , using all parameters in Figure 2. Since a digital version of the restored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  is widely accessable on the web, we generated a dendrogram using the complete collection of parameters and obtained similar clustering of the restored facsimile of  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and Cézanne’s  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  (<a href="#appendix2">Appendix II</a>). Again, Cézanne’s  <em>L’Orgie de Nabuchodonosor</em>  clustered with Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and Cézanne’s  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> . The two Cézanne paintings were painted in 1867 and 1869, respectively, so both reflect early works potentially highly related to  <em>Le Noce de Cana</em> . We also analyzed the restored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  facsimile and the Cézanne collection using all parameters but green, and found that the restored facsimile was in a cluster containing Cézanne’s  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  and the other clustered paintings (<a href="#appendix2">Appendix II</a>). We generated a dendrogram of the Cézanne collection that included, both the unrestored and restored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> . The  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  and both unrestored and restored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  paintings clustered, and the cluster contained the same additional paintings in the clusters of the dendrograms generated with either the unrestored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  alone or the restored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  (<a href="#appendix2">Appendix II</a>, Figure A, B, C, D). In support of the similarity assessed by DDA in the collection in Figure 2, we generated a dendrogram that included Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , Cézanne’s  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> , and 19 paintings by other artists including Delacroix, Rubens and Tintoretto, all of which were shown in the Louvre between 1861 and 1906 (<a href="#appendix3">Appendix III</a>, Figure A). The  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  paintings grouped into a primary cluster, indicated by thick red lines, again indicating not only the similarity between Veronese’s  <em>Les Noce de Cana</em>  and Cézanne’s  <em>Baigneuse</em>  paintings, but also the accuracy of the DDA programs.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-hidden-patterns">Part 2. Hidden Patterns</h2>
<p>Just like Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , Paul Cézanne’s paintings continue to inspire wonder in his admirers. His contemporaries, Renoir and Matisse, spoke of his deployment of color and composition in godlike terms, while scholars today  “struggle to know”  his secret. Cézanne’s last words in 1904 to the young painter Emile Bernard heighten the sense of mystery and unknowability that surround the painter’s process. Richard Shiff’s 2004 Introduction to  <em>Conversations with Cézanne</em>  illustrates this mystery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He takes his secret to the grave,”  remarked Bernard to his wife, upon receiving word of Cézanne’s death:  “he wrote that he wanted to tell me everything, and I don’t know what he meant by that.”  Regretting his failure to visit Aix in 1906 as planned, Bernard knew that Cézanne, only a month before, had suggested that both men would better  “explain themselves”  whenever they finally met again in person. Even more poignantly, Bernard could recall the cryptic promise Cézanne included in a letter of the previous year:  “I owe you the truth in painting [en peinture], and I will tell it to you”<br>
<sup id="fnref2:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shiff concludes,  “Like Bernard-like Cézanne himself-we struggle to know”  (my italics). We propose Cézanne worked from a plan, and that his comments to Bernard indicate guardedness about sharing his process. As he advised the fellow painter Maurice Denis:  “You have to have a method. My father [said],  People have to play games.  That’s what I search for in painting&hellip;theories, sensations and theories&hellip;I wanted to copy nature but I never could do it”   <sup id="fnref3:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. In this second part of our analysis we identified parameters for DDA which we believed would allow us to begin to assess similarities based on composition. We tested whether  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  shared potential compositional similarities, and we sought parameters related to composition that could be quantified. Because of Cézanne’s frequent references to  “harmony”  in his conversations and letters, and his documented love for classical Greek and Roman culture, we turned to Classical conceptions of harmony, based on numbers and geometry, for parameters that we could quantify.</p>
<p>In this section, we compare only the relationship between axial lines and golden rectangles as determined by the picture’s frame in  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> . We decided to automate identification of the center and central axis of a painting, because of their technical importance to an artist, and because of their semantic weight. For Rudolf Arnheim, the dead center of a painting is not dead but  “alive with tension”   <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. The vertical and horizontal bisecting lines emanating from the center establish a  “solid spatial trellis in the brain.”  An artist must master the axis first, according to Arnheim, as it  “remains the base of reference that alone make obliqueness possible. Obliqueness is always perceived as a deviation [from the axis] hence its strongly dynamic character.”  Computer-assisted methods for identifying centers and axial lines are helpful as these can be mis-apprehended by a viewer. For example, upon first glance, many people see Christ as the center of  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , as opposed to the men carving meat on the balustrade above him. Once we used DDA to identify the center and the horizontal and vertical bisecting lines of  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , we chose to automate the identification of golden sections in a painting as determined by the square picture plane. In Appendix IV, we present the steps in the DDA program employed to automatically identify a number of geometric landmarks including what we have defined as the  “golden window,”  in a painting. This involves identifying the  “golden rectangle”  and the axial lines bisecting both vertically and horizontally the picture plane.</p>
<p>Many scholars have attempted to find hidden patterns in art works based on numbers. Most recently, Robert Bork’s studies of golden sections in medieval cathedral ground plans show that for centuries, artists and architects have used the mysterious divine proportion or golden ratio (1.618&hellip;) in their designs <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. For Arnheim, the golden ratio is satisfying  “because of its combination of unity and dynamic variety, whole and parts are nicely adjusted in strength so that the whole prevails without being threatened by a split, but at the same time, the parts retain some self-sufficiency”   <sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Veronese and Cézanne would have been familiar with Luca Pacioli’s handbook for artists,  <em>De Divina Proportione</em> , published in 1509. Seventy-one chapters are dedicated to demonstrating the golden section, a mathematical proportion based on an equation that produces phi or the never-ending value of 1.618&hellip; in artworks <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. Cézanne’s contemporary Symbolists, Odilon Redon and Paul Serusier, considered Platonic geometry, holy, or mystical, because it appeared in nature as repeated numbers and patterns. Cézanne and Veronese absorbed the concept of divine proportion in their training, and when they had the problem of creating a two-dimensional structure that expressed  “witnessing the holy,”  they found a rule or  “game”  in the golden section that suited their purposes. Using DDA, as a tool to section a painting geometrically, we show that the golden section may have a formal and thematic purpose for Veronese in  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>) and that Cézanne might have elaborated on this compositional structure in his Bather paintings.</p>
<p>While we could have discovered this hidden composition by applying a ruler and compass to reproductions from books, the advantage of DDA in studying composition is the mechanization of the geometer’s tools, and the quantity of digital reproductions we can quickly, and more precisely, rule than with human hands. It also allows for the quantification of parameters from the digitized image for further comparison using DDA software. DDA determines and saves golden ratio rectangles from any point on a painting, drawing up to nine symmetrical vertical or horizontal staves across a painting, and imposing and saving geometrical shapes on digital paintings. Since these parameters are associated with Neoplatonic ideals and classical harmony, we feel these might have bearing on Cézanne’s painterly concerns in his  <em>Bathers</em>  series.  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  achieves its uniqueness not only from a masterful deployment of color modelled on Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , but also from its invisible scaffolding, based on Platonic geometry. We believe that Cézanne hides this game in plain sight.</p>
<p>Cézanne left eighty  <em>Bather</em>  paintings in various states of completion after his death in 1906 at the age of 68. He repeats this, heretofore unidentified, compositional structure throughout his Bather series. Since Cézanne appears to have modeled his first female bather on  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , as our dendrograms imply, it is likely that Cézanne is linking  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  semantically. The subject of  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  is a wedding feast at Canaan where Christ performs the miracle of turning water into wine, a potent metaphor for the artist translating raw materials into representations. Christ transmutes water, something common, into something holy, strange, and magical; likewise, Cézanne divinizes his bathers; he makes them noumenal, by way of his predecessor Veronese — through color harmonies and divine geometry.</p>
<p>Cézanne viewed geometry as a divine architecture, and he understood the center of a bounded four-sided square to be its axial eye. The center of a painting represents the  “truth”  or the  “eye of god”   <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. In its aggressively axial construction <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>, Veronese appears to take account of the square frame, its center, the golden rectangle, and the golden window in organizing his composition for thematic effect (<a href="#appendix4">Appendix IV</a>). The sacrificial meat above Christ’s head is at the exact center of  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> . Like a blade, the vertical and horizontal axes divide the meat. The axis signifies that the focus of the painting is sacrifice, and its cognates, Christ, directly below the sacrificial meat, and the dog at the bottom of the painting. The vertical axis bisecting the painting runs directly through Christ’s right eye and the left eye of the dog. As a dog signifies loyalty in medieval/renaissance Christian iconography, the implied vertical line uniting sacrifice/Christ’s eye/loyalty appears to emphasize Veronese’s aim of producing a sensually enlightening painting. To make the painting’s purpose legible, he provides a strong horizontal balcony across the middle of the painting above Christ’s head. The top of the balcony passes through the exact center of the painting.</p>

<p>In  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>   <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>, just as axial intersection emphasizes theme, so too does the golden section. The golden section intersects Christ’s eyes, and the eyes or mouths of the witnesses flanking Christ. The  “golden window”  we have identified frames a quarter of Christ’s face, partial faces of three witnesses to his left (specifically through the mouth and eyes). Then, above and behind them, three convex columns supporting the balustrade where butchers are preparing sacrificial meat. Technically, the benefit of a  “golden window”  for Veronese is that it allows him to represent depth by mediating the distance between flat wall and blue sky with a band of recessing modulations. In the golden window of Figure 4, we glimpse the tablecloth behind the columns of the balustrade above Christ’s head, as well as the robes of the butcher, and a building in the distance. In Figure 4, the golden window underscores theme and creates a sense of depth or of  “descended”  figures within the composition of the painting. As Christ has  “descended”  from his godlike nature to be among humans, the golden ratio becomes the line along which Veronese arranges Christ and his witnesses at the feast. In Figure 5, we see the lowering effect afforded by the golden window. Through the golden window, we see Cézanne’s central bather (whose right knee and shoulder are aligned with the vertical axis of the picture frame), descending into a pool of water. We can now say that, in addition to discovering surprising connections in color, saturation, complexity and brightness in paintings, there are landmarks in paintings that DDA automatically computes. These are the center of the painting, the horizontal and vertical bisecting lines (axis), the golden rectangle, the golden strips (the space between the vertical and horizontal bisecting lines and the golden sections of the upper right and lower left sides of the picture plane), and the golden window (located at the right base of the golden rectangle).</p>

<p>Like Leonardo da Vinci, Cézanne thought paintings were superior to poems because they inspired reverence in viewers <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. As he expressed to Leo Larguier,  “Art is a religion. Its goal is the elevation of thought”   <sup id="fnref4:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. He wanted to create in paintings a  “harmony parallel to nature,”  a noumenon, in that the painting would be a thing in itself (with a life of its own) whose purpose was to  “enlighten”   <sup id="fnref5:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Cézanne stated his commitment to the  “law of harmony,”  numerical patterns he saw in nature, throughout his letters and conversations. He stated:  “To read nature is to see it beneath the veil of interpretation as colored patches succeeding one another according to a law of harmony. The major hues are thus analyzed through modulations” ” <sup id="fnref6:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>By harmony, Cézanne means harmonia in a Platonic sense of  “fitting together:”  not only the ideal forms and proportional arrangements of forms based on number found in nature, but also as  “the reconciliation of opposites by a third element, bringing them all into a new unity”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Cézanne synthesized contrasts: he  “modulated”  color as a way of building form. He saw the task of reconciling opposites as a magician’s task. He stated:  “Painting is not beautiful if the surface plane remains flat. Objects must turn, grow distant, live. That is the magic of our art”   <sup id="fnref7:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. To restate, in the golden section, Cézanne finds a way to represent infinity in his paintings, which for him, like the Symbolists, was the essence of nature. In the synthesis of opposites, whether in color contrasts, spatial  “near and far,”  or  “up and down,”  Cézanne creates a  “harmonious”  painting.</p>
<h2 id="cézanne-and-ingres">Cézanne and Ingres</h2>
<p>Certainly,  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  is not the sole model for  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> . Relevant to our purposes here, a study of Cézanne’s Bathers, as a series, from their origin and into their development, Cézanne’s ambivalence toward French Neo-Classicism, and its arch-representative Dominique Ingres is well-documented. Cézanne would have seen  <em>La Source</em>  at the Louvre (<a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>).<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>    <em>La Source</em> , begun by Ingres in 1820, and completed in 1856, when Ingres was 76-years-old, was infamous to impressionist painters as its graceful lines and classicism represented the highest standard in Fine Art at the time. Cézanne did not care for the painting. He called it  “system and false spirit”   <sup id="fnref8:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Applying axial lines and golden windows to  <em>La Source</em>  and  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> , we can now see Cézanne copying and departing from his model in surprising ways.</p>

<p>As Michael Baxandall observes,  “influence”  works in reverse <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Ingres’  <em>La Source</em>  did not  “influence”  Cézanne. Instead, Cézanne drew a pattern from Veronese and subjected another model, Ingres’  <em>La Source</em>  to the pattern, then dilated upon the results to suit his aims, the  “harmonizing”  of the youthful nude body. First, we notice that model and copy are mirror images. With arms raised, they form S shaped figures in classical contrapposto. They are symmetrical only in that, when a golden rectangle is formed over the rectangular plane of the canvasses, both figures’ left breasts are framed by the middle vertical line and the golden ratio vertical lines formed by the golden rectangle. The middle vertical axis also runs through both figures’ left eyes. The golden window in Ingres’ work frames the girl’s left thigh. In Cézanne, the golden window alludes to the girl’s thigh and hip by partially representing (yet with more convexity) her right hip through tonal modulation. Pointedly, Cézanne uses the subordinate horizontal line of the picture plane’s golden rectangle to  “lower”  his figure. In  <em>La Source</em>  the axial eye (picture center) is the sex of the young girl emptying the urn of water. The golden section runs across her legs above her knees. Clearly, in  <em>La Source</em> , the picture center, as the  “eye”  of  “god,”  is Ingres’ visual pun on the source, water, and female genitalia. In Cézanne’s work, the exact center is the nude female’s hip swiveled in classical contrapposto, perhaps indicating that his  “source”  is  “classical art,”  while her sex is aligned with the golden section, making it  “golden.”  In  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> , by aligning the female sex with the golden section, within a theme that involves washing the body, and in the case of  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> , a woman drying her hair, Cézanne is harmonizing the studio erotism of Ingres’ young nude — he is bringing  “the source”  back to nature.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  He also  “classicizes”  the nude human form by posing his bathers in natural settings, and by associating them with the idealized friendships and homo-social eroticism of the Classical world. In his earliest male bathers as well, Cézanne aligns sex with the golden section of the left side of the frame (<a href="#figure07">Figure</a> 7).</p>

<p>In Figure 7, as in female nudes, Cézanne encloses the left breast of an early male bather (7.L.) in the golden rectangle and the vertical bisecting line of the painting. In the middle painting (7.M.) he centers or aligns the left male breast between the golden rectangle and the vertical bisecting line of the painting. In the right painting (7.R), the bather’s left breast aligns with the vertical bisecting line, while the bather’s left elbow aligns with the golden rectangle. In all three works, the golden window captures thigh and background. The navel aligns with the horizontal bisecting line and sex aligns with phi (the bottom side of the golden rectangle determined by the dimensions of the painting).</p>

<h2 id="the-golden-strips">The Golden Strips</h2>
<p>Adjacent to the golden window (<a href="#appendix4">Appendix IV</a>) are the  “golden strips”  which elaborate on the point emphasized by the window. The  “golden strip”  in a bather painting is between the axial and golden ratio horizontal lines or vertical lines of the picture plane (<a href="#appendix4">Appendix IV</a>). The golden strips allow for an alternation of frontal and rear nude forms with their sexes aligned with the golden section. As with Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , Cézanne aligns the heads of the descended figures beneath the middle horizontal line bisecting the picture. For Andre Lohte, Cézanne’s genius is in his alternation of foreground and background figures. (What we call Cézanne’s  “game,”  he calls Cézanne’s  “ruse” ). Lohte stated of Cézanne:  “Genius consists in knowing how to compensate, through constant repetition of each phenomenon, for every thrust into depth, by an equal advance or return. Without this ruse the eye would immediately find the horizon, the distance, without being excited by the successive oppositions which retard its quest for space, and procure for it a subtle pleasure”   <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. We can now consider Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  a masterful example of this phenomenon in fine art painting, a strategy in painting with an endless  “trajectory.” <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  In Figure 9, we present the horizontal golden strip of  <em>Quatre Baigneuses</em>  (1888-1890) which shows Cézanne’s  “alternation of foreground and background”  described by Andre Lohte. In Figure 9, and in other Bathers, Cézanne’s  “successive oppositions”  have semantic meaning. For us, this signals Cézanne’s reconciliation of opposites in his windows and strips. Thematically, Cézanne reconciles body and mind into a third  “noumenal”  alliance. He aligns the attentive and communicative heads, hearts, and sexes of his descended and/or risen figures, along the golden section and the axial center of his Bather paintings. In <a href="#supplementaltable3">Supplemental Table 3</a>, we present the horizontal  “golden strips”  of the 64 bathers in this study.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-church">Beyond the Church</h2>
<p>Cézanne presents an affirmative and benedictory vision of youth and beauty in his Bathers. In  <em>Les Grandes Baigneuses</em> , a 1906 painting left incomplete when he died, the church in the distance shows that his bathers exist in an intermediate space between the viewer outside the picture plane and the church (<a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>). The bathers are in a space of their own, determined by the geometry that unites them. When we apply the geometric analysis of DDA to the painting, we see that the golden window frames a reality beyond the church. We feel this illustrates Cézanne’s Neoplatonic leanings, and fuels his concept of art as a religion. In his serial use of golden sections to structure his bather series, we see an interest in the infinite, and an understanding of the golden window as affording a glimpse of it.</p>

<h2 id="homage-to-the-classical-world">Homage to the Classical World</h2>
<p>Cézanne also uses sacred geometry to structure the imagined space of the image. In  <em>Baigneurs en Plein Air</em>  (<a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>), an unfinished painting from 1890-1891, the ground of the five figures forms a Pentagon, below the horizontal line that bisects the painting.</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As stated in Appendix IV, DDA will discriminate a variety of geometric shapes within a picture. The figure emerging in the golden window represents it triangular point. This implied pentagonal shape illustrates Cézanne’s advice to artists throughout his letters and conversations:  “Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, a plane, recedes toward a central point” ” <sup id="fnref9:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. In addition to an implied pentagon, these bathers form an imaginary cone, a large triangle parallel to the surface plane whose tip coincides with the middle vertical axis of the paintings. This triangle provides vertical armature for the five bodies, linking them together in one unit with the armpits aligned at the diagonal lines. This compositional triangle both dynamically lifts the figures, and stabilizes the composition.</p>
<p>Cézanne suggests with a few blue and red strokes the figure whose breast is framed in the golden window of Figure 11. Cézanne repeated this particular composition in his search for a realization commensurate with his ideal. We can now think of a man lowering himself into a body of water as a compositional  “problem”  Cézanne was trying to solve in his Bather series. Painted in four-sided constructive strokes, and in Veronesian,  “noumenal”  blue and red color patches that resemble a harlequin’s costume, the figure is in motion, and not fully formed. He is an intermediate being, not yet concretized, nor fully translated between here and there within the noumenal square of the painting. Cézanne is clearly attuned to magical conceptions of the number four as representing the fourth element of earth in Platonic doctrine and inherent in the squares of the harlequin’s costume. He was also aware of the five-sided figure of the pentagon as representing the regenerative aspects of creation. The Harlequin’s checkerboard costume has been described as symbolizing  “a chthonic force”   <sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. If so, this chthonic force’s heart is framed in the golden window, a highly significant spot, charged with meaning, as we now see in Cézanne’s Bathers, and particularly in this painting (Figure 11) depicting five men in geometrical relationship to each other. In addition to a sacred understanding of numbers and shapes, three (triangle: divinity), four (square: earth) and five (pentagon: creation and regeneration), a means to create a harmony  “parallel”  to nature, this painting’s composition is Cézanne’s special homage to the pastoral poetry of Theocritus and Virgil, the classical literature he loved. It is well- known that Cézanne translated Theocritus and Virgil as a pastime in his youth <sup id="fnref10:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. The left side of Figure 11 appears to represent the sympotic aspects of male fraternity with the seated figure under the pine tree discoursing with the standing figure seen from behind. The right side of the painting pays homage to the erotic aspects of homo-sociality implied by Theocritus and developed in the bucolic poems of Virgil. In the poems, herdsmen gather to sing songs about  “Daphnis,”  a young man who drowns himself out of erotic frustration, or his cognates in the classical tradition who die: Hylas, Delphis, Adonis, and Narcissus, other beautiful boys, like the one in Figure 11  “posing”  in the foreground. Theocritus and Virgil’s lost boys are the poets’ reflections on their own lost youth and/or the loss of specific male friends, or lovers <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. For Cézanne,  “Nature is not on the surface; it is in depth,”  hence, the man in the water (in the depths) crying on the far right <sup id="fnref11:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Cézanne’s effort to divinize the nude human body in company with other divinized bodies, whether  “co-ed”  or segregated by sex, and in the many paintings where difference in sex is not explicit, we see the artist’s engagement with Neoplatonism, in that his goal is to create a harmoniously simplified world with a playful, affirmative, benedictory vision of youthful nudity.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this paper, using the automated tools afforded by DDA, we have forged a connection in color, composition, geometry, and theme between  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> , and from this connection, we have brought to light unifying characteristics in Cézanne’s Bathers heretofore unidentified. We have identified the connection between  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  and  <em>Baigneuse debout s’essuyant le cheveux</em>  by producing dendrograms of Cézanne’s fifty- five 1895 Galerie Vollard Exhibition oil paintings compared to Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , a painting we know Cézanne admired at the Louvre during his formative years as a painter and throughout his life. Using computer-assisted methods we generated dendrograms that clustered paintings related in color, saturation, brightness and complexity. After studying these parameters, we applied the geometric program of DDA to the study of Cézanne’s composition. Because Cézanne expressed Neoplatonic ideals regarding paintings in his conversations and letters, we programmed DDA to compute axial lines and golden rectangles according to the dimensions of the square, rectangle, and other geometric parameters to the painting under scrutiny. Using DDA we identified the golden rectangle for  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> ,  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  and Ingres’  <em>La Source</em>  (another likely model for  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em> ). From the similarities and differences between the three paintings identified, based on axial symmetry and the golden section, we have formulated an approach to  “seeing”  Cézanne’s composition in his Bather series. Cézanne’s noumenal bodies, formerly perceived as  “awkward”  and composed with  “baffling imbalance,”  can now be viewed as  “golden”   <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. These are only the first parameters, customized to the study of paintings that we have introduced to DDA. As we continue to expand and use this computer program to compare influence between painters, we will add new parameters such as measurements for convexity, concavity, texture and composition, based on edge detection technology in the original DIAS program. These tools will assist us in investigating a variety of questions basic to art history.</p>

Biol.</em>  229-250), and the dendrography software program DENDRON. Schmid, Jan, Edward Voss and David R. Soll.  “Computer-Assisted Methods for Assessing Strain Relatedness in Candida albicans by Fingerprinting with the Moderately Repetitive Sequence Ca3.”    <em>Journal of Clinical Microbiology.</em>  Vol 28.6 (June 1990). 1236-1243. Soll, D. R.  “The ins and outs of DNA fingerprinting the infectious Fungi.”    <em>Clinical Microbiology Reviews</em> . Vol.13.2 April 2000. P.332-370. The programs originally written in C++ have been converted to JAVA (Graphics Programming With Java, Second Edition. 2001. Steven’s Scott/Jones, Inc.). Images of paintings are scanned into a DDA folder, with borders equal to the inner edges of the frame and normalized for size. If a painting is faded, hue will not be significantly affected since DDA employs HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) color space (Oracle Java 7 documentation, online for  “Class Color” ), as opposed to RGB (red, green, blue). DDA then automatically computes nine parameters that include brightness, saturation, complexity, redness, orangeness, yellowness, greenness, blueness and purpleness. Additional parameters based on DIAS edge detection programs are now under development and will be incrementally added. The  “brightness”  parameter is computed by converting the pixels of the entire image to HSB. A value of 0% is black and 100% is white. The average % for the entire picture is computed and the value converted to a range of 0.00 to 1.00. The  “saturation”  parameter is treated in a similar fashion. It represents the average richness of all colors assessed, is computed from 0 to 100%, then normalized to a value in the range of 0.00 to 1.00. For the  “complexity”  parameter, the image is first converted to grays with pixel intensities ranging from 0 to 255. The average value is then normalized to 0.00 to 1.00. The final parameters are six hues. On the color or  “hue”  wheel, they vary from 0 to 360°. The number of pixels with redness at 0° ± 5°, orange at 20 ± 5°, yellowness at 60 ± 5°, greenness at 120 ± 5°, blueness at 240 ± 5° and purpleness at 270 ± 5°, are computed and divided by the total number of pixels in the image. These individual pixel proportions are then converted to 0.00 to 1.00. The values of each parameter, all converted to a range of 0.00 to 1.00, were then used to generate a similarity coefficient (SAB) between every pair of paintings in a collection, using the following formula:<br>

<p>where ai and bi are the values of a parameter I for paintings A and B respectively, and k is the number of parameters. This formula was derived from that developed by Schmid, J., Voss, E. and Soll, D.R. 1990. (J. Clin Microbiol. 28, 1236-1243) for banding patterns of DNA fingerprints in which each band is a restrictive fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern representing a parameter (Soll et. al. 1997 US Patent #5, 655, 028). An SAB of 0.00 represents complete dissimilarity, an SAB of 1.00 identicalness, and SABs of 0.01 to 0.99, increasing levels of similarity. For this study the average of the parameters of paintings are used to generate the SABs between all paintings in a collection, which are logged into a matrix, as presented for 18 pictures in Appendix I Table 1.</p>

<p>The matrix is then used to generate a dendrogram using the unweighted pair group method based on arithmetic averages (UPGMA), first employed by Rohlf ,1963 Classification of  <em>Aedes</em>  by numerical taxonomic methods [Diptera, Culcidae]. (Ann. Entomal. Soc. Am. 56, 798-804) and discussed in more detail for application by Snesth and Sokel (1973. Numerical Taxonomy W.H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA). In generating a dendrogram, connections are identified in descending values. The matrix is first scanned for the SAB with the highest value. The first two are joined by a vertical node at that SAB. If two or more pairs have the same highest SAB, one is picked randomly to initiate the process of generating a tree. The system then grows the tree of relatedness, connecting pairs, individual paintings and groups of two or more, or groups. The node involving more than two paintings is computed as the arithmetic mean of the SABs between the pictures connected. This process continues until all pictures are connected to form a relatedness tree (dendrogram). The accuracy of the dendrogram has been assessed by goodness of fit (i.e., whether the distance in the dendrogram approximates the SABs in the matrix (Avis, J.C. 1994. Molecular numbers, natural history and evolution. Chapraon and Hull, New York, NY). By using completely different methods to assess genetic relatedness between the same collection of strains of an infectious fungus, the accuracy of the DENDRON program was previously verified (Pujol, C., joly, S., Lockhart, S.R., Sebastian, N., Tibayrenc, M., and Soll, D.R. 1977. J. Clin Microbiol, 2348-2358; Soll D.R. 2000. Clin Microbiol Rev 13, 332-370). The robustness of DIAS/DENDRON ART (DDA) in clustering was also verified by the addition of the restored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  to the Cézanne collection and the unrestored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , as described in Appendix II.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-ii">Appendix II</h2>
<p>A comparison of the Cézanne Galerie Vollard collection with the unrestored (Appendix II A) and restored (Appendix II B) versions of Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , using all parameters but green. Greenness was removed because in the restored version, a man’s cloak, which was red, was converted by restoration to green. Both Cézanne’s  <em>Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux</em>  and Veronese’s  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em>  reside in the same cluster with the restored and unrestored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> . It should be noted that the alternative clusters in the three dendrograms share a majority of other related Cézanne pictures, as is evident in lists of the paintings in the alternative clusters, presented in Appendix II D. These results also demonstrate the accuracy of the clustering method of DIAS/Dendron, given that the addition of different versions, in this case the unrestored and restored  <em>Les Noces de Cana</em> , or the addition of both, does not disrupt relationships, even though each dendrogram is generated independently, using the unweighted pair-group method employing arithmetic averages, as described in Appendix I.</p>

<p>In  <em>A New History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present</em>  (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), Rens Bod maps art history’s trajectory in the western world. For Bod, the formal study of art history begins with Vitruvius’s theory of harmonious proportion in  <em>On Architecture</em>  (15 BCE) and continues with Pliny’s discussions of illusionism in  <em>Natural History</em>  (77 CE). Though China had a thriving field of art historical scholarship in the Middle Ages, the western world produced few written discussions of art between Pliny and Alberti’s works. Bod cites Alberti’s  <em>On Painting</em>  (1435) as the first theoretical treatise on art, followed by Piero della Francesca’s  “On the Perspective for Painting”  (1435), A Treatise on Painting, attributed to Leonardo da Vinci and compiled by Francesco Melzi (1540), then Vasari’s  <em>Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects</em>  (1550). Bod views the advent of the digital humanities as a natural extension of the general search for principles and patterns that directs humanistic inquiry. 311-325.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Kugler divided art history into pre-Greek, classical, romantic and modern periods. Burkhardt identified the features of Renaissance art. Wölfflin distinguished Baroque from Renaissance art through the relations of differences principle employed in structural linguistics. In analytically comparing paintings, Wölfflin showed that Renaissance art is linear, flat, and closed, while Baroque art is painterly, deep, and open.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>“It should be difficult today to conceive of the computer as any more than a speedy idiot obeying a set of precise instructions; but many in the humanities do indeed continue to regard it as a black and magical (or black-magical) box — throw the data at it, and somehow the computer will make sense of them.”  Michael Greenhalgh,  <em>A Companion to Digital Humanities</em> . <a href="#http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/">http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/</a>. Stephen Ramsay in  <em>Humane Computation,</em>  summarizes objections to DH:  “There are many who think scatter plots filled with data points drawn from, say, English novels, are already a crime against the humanities — the death of all that is good and pure about humanistic study. For them, the problem is positivism in its properly technical sense. They fear an epistemology that does not merely value empirical data, but which (in its extreme philosophical forms) considers empirical data to be the only valid form of evidence. They imagine a computationally driven history or French literature curriculum that forsakes the ancient circle of the seminar for the modern angles of the server room. They imagine humanistic conversation debasing itself in the form of technical cavils, humanistic ethics becoming nothing more than  practical business ethics,  and teaching degenerating into mere training.”&#160;<a href="#fnref:12" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>In  “Distant Reading and Intellectual History” , Ted Underwood writes that distant reading  “doesn’t overemphasize technology, and it candidly admits that new methods are mainly useful at larger scales of analysis.”  Our work here scales down a distant reading approach. 138 paintings is still more than the brain can handle in making comparisons, nevertheless, the data set is small enough to allow the researcher to toggle between the images and graphical output to verify hypotheses and make discoveries.&#160;<a href="#fnref:23" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Can digital images replace physical paintings as serious objects for study? Certainly, there are irreducible elements to paintings that do not translate well electronically or in print, and that demand first-person viewing, such as the luminous and changing effects of varnishes and glazes on paintings, and the layering and aging of paints. Whether in print or online, all reproductions of paintings are  “approximations” . In even the most expensively illustrated books, the same paintings may vary in color. Phillip Ball discusses the limitations of print and the digital reproductions of works of art in  <em>Bright Earth</em> . He observes how  “for a coloristically complex picture like Danae, no two reproductions will look the same.”  Nevertheless,  “All written discourses of art must rely on reproductions to make their point.”  Art Historians depend on approximations for their work, and computer-assisted systems, though they convert these approximations into numbers, can provide us with data that is inaccessible subjectively, data that the researcher must interpret.&#160;<a href="#fnref:27" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The theme for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180210082132/https://dhweek.nycdh.org/">NYCDHWeek</a> 2018 was  <em>DH in the Moment: Reaction, Response, Relevance,</em>  which the organizers note was designed to  “consider the ways in which DH work can be extremely timely, political, and radical.” <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  Projects that spring immediately to mind as prime examples of such work might be the #PRMapathon initiative that began at Columbia University following the devastation of Hurricane Maria in late 2017, or the more recent, multi-layered #TornApart/#Separados data mapping in response to  “the USA’s 2018  Zero Tolerance Policy  for asylum seekers at the US Ports of Entry and the humanitarian crisis that has followed”   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. As Lindsay McKenzie pronounces, such  “rapidly produced and highly topical digital humanities projects are challenging perceptions of the field”   <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and are therefore drawing our attention to what the digital humanities can do  “in the moment.”</p>
<p>There is much to be said for these projects, much that has already been said and more than I am capable of saying here on the technical, the practical, and the affective labors involved; but that won’t be my attempt in this essay. I focus, instead, on the fact of the current questioning of how the digital humanities can be  “timely, political, and radical.”  The timing of this question interests me because it was not a prevalent question even a decade ago. Judging from the focus of a majority of DH publications, which increased significantly approximately a decade ago, the prevalent question for many years was: What is the digital humanities?</p>
<p>We certainly haven’t answered that question to everyone’s — or maybe even anyone’s — satisfaction, but I find it more interesting that we are, in this moment, asking not just what the digital humanities does, but what the digital humanities does for others. For instance, in a recent article in  <em>Inside Higher Ed</em>  Will Fenton writes:  “It’s time that digital humanists own their role as public humanists…. Framing digital work as public work raises important questions, not just about what we do, but where and for whom we do it”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. These questions mark a turn in the digital humanities, a turn that signifies an acceptance of space in the academy and ownership of a recognized (potential) public platform that now demands we do something with it.</p>
<p>In turning to this question of how we do what we may do for others in the digital humanities, I speak from a rootedness in Caribbean studies and I begin with a Caribbean-centered digital project from 10 years ago, a time when digital humanists (newly named as such) were realizing the institutionalization of the Digital Humanities. In 2007, commissioned by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, Ghanaian-Jamaican poet Kwame Dawes began research for a project on HIV/AIDS in Jamaica. Dawes’ research resulted in traditional methods of reportage: a standard, albeit extended, essay for  <em>The Virginia Quarterly</em>  and two short documentaries for public television. Additionally, Dawes was inspired to create a collection of poetry from the experience and to perform the poems to music. Still unsatisfied with these results, Dawes further collaborated with the Pulitzer Center to create <a href="http://www.livehopelove.com/">Live Hope Love</a>, an interactive web project that combined much of the above materials, with additional video interviews, music and photography.</p>
<p>Before I delve into more details about the project, I want to say that I was hesitant to begin here because:<br>
<em>Live Hope Love</em>  was, to all appearances, a well-funded project, which is rare in cases of what may be defined as activist digital work, and  It falls uneasily in that gray area between traditionally defined digital humanities work and new media.</p>
<p>But, in keeping with Roopika Risam’s contention that given the many  “earlier, oft­unrecognized instances of digital humanities work that [engage] with difference,”  I agree that there are  “alternate histories we must write about the digital humanities”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. I want to write Dawes into this DH genealogy and therefore begin with the messy multimedia-ness of  <em>Live Hope Love</em> . It is partially the project’s straddling of this unclear division between media formats that makes it ideal as a paradigm of the ways that digital platforms are able to react, respond, and be relevant  “in the moment.” <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The digital is what enables the seamless hybridity of the  <em>Live Hope Love</em>  project, as well as the ethical navigation of the very real power differentials at play in a US-based report on HIV/AIDS in Jamaica. The  “vital voices”  of those  “living with HIV/AIDS”  — whether they have the virus themselves or are caregivers to those who do — are centered in the navigation of the site. In terms of technology, the poetry, documentary footage, video interviews, and performances are able to coexist coherently — the real alongside the poetic, critical alongside creative — within the design of the platform. The project itself is static, a closed aesthetic product, but it links back to the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, where the continuous life of the project is captured via articles and videos related to Dawes’ Jamaica research and links also to a similar project Dawes later conducts in Haiti.</p>
<p>The web-based production of  <em>Live Hope Love</em>  allows for the results of Dawes’ research in the HIV/AIDS community in Jamaica to be relatively easily available to the members of that community, for them to consume or use as desired or needed. It also allows for the stories of and from members of this community to be relatively accessible to those of us  <em>outside</em>  said community, both within and without Jamaican borders. Stories filtered, yes, in part by Dawes and his collaborators — the photographer and the musicians — but also the community members’ stories in their own voices.</p>
<p>The ethics of this presentation of Jamaicans living with HIV/AIDS is what makes the digital nature of this project so important. Though the entirety of the site does frame the video interviews, they can be played in any order and without the hierarchizing format of the documentary (for those who do want this fixed format, the two documentaries produced from Dawes’ trips to Jamaica are also included on the site).  <em>Live Love Hope</em>  demonstrates how a digital platform can be designed to ethically respond to the needs of vulnerable and marginalized Caribbean communities while representing them from elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is one face of DH Activism. It is not a workshoppable, immediately-produced, immediately-reproducible, lightning-fast-results form of activism, but it is nevertheless one attempt at redressing a social inequality and generating positive social change. And this is what I take this question of response and relevance to be about: redress of social inequalities and the making of positive social change. But this is not new to the digital humanities. At least, the question may be new, in this DH moment, but the practice is not. In particular, those of us in Caribbean studies, in black studies, in women’s studies, who intersect with the digital humanities, have always already been invested in making our digital work relevant and responsive to the communities we work within.</p>
<p>To speak about those intersections, I’d like to go back to that DH moment of institutionalization when many scholars were offering definitions of what DH is, was, could and should be. At the end of his much cited essay,  “What Is Digital Humanities and What’s It Doing in English Departments?,”  Matthew Kirschenbaum writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever else it might be, then, the digital humanities today is about a scholarship (and a pedagogy) that is publicly visible in ways to which we are generally unaccustomed, a scholarship and pedagogy that are bound up with infrastructure in ways that are deeper and more explicit than we are generally accustomed to, a scholarship and pedagogy that are collaborative and depend on networks of people and that live an active, 24-7 life online. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><br>
This, of course, is not the definitive answer to Kirshchenbaum’s titular question(s) but it aims to be as capacious as possible for that moment. There is, however, a notable absence of activism in this definition, indicative of the perspective of the field then. Kirschenbaum writes at a particular time in the institutionalization of the digital humanities, one during which it was becoming the  “next big thing”  and required much discussion of definition and borders, which activism necessarily blurs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the manner of the digital culture it is intimately engaged with, Digital Humanities itself undergoes change rapidly, so that now, only 8 years after that  “moment of definition,”  we are once again asking questions of who we are and what it is we do. Specifically, how does DH work  “in the moment”  and why have our embraced definitions been noticeably devoid of an integrated activist component. But to ask such questions is to exclude, to return to Risam’s phrasing, the many  “earlier, oft­unrecognized instances of digital humanities work that [engage] with difference.”  The  “we”  on the margins of those definitions of the Digital Humanities have been steadily hacking and yacking with our communities and with our communities’ interests at the heart of our digital activities.</p>
<p>In essence, it is not a coincidence that this question of how digital humanities work can be  “timely, political, and radical”  arises in tandem with an increased recognition of diversity in DH. Movements like #TransformDH, #dhpoco, FemTechNet, HASTAC, GO::DH, etc <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  — many of which think (or thought) activism alongside research and pedagogy — focus on members from marginalized communities who have used digital tools to further their voices and existence. The two (activism and  “diversity” ) are inextricable. The  “relevance”  of DH, therefore, is not a new question for those who have relied on it as part of their activism, and who have incorporated their activism in their DH work. Black studies, gender studies, Caribbean studies are founded on the question of how academic research connects to the communities under study (at least when it is done well). In recognizing the contributions of these methodologies to DH (and vice versa), digital humanities is being forced to also recognize ways a definition based on scholarship and pedagogy reveals only part of the whole picture.</p>
<h2 id="heading-1"></h2>
<p>In using the term  “activism”  in conjunction with the digital humanities, I am thinking more broadly perhaps than the standard definition of political activism. Rather, I am thinking along the lines of how Amy Earhart implicitly defines it in,  “Can Information Be Unfettered? Race and the New Digital Humanities Canon.”  Earhart speaks of leveraging  “materials and knowledge … to change the social position of people of color” ; in particular for the digital humanities, to use the  “space of the Internet [to] allow those who [have] been silenced to have a voice”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. In this way, DH activism can form a necessary bridge between the lingering theory and practice divide of digital humanities. Asking not so much what it is you are doing, but rather, how does what you are doing serve to generate positive social change?</p>
<p>To make concrete the range of how digital work within black studies largely, and Caribbean studies particularly, is already built on these questions of relevance to the community or communities at the center of the work, I offer below two very different examples of digital work committed to social change. First, Ruddy Roye, a Brooklyn-based photographer raised in Jamaica who as early as 2013, styled himself as an  “Instagram activist” ; and second, the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/esss/">Slave Societies Digital Archive</a>, which since 2003 has  “digitally preserve[d] endangered ecclesiastical and secular documents related to Africans and Afro-descended peoples in the Americas”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Ruddy Roye, already a photographer by trade for over a decade, embraced the affordances of the digital right after Hurricane Sandy hit New York. He headed out with his iPhone and subsequently posted images of the effects of the storm on Instagram. The gritty reality of Roye’s images and the humanizing elements of his accompanying lengthy captions — unusual on the social media platform at the time — grew his following. His insistence on lengthy captions to add dimensions to his already-striking images on Instagram means he deliberately pushes against the boundaries of how the social media platform is  “supposed”  to be used, creating what Moya Bailey calls  “digital alchemy.”  As Bailey writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alchemy is the  “science”  of turning regular metals into gold. When I discuss digital alchemy I am thinking of the ways that women of color, Black women in particular, transform everyday digital media into valuable social justice media magic that recodes failed dominant scripts. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><br>
“Social justice media magic”  is what Ruddy Roye has been making with his Instagram account for the past five plus years. In an interview about his objectives with his work, Roye is not shy about his ambitions. He states,  “a photographer once told me, about 13 years ago, that photography does not change anything. I have been trying to prove that photographer wrong ever since”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. If anyone is using digital tools to react and respond and  <em>make change</em>  in the moment, it is certainly Ruddy Roye. In one of his trademark mini-essays on a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BYTNVZnlnNo/?taken-by=ruddyroye">2017 Instagram post</a> from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, he reflects on traditional works of art and what he calls  “places that hold art,”  asking:  “who do we do this work for, what spaces should the work occupy, who gets to see the work, who gets to tell the work, and on what platform should the work be told to achieve maximum engagement?”  These are the questions of community and access that identity-based studies have historically asked and that digital humanities scholars are asking more explicitly today. Roye’s own work with the digital implies some of the answers even as it merely clears space for him to continue asking the questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moya Bailey’s theorization of digital alchemy grew from her work with black trans women and the ways they build community through and across digital platforms. Along with the concept of digital alchemy, Bailey presents in this article the ethics of such work; encouraging academics to think, from the outset, of designing a project with explicit questions about how what we do as scholars might affect the community or communities we study. In the spirit of Ruddy Roye, who insists that his photographs show his  <em>collaborators</em>  rather than his subjects, Bailey also involved members of the black trans community in designing her investigation of their use of digital platforms. She directly asked: how can this project answer not only my research questions, but also questions that black trans women themselves might have about their networks?</p>
<p>Bailey positions this as a feminist approach to digital humanities work, but I would argue that it also grows out of the tenets of black studies, which has at its heart the historically activist mandate to work towards self-determination and self-definition for black peoples. With the institutionalization within the academy of departments and programs for Africana and African-Diasporic Studies and related fields, there is a growing community of scholars who themselves may be seen as the community for whom we do this work. That is, though the digital humanities may often overlap with  “public humanities”  and may be asking questions directly relevant to, or responding to, a non-academic audience, it is also possible for the intended audience to be specifically academic.</p>
<p>I turn here back to the moment of defining DH; in his introduction to the 2012 edition of  <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> , Matthew Gold writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, this is a significant moment of growth and opportunity for the field, but it has arrived amid larger questions concerning the nature and purpose of the university system. At stake in the rise of the digital humanities is not only the viability of new research methods (such as algorithmic approaches to large humanities data sets) or new pedagogical activities (such as the incorporation of geospatial data into classroom projects) but also key elements of the larger academic ecosystem that supports such work. <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup><br>
The larger questions of the  “nature and purpose”  of academia have come to include questions of activism and public intellectualism in recent years (both not least facilitated by the digital itself). It is not that activism is new to the university — think here of service learning courses as precursors — but that the public nature of digital humanities work, or the forced public nature of it, alongside a heavier emphasis on  “assessment”  and  “outcomes,”  has meant that the humanities must more transparently (and measurably) serve a tangible and visible purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As unpopular as it may be to say it, however, we also have to serve ourselves. We — academics, humanists, Caribbeanists — have to make information and tools available to others in our discipline so that the discipline may itself survive to serve our students and, perhaps by extension, the larger public. As we increasingly recognize the integration of digital humanities into the interdisciplinary margins of the academy, we cannot afford to accept what Gold describes as the  “fault line…between those who use new digital tools to aid relatively traditional scholarly projects and those who believe that DH is most powerful as a disruptive political force that has the potential to reshape fundamental aspects of academic practice”   <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. In order to be disruptive, we must also shore up traditional forms of academic research and publication.</p>
<p>This is not a new argument and not my argument here. I draw attention to it in order to speak again to the question of relevance. The focus in that question of relevance tends to be too much on a non-academic public. Or rather, too much on the direct impact of a DH project or initiative on that  <em>imagined</em>  non-academic public. But that impact, that relevance, can — and in some cases, should — be a multi-step process. For example, a project like the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/esss/">Slave Societies Digital Archive</a> is purposely directed toward researchers. Formerly known as the Ecclesiastical and Secular Sources for Slave Societies, the project is a preservation initiative housed at Vanderbilt University. It digitizes, and in some cases preserves in analog format, records from churches and municipal and provincial archives in what were the Iberian colonies in the Caribbean and Latin America. It is a massive archiving project that has at its heart the mission to provide  “full and complete open global access to these documents. In particular, [for] researchers in and of Latin America and the Caribbean to have increased access to their own histories”   <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. According to Angela Sutton, project fellow at Vanderbilt,  “The availability of these records has allowed historians, both academic and public, to re-create the histories of Cuba and Brazil in a more representative fashion, centering on the Africans whose forced labor built these nations.”  2017  “Google Analytics reports show that the ESSSS site received nearly 50,000 unique visitors monthly”  and the digitized  “records have been and are currently being used to produce [several] doctoral dissertations and master’s theses”  as well as course content and teaching tools. Such digital projects as the Slave Societies Digital Archive, then, are responding directly to a research-based, or pedagogical, need rather than an explicit public need, though the line between academic and public audience cannot in most cases be firmly drawn.</p>
<p>However, the positioning of an academic audience as the direct beneficiary of a digital project, particularly a project designed to speak to the needs of research on communities underrepresented in academic spaces, is an activist mission in itself. The success of Caribbean scholars is a part of my own objective with <a href="http://www.smallaxe.net/sxsalon">sx salon</a> and was a major part of the conversation when I worked with Alex Gil, Kaiama Glover, and Dennis Tenen on refining the ideology and design of <a href="http://smallaxe.net/sxarchipelagos">sx archipelagos</a>. In particular, we prioritized access to research material, mentoring, and publication opportunities for scholars from outside the US. In asking what it is that the Digital Humanities does for the nebulous public, we run the risk of overlooking this very important community of scholars who need support in generating positive social change in the classroom. Admittedly, my understanding of the question of relevance and activism in the Digital Humanities is supported by, and inseparable from, my commitment to Caribbean studies. My choices to use digital tools for research, digital methods of analysis, and digital dissemination and presentation of scholarship are already tied to a much earlier decision to center the Caribbean and Caribbean peoples in spaces my training gives me the privilege to occupy; whether that be the classroom, or digital platforms, or this journal.</p>
<p>Having been too often in the position of claiming and justifying space for Caribbean literature in English departments, and for Caribbean studies in interdisciplinary spaces, I understand the efforts at defining the digital humanities for academic gatekeepers skeptical of what DH is and does. And I understand the desire to define for ourselves the relevance of the work we do for the communities we engage with and belong to. But, we need to be careful of how we frame the current attention to DH activism. Careful that in our framing of this moment, we don’t write a history of the digital humanities that excludes projects like Kwame Dawes’  <em>Live Hope Love</em>  and Thomas Spears’ long-running Francophone site, <a href="http://ile-en-ile.org/">Ile-en-Ile</a>, projects that have always had contemporary communal self-determination and the betterment of the lived experiences of marginalized peoples at the center of their mission. Careful that we don’t relegate projects like the Slave Societies Digital Archive or publications like  <em>sx archipelagos</em>  to outside this  “moment”  or irrelevant to activist genealogies because their explicit audience is academic.</p>
<p>These are some additional dimensions of the reaction, response and relevance of digital humanities that I wish to insist not only into the histories of DH, but also into the now now now of workshop weeks and lightning-fast, immediate-results-oriented activism. To present a deeper and broader picture of what it means to depend on the digital to redress social inequality and generate positive social change. This defining DH moment corresponds with increasing recognition of work being done by digital humanists already committed to diverse minority communities and, therefore, it goes beyond questions of building vs interpreting, beyond who’s in and who’s out. One can  “hack or yack”  all one wants, but if either is divorced from a real-time community, then what use is it?</p>
<p>Engaging with real-time communities, however, necessitates caution, with all forms of DH activism, that we don’t in our rush to be  “timely, political, and radical”  become a cadre of privileged DHers  “doing for”  underprivileged populations in ways that make us feel relevant; and then patting ourselves on the back (while also accepting the rewards and accolades of the academy) for our benevolence. The caution is that, like Roye and Bailey, we collaborate with our communities, rather than see them as subjects of our work.</p>
<h2 id="heading-2"></h2>
<p>In closing, I’d like to turn to a different defining moment, this time in Caribbean studies. In a special issue on  “What is Caribbean Studies,”  David Scott asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the picture that informs our various imaginaries (scholarly, fictive, visual, poetic) of the Caribbean as a space of investigation? What is the content of the form of that image and what is the rhetorical labor that it performs? What is the  <em>point</em>  (political, conceptual, disciplinary, moral) of mobilizing this particular image, rather than some other, of the Caribbean in these particular discourses? <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><br>
It’s not a one-to-one analogy, but I think the theme of this NYCDH week — DH in the Moment: Reaction, Response, Relevance — is asking a similar question of the digital humanities. What is the image we have of the digital humanities? What is the image we have of who we are and what we do and how what we do might be in service with and for our various other communities? What is the  <em>point</em>  of imaging ourselves thus, of defining ourselves in this way at this moment? And how might it spur us to change this thing we call the digital humanities?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some ways, I am asking us to revisit the question of  “what is the digital humanities”  from the perspective not so much of what we do, but what we do  <em>for</em>  and  <em>with</em>  our diverse publics. In clearly defining our digital humanities efforts in terms of audience and communities, we can more ethically engage with those audiences and communities, and more ethically serve both our and their needs for information and digital tools and platforms.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Although the predominant mode of the academic discourse in the humanities has relied on text <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, visual formats, such as diagrams and visualizations, have always held an essential role for knowledge production <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. With a growing recognition of digital humanities approaches towards literary text analysis and interpretation, visualizations of textual data are becoming more and more prominent. But despite the recent rise of digital methods, most visualization techniques for literary studies still exhibit an epistemological imbalance to communicating results, but seldom generating new knowledge. One facet of this reduction to presentation is the use of visualization as unquestioned data representations denying its interactive potential. However, the results of recent research on text visualization demonstrate the potential of interactive visualization for a broad range of linguistic and literary analyses <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. While many existing techniques rely on basic linguistic categories, often automatically extracted through natural language processing (e.g., <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>), results from recent collaborations among visualization researchers and literary scholars highlight the virtues of interdisciplinary research (e.g., <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>). Connected with this line of research, our work explores the potential of text visualizations that are explicitly suited to support narratological analysis. In this paper, we introduce an explorative visualization (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>) as a heuristic method to augment a multi-layered interpretative examination of annotated literary text, in particular with regard to its narrative levels and temporal phenomena.</p>
<p>The paper is structured as follows: In section 2, we discuss prior work in text visualization, especially for the purpose of literary analysis. Section 3 is dedicated to the narratological principles relevant to our project. The visualization design process and principles are presented in section 4; and section 5 finally demonstrates the heuristic value of the visualization as applied to a test corpus of eight German novellas. In closing, we reflect on the results and discuss directions for future research.</p>
<h2 id="2-related-work">2. Related Work</h2>
<p>With our research we seek to devise a specific visualization technique that emphasizes the particular patterns and characteristics that literary scholars conducting narratological analysis are especially interested in. To consider related research on text visualization, we can differentiate between three main approaches:<br>
Gaining an overview over structural features of an entire story,  Studying features and qualities of individual text passages, and  Shifting back and forth between individual passages and the whole text.</p>
<p>While the specific structures and qualities may differ, these approaches apply more generally to many areas of text analysis and literary studies. The potential of text visualization for the purpose of literary and linguistic analysis has already been shown multiple times (e.g., <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>). We briefly discuss prior work as it relates to our objective to support narratological analysis.</p>
<p>Many text visualizations focus on the syntactic or lexical structure of a document to provide a visual overview comprised of patterns and relationships. The most commonly and casually used text visualization is the tag cloud, in which the varying font sizes indicate word frequency <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. The common criticism that tag clouds decontextualize the displayed words can be (somewhat) addressed through interactive arrangements <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> and the integration of a keyword-in-context views ( “kwic” , <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>) or a  “word tree” , a hierarchical text visualization resembling a dynamic concordance <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. The  “phrase net”  technique relies on networks to show syntactic and user-defined relations between words in a text <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Manually annotated text corpora can also be visualized at relatively high level, with the resulting views appearing far removed from the underlying documents and passages <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While a given text visualization technique may focus on a particular linguistic or literary category, a range of visualization environments demonstrate the potential of multiple views for multi-faceted text analysis <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Close collaborations among visualization and literature scholars can yield highly specific representations for data sets and tasks <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. For example, the  “Speculative W@nderverse”  features a multi-view interface that incorporates hierarchical, temporal, and material qualities of a unique literature collection. Building on this line of work, we seek to devise a visualization technique particularly pertaining to narratological features that can range from single words to multiple pages.</p>
<p>Especially with regard to the analysis of narrative levels it is important to preserve the original order of the text and being able to scrutinize different levels in their surrounding context. When considering these two requirements, there are two kinds of text structure visualizations to consider: visualizations of narrative or plot. In either case, most of these visualizations are based on character interactions in different scenes in drama or movie scripts, which can automatically be extracted as they are well-structured. In 2009, several hand-crafted visualizations appeared on the webcomic xkcd to show character interactions in popular Hollywood movies <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. This visualization known as storylines has shown to be very popular, not only among the webcomic’s audience, but also in the information visualization community. There are a number of works building on this visualization style and trying to turn it into generative visualization algorithms (<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>). While these techniques are highly relevant for our work, we are particularly interested to examine the hierarchical and temporal characteristics in the progression of the narrative. The storylines technique has been extended to include the representation of non-linear story developments by arranging sessions (events) as layers on a hierarchical circular layout <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. While resembling our visualization in appearance, the hierarchical layer position does not reflect narrative level, nor story, but is calculated based on the length of sessions and a space-compression algorithm. In contrast to the aforementioned visualizations, the story curves interface allows scholars to compare different narrative features and relate narrative order and chronological order of events <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. In addition to the representation of order, we seek to find an adequate representation for temporal duration and frequency.</p>
<p>The term  “close reading”  describes the traditional scholarly way of interpreting a text by reading it repeatedly, underlining or highlighting text passages, and registering observations in the margin of a book page. Depending on the type of text and its context, attempts to translate this activity to the digital realm have more or less resulted in views reproducing the analog context <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. There are certain use cases, like the analysis of poems, in which scholars study structural or sonic features on the word or sentence level <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. For the purpose of narratological analysis of short stories and novels, a combination of a simple close reading view and an overview visualization may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>A recent survey of text visualization techniques for close and distant reading shows that the number of works that combine both perspectives is increasing <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. On the one hand, the ability to swiftly move from an overview visualization to a close reading view seems to align with the workflows of humanities scholars. On the other hand, this duality is an application of the longstanding visualization truism    “Overview first, zoom and filter, details-on-demand”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  . However, only few text visualizations fully support deliberate shifts between distant and close reading views. One exception is VarifocalReader, an interface that offers multiple levels of abstraction of scanned and transcribed text <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In sum, while there is a great variety of text visualizations designed to support a sense of overview and allow for comparison of textual structures, research on visualization interfaces that support the continuous switching between close and distant levels is still scarce. Furthermore, existing visualizations of narrative structures remain fairly limited and fail to reveal more nuanced narratological features.</p>
<h2 id="3-on-narratological-analysis">3. On Narratological Analysis</h2>
<p>This section is dedicated to elaborating the analysis tasks and data structures that are common in narratological analysis of literary texts, more specifically, the analysis of the narrative level structure and the temporal representation in these texts. The data used for this research was generated in a computer-assisted, collaborative annotation approach.</p>
<h2 id="31-narratological-analysis">3.1 Narratological Analysis</h2>
<p>One of the main objectives of literary studies is to develop plausible and innovative interpretations of literary texts. In a first approach to interpreting literary narratives, it can be helpful to start with a narratological analysis of the text. Narratology is widely regarded to provide analytic categories that allow for a systematic, detailed, and often intersubjective description of narratives. These descriptions can then serve as a heuristic for interpretation <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>: They point out interesting structural or thematic features of the texts – and one important objective of interpreting the text may lie in finding an explanation of why the text exhibits these particular features.</p>
<p>Since narratological analyses are considered a heuristic tool, literary scholars need a way to fruitfully explore these analyses so that they can develop interpretation hypotheses from them. Such an exploration, however, is complicated by the fact that narratological analyses can get very complex and fine-grained – and they are usually scattered throughout the (sometimes rather long) texts, which makes it difficult to get an adequate overview. If the analysis is aimed at comparing different narrative texts across a corpus, its exploration becomes even more difficult.</p>
<p>The special challenge for literary scholars developing interpretations with the help of narratological analyses then lies in being able to switch back and forth between an explorative overview over their analysis results and a close view on individual text passages that seem especially interesting and require a more thorough examination. This iterative process of oscillating between part of the text and the text as a whole is a characteristic feature of hermeneutic text understanding and has been described as the hermeneutic circle <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> or hermeneutic spiral <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> in literary theory.</p>
<p>In the following, we discuss the specific characteristics of the two narrative phenomena our research focuses on: narrative levels and temporal aspects of narrative representation.</p>
<h2 id="32-narrative-levels">3.2 Narrative Levels</h2>
<p>The term narrative level refers to the phenomenon of embedded narrations that can occur within the ‘frame narration’ of a literary text.</p>
<p>The concept of narrative level is special in at least two respects:<br>
Narrative level is an especially important and basic narratological concept insofar as the segmentation of a text according to narrative levels as well as the classification of each level heavily influences the analysis of many other narrative phenomena. To analyze a narration according to its narrative level structure is thus well-suited as a first explorative step with which to start a narratological analysis.  Though basic, the narrative level concept is a very complex narratological category. Narrative levels may occur multiply nested and can be distinguished according to a multitude of parameters. The complexity of the phenomenon poses a challenge for a heuristically powerful visualization concept.</p>
<p>According to Ryan’s account <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>, the most basic narrative in a text constitutes the primary narration. New, embedded narrative levels can then occur within this primary narration, where they constitute so-called secondary narrations. If new, embedded narrations then emerge from a secondary level, they are called tertiary narrations – and so on. The degree of embedding (primary, secondary, tertiary etc.) is one crucial parameter to consider in narrative level analyses.</p>
<p>A new, embedded narrative level occurs whenever an illocutionary or an ontological boundary is crossed. An illocutionary boundary is crossed whenever a new, embedded speaker or narrator occurs, e.g., when a character in the text rises to speak<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> . An ontological boundary, on the other hand, is crossed whenever a new system of reality or  “world”  occurs in a narration. This is, for example, the case when an entirely new fictional world is narrated in a text – but also if a narrative contains other kinds of  “non-actual”  passages, like hopes, dreams, wishes, illusions, etc. Since illocutionary and ontological boundary crossings can occur in combination, but also independently of each other, this makes for three possible combinations:<br>
illocutionary and ontological boundary crossed;  illocutionary boundary crossed, ontological boundary not crossed;  illocutionary boundary not crossed, ontological boundary crossed.</p>
<p>The narrative level analysis is further complicated by the fact that both types of boundaries can be crossed in two different modes: either actually or virtually. In the case of illocutionary boundaries, an actual crossing occurs whenever the utterance of a new speaker/narrator is quoted directly – a virtual crossing, on the other hand, occurs when the new speaker’s utterance is presented in indirect speech. In the case of ontological boundary transgressions, an actual crossing occurs whenever the new, embedded world is presented as new reality. Virtual crossings, on the other hand, occur when the text contains constant reminders of the counterfactual status of the new, embedded world. If we now consider both the type of boundary that is crossed (illocutionary or ontological) and the mode of the crossing (actual or virtual), this now makes for eight possible combinations (<a href="#figure02">Fig. 2</a>).<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup></p>
<p>As becomes immediately clear, a thorough narrative level analysis has to account for so many different parameters (distribution, degree of embedding, narrator, type of crossed boundary, mode of boundary crossing) that it is very challenging to get an adequate overview of all relevant parameters in one representation.<br>

<h2 id="33-temporal-aspects-of-narrative-representation">3.3 Temporal Aspects of Narrative Representation</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, narrative level analyses directly influence a number of further narratological analyses – even some of the presumably basic and straightforward ones. We would like to illustrate this by taking temporal narratological analysis as an example. According to Genette <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>, the temporal structure of narratives can be analyzed according to three categories: order (is the story presented chronologically or not?), frequency (how often are the events of the story narrated?), and duration (how long does the narration of the story events take?).</p>
<p>Now, there are two interesting ways in which an analysis of the narrative level structure of a text and a temporal analysis relate to each other:<br>
As detailed in <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>, the analysis of narrative levels influences the temporal analysis in such a way that a thorough and reasonable temporal analysis is only possible if it is preceded by a narrative level analysis.  There are a number of potentially interesting questions concerning the correlation between narrative levels and temporal aspects: (a) Analepses ( “flashes back”  in time) and prolepses ( “flashes forward”  in time, <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> can either be presented by a primary narrator who thus deliberately holds an organizing function – or the primary narrator can  “delegate”  the navigation through time to secondary narrators. (b) In the case of repetitively narrated events, it can be useful to analyze whether these reports can be attributed to the same narrator or whether different narrators contribute their perspective on the relevant event. Also, if the different accounts of the same event are distributed across narrative levels, it might be interesting to check whether accounts on deeper embedded levels – due to their being mediated around several corners – are less reliable. (c) As for the analysis of duration, it might be a worthwhile task to explore whether there are significant occurrences between embedded narrative levels and either of the three duration categories (isochrony, summary, or scene).</p>
<h2 id="34-collaborative-annotations-as-a-test-bed-for-visualization">3.4 Collaborative Annotations as a Test Bed for Visualization</h2>
<p>To carry out narratological exploration, it is first necessary to find a way of recording or documenting the analysis results. An especially effective way of doing this is via computer-aided, taxonomy-based annotation: With the help of programs like CATMA <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, narratological categories can be organized into hierarchically structured tagsets, and a theoretically unlimited number of categories can be assigned to individual text passages. Computer-aided text annotation has the additional advantage that literary scholars are encouraged to read the text very carefully (i.e., close reading). The benefits of annotation can be increased if different scholars are working on them collaboratively: By discussing their annotations – especially in the case of disagreement – the collaborating scholars can refine their annotation decisions, test definitions of narratological categories, and identify relevant relations between different narrative phenomena <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The data we use in this paper is indeed annotation data that was created in the computer-aided, collaborative annotation project heureCLÉA (2013–2016, <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>). The text corpus for the project was constituted of 21 German short stories by different authors from and around the 19th century. The tagset that was used to conduct the annotations <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> first consisted of basic linguistic temporal categories as well as Genette’s narratological temporal categories, and was soon enhanced to include a subtagset for the analysis of narrative levels as the influence between the two phenomena became obvious in the annotation process.</p>
<p>Concerning the temporal subtagsets used in the project, only the ones comprising Genette’s categories order, frequency, and duration – and only the basic tags corresponding to these categories – are pertinent for the  <em>Narrelations</em>  visualization. Since these basic tags and their application is rather straightforward, we will not go into further detail here <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> . The annotation schema for narrative levels, however, is more complex and requires further description.<br>

<p>The tagset for the annotation of narrative levels (<a href="#figure03">Fig. 3</a>) comprises five tags defining the degree of embedding (primary narration, secondary narration, etc.). In the rare case that deeper degrees of embedding occur, additional tags can be added. Usually, the narrative text as a whole is annotated with the primary narration tag. Whenever, within a primary narration, a passage constituting an embedded narration occurs, it is annotated as secondary narration, etc. For example, in Frank Wedekind’s  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em> , the primary narration (<a href="#figure04">Fig. 4, gray underline</a>) is conducted by a homodiegetic narrator. After a short introduction, a secondary embedded narration (salmon underline) occurs.<br>

</figure></p>
<p>Each tag of the narrative levels tagset, starting from secondary narration, includes two predefined properties (illocutionary boundary and ontological boundary), each with three possible values (actually crossed, virtually crossed, not crossed). These properties and values are used to document the type and mode of boundary crossing that constitutes the new narrative level. For example, the first embedded narration in  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  is constituted by one of the narrated characters, Fanny, becoming a narrator. As can be seen in the bottom right area (<a href="#figure04">Fig. 4</a>), the value for illocutionary boundary is set to actually crossed since Fanny functions as embedded narrator and is directly quoted, and the value for ontological boundary is set to not crossed since Fanny’s utterance concerns the same world as the primary narration.</p>
<p>Every text was annotated by at least two annotators in the course of an iterative process <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> – the annotated corpus can be accessed online <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. While the task of developing an automated annotation functionality from the annotation data yielded fruitful results,<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  the narratological analysis data created in the project has not yet been evaluated to find out more about the texts of the test corpus in the context of interpretations. The visualization presented in this paper paves the way to tackle this interesting task.</p>
<h2 id="4-visualizing-narrative-levels-in-correlation-with-temporal-phenomena">4. Visualizing Narrative Levels in Correlation with Temporal Phenomena</h2>
<p>Narratological analysis poses an intriguing research area for information visualization as it requires the examination of a dataset at multiple scales and from multiple viewpoints. Building on the specific practices of literary scholars who pursue narratology and the particular data structures involved, we aim to conceive a visualization technique that is specifically suited for narratological analysis, i.e., it enables the informative examination of narrative levels along multiple analytical categories in relation to multiple temporal phenomena. Building on the preceding domain characterization of narratological analysis, we hope to address the following specific design goals:<br>
Create overview of narrative levels. A visualization designed for narratological analysis should primarily provide an overview of the nesting and distribution of narrative levels forming the essential structure of every story. Facilitating access to this complex narratological topic through visual representation may provide new insights into the mechanisms of storytelling and show hidden patterns to literary scholars.  Reveal temporal aspects linked with narrative levels. An important aspect of nested narrations in stories is their temporal order, frequency, and duration in relation to the events they narrate. Scholars of narratology need to inspect the correlations between the narrative levels and temporal phenomena to perform the appraisal of the multi-layered structures of narration in stories. The integrated representation of narrative levels and temporal aspects may foster a deeper understanding of narrative structures.  Couple visual analysis with text reading. The high-level analysis of an entire text through the use of visualization (distant reading) should be as integrated as possible with the close inspection of specific text passages (close reading). The visualization should support the scholar to shift between these modes of analysis to encourage discoveries of patterns at different granularities.  Enable focus on specific annotations. A visualization of multiple structural and temporal aspects of narrative levels may be visually complex and overwhelming. In order to support the focused analysis of specific narrative phenomena, interactive mechanisms should be provided that allow for the filtering of annotations along meaningful narratological categories.</p>
<p>These design goals (DGs 1–4) provide a set of guiding principles for an iterative and collaborative design process carried out in an interdisciplinary team consisting of interface designers, visualization developers, and literary scholars. Next, we summarize the design process, after which we present the resulting visualization and the findings from a usability test.</p>
<h2 id="41-design-process">4.1 Design Process</h2>
<p>The entire research approach and design process – from devising initial visualization ideas and refining design concepts to developing a functional prototype and evaluating the epistemic potential of the resulting visualization – was iterative and collaborative. Since our aim was to develop a visualization suitable for narratological analysis, a fruitful exchange of knowledge ensued between visualization research and literary studies. The process was also characterized by the constant interplay of designing and evaluating visual representations.<br>

<h2 id="411-speculative-sketches">4.1.1 Speculative Sketches</h2>
<p>Due to the complexity of narratological analyses of literary texts we set up a co-creation workshop <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> bringing together students and researchers of design and literature. The aim was to encourage participants (incl. ourselves) to approach and examine stories in unconventional ways that go beyond the linearity of printed text and the rigidity of existing text analysis software. A range of crafting materials and tools (such as threads, stickers, paper sheets, Post-Its, pens, glue etc.) was provided to creatively work with printed texts and arrange them as figured fragments into collages or sketches. In this way, we used visual means of low complexity to devise and discuss abstract ideas and approaches to narrative. While the main categories of narratological analysis provided an important backdrop for this exercise, we avoided thinking too specifically about designing an interface. Instead, the aim was to create a casual approach to the complex topic of visualizing literary narratives, to tease out new ideas and perspectives in a visual way, and to gauge the potential for visual representations of text. During the presentation of the first speculative sketches (<a href="#figure05">see Fig. 5</a>), the initial feedback suggested that the circular form of the visualization could support the examination of narrative levels in combination with temporal aspects.<br>

<p>By providing the annotated short stories of the heureCLÉA project it was possible to develop a visualization design that relied on actual data (<a href="#figure06">see Fig. 6</a>). To start working with a specific text, we chose the short story  <em>Lili</em>  by the German author Johannes Proelß (1883), with which we continued working on throughout the next steps. With specific attention to the narratological concepts, we further developed the design concept and visual encoding, which was followed by feedback including suggestions for modification and improvements from a literary point of view, which was again followed by a revision and adaption of the design.<br>

<p>In further steps, the focus was put on developing interaction capabilities for the visual implementations of the narratological concepts. In order to devise and explore different interaction capabilities we created animations demonstrating them and the subsequent display changes (<a href="#figure07">see Fig. 7</a>).</p>
<h2 id="413-functional-prototype">4.1.3 Functional Prototype</h2>
<p>Following positive expert evaluations from the literary scholars of the team, the next step was to develop a web-based prototype in order to visualize different data sets (i.e., annotated stories), refine the interface and interaction capabilities, and more extensively test the potential of the visualization. Furthermore, the prototype allows for a narratological comparison of several short stories, which will be discussed in detail in section 5.</p>
<h2 id="414-usability-evaluation">4.1.4 Usability Evaluation</h2>
<p>To better understand how comprehensible and accessible the visualization would be for other literary scholars beyond our team, we conducted a usability test with an external group of potential users. A usability test helps to uncover issues, which can subsequently be analyzed to identify their causes and inform the refinement of the interface. We performed the test with five researchers and students in literary studies and one cultural scholar. After a few questions about the participants’ professional background and a brief explanation of narratological concepts, the main part consisted of the participants’ description of first impressions of the tool and nine tasks to be solved with the help of the interactive visualization. We used the thinking-aloud method <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>, during which participants articulate their actions, thoughts, and opinions aloud while using an interface. After the test, we requested more information from the participants about their experiences and the problems during the test in the form of a semi-structured interview and questionnaire. The participants shared general feedback about the overall concept behind the visualization as well as specific suggestions for improvement. The main statements of the feedback were documented in written notes and the screen activities and the audio were recorded. We analyzed these observations by organizing them into different categories (e.g., wording, interaction, visual encoding, interface design) and subject areas (e.g., overall arrangement, text area).</p>

On the right side, a set of filters allow for the selection of specific narrators and narratological categories. In the center of the interface, a circular visualization of the text represents the two main narratological aspects a given story: the circle lines are used for the representation of narrative levels and the circle interior for the temporal phenomena.</p>

<p>The visualization is read in clockwise direction.

The length of one colored element is to scale to the length of the embedded narration (unit: characters). Each color represent one particular speaker. The list of speakers in the filter area is doubling as a legend showing at a glance the number of speakers. The interior of the circle provides space for the examination of three temporal aspects: order, frequency, and duration.</p>
<p>The inner circle line with gray rectangles represents the temporal phenomenon  “order.”  Rectangles pointing outwards indicate prolepses ( “flashes forward” ), rectangles pointing inwards the analepses ( “flashes backward” ). Akin to the embedded narrations, the length of the rectangles are to scale to the length of the respective text segments. By visualizing this phenomenon on another circle line, the connections and correlations between the analepses/prolepses and the embedded narrations can be viewed at a glance.<br>

<p>The repetitively narrated events are visualized by small circles (bubbles) in the circle’s interior and lines connect them with the embedded narrations in which they occur. This visual encoding should enable the quick recognition of how many repetitively narrated events exist in the story (<a href="#figure10">see Fig. 10</a>). The size of one bubble demonstrates the number of reports of one repetitively narrated event, the position is determined by a force-directed layout that places the event bubbles closer to the narration segments in which they occur. In addition, a report of a repetitively narrated event is marked by a dark gray, slightly transparent element within the embedded narration. The length of this mark is to scale to the length of the report of the narrated event (unit: characters). Repetitively narrated events are actions that happen once but are told several times within a story. Therefore the highlighting of multiple reports of one event is important for generating narratological insights and again for identifying the relations with embedded narrations.<br>

<p>The third temporal phenomenon that can be examined in the visualization is  “duration” , which is represented as bright gray, fine-grained dot patterns in the background of the circular visualization (<a href="#figure11">see Fig. 11</a>). We encoded different duration categories as the density of the dots. Since the  “scenes”  are passages in which the time of narrating is longer than the time it took for the narrated events to happen it can be considered as a stretching of time. This aspect of stretching is translated into the visual form of a pattern consisting of dots that repel each other creating a lot of space between them, thus the pattern with the fewest dots visualizes the annotation  “scene” .  “Summaries”  represent a compression of time. Visually translated they are accordingly represented by the pattern with the most dots. The  “isochronies”  are displayed as a dot pattern with a visual density approximately between the two other duration categories. Within the filter, which is working as a legend again, all patterns are assigned to the three mentioned categories of  “duration” .</p>

        <p>Filtering speakers, type and mode of level transgressions enables a focus on specific annotations. Hovering over an embedded narration displays detailed information. Clicking on an embedded narration either in the text (left) or in the visualization (center) locks this segment.

</figure></p>
<p>Hovering over narration elements in the visualization opens a small pop-up window with detailed information about the embedded narration: speaker, type and mode of transgression (<a href="#figure12">see Fig. 12</a>). In addition, the text area scrolls to the corresponding text passage, which is marked by an underlining matching the color of the respective speaker. This coupling between visualization and text also works in reverse. With these interactions and visual supports we want to facilitate the coupling of visual analysis and text reading.</p>
<p>There are also two possibilities to select and lock an embedded narration. Either by clicking on a narration element in the visualization or by clicking on a text passage in the text area. The text of the selected passage is subsequently highlighted with a bold underline and marked with a black border in the visualization. An additional click selection of the locked passage/element, releases the lock again. For the purpose of comparative analysis of several embedded narrations, it is possible to lock multiple text passages and elements, which can be released at once by clicking on the reset button in the lower left corner of the interface.</p>
<p>By selecting the respective filter, one can focus on embedded narrations by a specific speaker (<a href="#figure12">see Fig. 12</a>). In order to keep a clear interface, all the passages and elements that do not pertain to the respective speaker are displayed in a bright shade of gray. Filter selections also allow for the focused consideration of embedded narrations with a certain type and mode of level transgression. There are eight possible combinations for types and modes of boundary crossings (<a href="#figure02">see Fig. 2</a>), which can be selected as filters. The embedded narrations that do not have the selected type and mode of transgression are displayed in a bright shade of gray, both in the text area and the visualization.</p>
<p>The third general function of the filter is the addition of the temporal aspects of narrative representation  “order” ,  “frequency (repetitive)” , and  “duration” . Only one of the three temporal phenomena can be selected at a time. Within  “order”  and  “duration” , additional selections can be made (<a href="#figure09">see Fig. 9</a> and <a href="#figure11">11</a>). When selecting one of the phenomena only the embedded narrations, in which the selected category occurs, retain their opacity and color to ensure the focus and support a quick identification of which passages and elements are relevant for the narratological analysis.</p>
<h2 id="43-findings-of-usability-test">4.3 Findings of Usability Test</h2>
<p>While the reactions of all participants of the usability test were favorable, with several of them expressing interest in using such a tool for their research, the test helped identify several interaction issues.</p>
<p>Four out of the six participants found it difficult to compare two different embedded narrations in the text view: Once a text passage is locked the text does not automatically scroll to the second text passage when hovering over the corresponding embedded narration in the visualization. This fact often led to confusion and distracted the participants since it is subsequently necessary to manually scroll to reach the second text passage or unlock both embedded narrations first in order to hover over the second embedded narration again.</p>
<p>Several confusions related to the consistency of selection interactions. For example, most participants were confused about selecting and locking certain annotations of the temporal phenomena by clicking on them as is the case with the embedded narrations. Four out of six test persons tried to click on the elements representing the analepses/prolepses and repetitvely narrated events, which in the current version of the interface do not provide an additional interactive capability.</p>
<p>Furthermore there were issues with the interaction concerning the repetitively narrated events in the visualization and text view: By hovering over a bubble representing a repetitively narrated event, the viewer can only see one report in the text area. No participant understood how to display the other instances of this event in the text view; multiple click selections would not cycle through the corresponding text passages. In addition, they clicked on the dark gray mark within an embedded narration representing one report of a repetitively narrated event in order to get to this instance in the text, however, this interaction has not been implemented yet.</p>
<p>When the participants had the task to search for a particular text passage they missed an integrated search function within the text area, which allows them to look for specific words, sentences etc. (despite the fact that the browser’s built-in search function can be used for this purpose).</p>
<h2 id="5-merits-for-literary-analysis-and-interpretation">5. Merits for Literary Analysis and Interpretation</h2>
<p>As observed during the usability test, the participants are free to choose their own preferred workflow when interacting with the text. The most common path of using the visualization for literary exploration and interpretation will probably start with the more abstract visual analysis provided by the general overview, then proceed to identifying interesting phenomena/correlations (what stands out?), and finally switch to a more detailed investigation of passages in the text view. This procedure can be iterated to the scholar’s liking. In the following, we will illustrate this path in more detail in two steps. After some explorative observations on the narratological features of eight German novellas, we will pursue the advanced interpretation of three of them in a close reading and contextualization.</p>
<p>Our selected narratives are eight German short stories which were written and published in the 19th century. Most of the eight short stories can be classified as German novella, which is a written fictional text of “indeterminate length” <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> in prosaic form. The content structure of the German novella is often “restricted to a single event, situation or conflict, which produces an element of suspense and leads to an unexpected turning point (Wendepunkt) so that the conclusion surprises even while it is a logical outcome” <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. More precisely, the German novella is often devoted to topics which are in conflict with social conventions <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A specific narrow thematic focus often corresponds with the idea of a concise cutout of an individual life <sup id="fnref1:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. In relation to its sensational topics, however, the theoretical discourse of the German novella reflects different form issues <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. One question in the theoretical discourse of the novella is to which degree the topic addressed by the novella relates to a narratological composition <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. Especially, in comparison to other literary genres, issues of narrative representation and temporality are more foregrounded in the novella, which seems to be a consequence of its relative brevity coupled with the integration of an unexpected turning point <sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Regarding the scientific discourse on the German novella, the characterization of the novella    “has always been very dissatisfying according to traditional genre”   <sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  . As Lubkoll points out,    “typical formal and structural features are often too unspecific and mostly remain on the surface, if their function for the (con)text is not reflected adequately”   <sup id="fnref2:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  .</p>

        </p>

</figure>
<p>When considering the visualizations of all eight narratives side by side, it is easy to make first observations on how the texts differ from one another with regard to their narrative structure in correlation with temporal phenomena (<a href="#figure13">see Fig. 13</a>):<br>
We can see that some texts show a rather regular distribution (e.g., b)  <em>Matteo</em>  with many embedded narrations throughout, f)  <em>Der Tod</em>  and h)  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  with fewer), while others show irregular patterns (e.g., a)  <em>Der Pokal</em>  shows comparatively few embedded narrations in the first half of the narrative and many in the second half).  When it comes to the length of the embedded narrations, some stories (like b)  <em>Matteo</em> ) contain hardly any longer chunks of embedded levels, some contain the occasional larger chunk (e.g., a)  <em>Der Pokal</em>  and d)  <em>Die Kriegspfeife</em> , e)  <em>Lili</em> , and g)  <em>Poverino</em> ), while others (e.g., h)  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em> ) mostly contain medium to large chunks of embedded levels.  If we have a look at the degree of embedding, we can see that only f)  <em>Der Tod</em>  does not contain any embedded narrations on a tertiary level. And the number of the narrators in a text ranges from very few (e.g., h)  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  and f)  <em>Der Tod</em> ) to rather many (g)  <em>Poverino</em> ) – where  <em>Der Tod</em>  shows the additional peculiarity that a large proportion of the (longer) embedded level chunks are narrated by a narrator on the primary level.  Concerning the types and modes of the boundaries crossed in the embedded narrations, we can see that two of the texts (h)  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  and c)  <em>Veronika</em> ) only show one ontological crossing, while others show comparatively many (especially f)  <em>Der Tod</em> , considering that there are few embedded narrations in total). What also sticks out is that every tertiary narration in b)  <em>Matteo</em>  is an ontological crossing.</p>

<p>If we switch on the display of temporal phenomena, we can also make some interesting observations in the inner ring of the circle visualization (<a href="#figure14">see Fig. 14</a>): Concerning temporal order, basically the whole narration in a)  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  is an analepsis carried out by the primary narrator (the same goes for  <em>Die Kriegspfeife</em> ) – and the analepsis is only occasionally interrupted. All embedded narrations occur within the scope of the analepsis. Both a)  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  and b)  <em>Der Tod</em>  also show comparably many prolepses – while c)  <em>Der Pokal</em>  is particularly noteworthy having one longer analepsis in the beginning, but many short ones in the second half correlating with embedded narrations. Other texts, especially d)  <em>Matteo</em> , only contain comparably few and short analepses.<br>

<h2 id="52-interpretation-via-close-reading-and-contextualization">5.2 Interpretation via Close Reading and Contextualization</h2>
<p>After having provided a selected description of the patterns visible in the  <em>Narrelations</em>  interface, the next step is now to investigate whether and, if so, in which way these observations can be related to other formal, content-related, or contextual features of the narratives. While some of the observations point out methodological choices that were made during the annotation process,<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  we would like to demonstrate the heuristic value of the visualization by providing three exemplary text analyses and interpretations of narrative structures of varying complexity – the selected novellas are  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em> ,  <em>Der Tod</em> , and  <em>Matteo</em> .</p>
<h2 id="521--_die-schutzimpfung_">5.2.1  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em></h2>
<p>The novella  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  by Frank Wedekind is about a vaccination as a psychological trick a wife employs to prevent her husband from suspecting her infidelity. As we already gain from the overview of  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  (<a href="#figure13">see Fig. 13, h</a>), the visualization illustrates the structural principle of frame narration, which is a common genre characteristic of the German novella that functions as a bracket around the actual story conveyed in a text. While the border between frame and inner narration can generally be constituted by a persistent boundary crossing, this is not the case for  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em> . As the visualization (coupled with a close reading of the relevant switching passages) shows, it is actually a large – and only occasionally interrupted – analepsis that marks the relevant border between frame and inner narration (<a href="#figure14">see Fig. 14, a</a>). This means that the primary (or frame) narrator of  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  is also the one narrating the inner, actual story in retrospect. The function of the frame narration in  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  is to make the narrator’s act of telling explicit <sup id="fnref3:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. The frame narration of  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  can be characterized as a conversational frame, in which the narrator introduces the audience to the newsworthy    “tellability”   <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>   of a certain psychological oddity, the vaccination.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  Raising the interest of the audience involves in  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  a didactic and moral intent, which seems to cover the sexual sensational content of the story.</p>
<p>In the context of the frame and inner narration structure of  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em> , both these interruptions as well as the passages before and after the large inner narration can be classified as instances of metanarration <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  Especially significant are the first two longer chunks of interruptions in  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em> . These metanarrative comments appear before and after insinuating content is narrated, e.g., the nudity of a woman. The narrator claims that the insinuating content is not narrated to amuse the audience, but rather to provide proof for the surprising ways of human behavior.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the visualization shows that the metanarrative comments tend to correlate with stretchings of time. In this particular context a dash –, which suggests a pause before narrating the sensational content, is used:  “– Sie entledigt sich auch der letzten Hülle und gesellt sich zu mir.”  ( “She gets rid of her last piece of clothing and joins me” ). Regarding the duration phenomena for the whole narration,  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  seems to play with the tension between hastening and slowness, which can, on the one hand, be regarded as analogy to the sexual tension between the two lovers. On the other hand, it has an impact on the affective and attentive dimension of the text between the narrator and the audience. The hesitation of narrating in correlation with the change of duration also creates an ironic tone. Moreover, with respect to the frequency phenomena (<a href="#figure15">see Fig. 15</a>), it seems that the visualization reveals the unexpected ironic turning point of the novella. The event without precedent, i.e., the wife openly telling her husband that she is in love with another man, is narrated twice – by an embedded narrator (the wife) in the first part of the text, and by a second embedded narrator (her husband) in the last part of the text.</p>
<p>As this short interpretative approach demonstrates, the visualization – coupled with close reading – both points out some significant correlations between the narrative levels and temporal phenomena, and elicits a critical reflection on a genre specific issue, i.e., the covering of the sensational content with a specific narrative and temporal structure.</p>
<h2 id="522--_der-tod_">5.2.2  <em>Der Tod</em></h2>
<p>The visual exploration of Thomas Mann’s  <em>Der Tod</em>  (1897) invites an interpretation of both form and content that pays particular attention to the interdependencies between the concepts for temporal analysis and narrative levels. As we can see at a glance in <a href="#figure13">Fig. 13 (f)</a>, this novella appears with only two narrative levels and only a few embedded narrations as outliers.  <em>Der Tod</em>  consists of 14 journal entries made by a count, who believes his own death will occur on his 40th birthday, October 12th. The journal’s entries revolve around the anticipation of that day.</p>
<p>The dominant primary narrative level appears to correspond to the stream of consciousness or interior monologue of the count facing death. The flow of inner experiences and feelings passing through the mind of the count is evidenced by the dominant length of the primary level. Concerning the embedded narrations, it is important to mention that several of them are narrated by the experiencing I of the primary narrator. The simultaneous presence of the experiencing I in an embedded narration and the primary narrator at the primary level reinforces the stream of consciousness of the dying count and the egocentric focus of his multi-level narration.</p>
<p>Regarding the boundaries, it is also noteworthy that  <em>Der Tod</em>  shows many ontological boundaries with virtual crossings (7 out of 17 embedded narrations). Taking a close look at the respective text segments, it is apparent that the ontological boundaries consist of the narrator’s anticipations of death. Although the count is still alive and seems to be impatiently waiting for his own death, the ontological transgressions suggest the yet counterfactual status of death within the story. However, the fact that some of the narrator’s anticipations have been interpreted as prolepses (i.e., anticipations of actual events in the story) by the annotators undermines this impression and reveals an interesting ambiguity concerning temporality and transience in  <em>Der Tod</em> .</p>
<p>As becomes clear, the visualization enables us to gain a deeper understanding of how  <em>Der Tod</em>  plays with the element of decay of life by employing a specific narrative structure. Further research could address the more general question of how death and mortality are represented in the German novella with regard to narrative and temporal structure.</p>
<h2 id="523--_matteo_">5.2.3  <em>Matteo</em></h2>
<p>With the third exemplary analysis of Friedrich Hebbel’s  <em>Matteo</em>  (1839), we would like to explore more multilayered correlations between narrative structure and temporality. The novella tells the story of a young man of virtue, Matteo. After a disease, which deformed his handsome appearance, Matteo has to deal with female rejection and social humiliation. Hebbel’s novella reflects on the challenge of virtuousness in an unjust and ruleless society, where fate and inconsistency disempower human behaviour.</p>
<p><em>Matteo</em>  shows many embedded narrations of short length throughout the whole narration (<a href="#figure13">see Fig. 13, b</a>). Concerning the content structure, it appears that the distribution and short length of the embedded narrations correlate with Matteo’s life, which is falling apart. The cascade of injustice bestowed upon Matteo leads him to see the world as  “unsinniges Kaleidoskop”  ( “unreasonable kaleidoscope” ) without rules or purpose. The idea of life without reasonable meaning seems to manifest itself in the fragmented structure of the novella’s narrative levels.</p>
<p>A closer investigation of the embedded narrations reveals the role of ontological boundary crossings, which mostly occur on the tertiary level throughout the narrative. In contrast, the first ontological crossing is located on the secondary level and consists of a positive, hopeful dream Matteo has. This dream, however, is soon crushed – and from this moment on, all the remaining ontological crossings (mostly hypothetical anticipations of future events) turn out to be negative and calamitous, thus corresponding to Matteo’s deteriorating fate.</p>
<p>If we take a closer look at the frequency phenomena in  <em>Matteo</em> , we can further see that the repeated narration of events does neither concern single events without precedent linked to a human conflict, nor does it serve as bracketing or connecting element in the narrative as it does in  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  or  <em>Der Pokal</em>  (<a href="#figure15">see Fig. 15</a>). Instead, the frequency phenomena are much more isolated and tied to individual text passages, for instance, when Matteo expresses resentment against God.</p>

</figure>
<p>Unlikely for the literary genre of novellas, this analysis indicates that the whole narration is not based on one interpersonal conflict weaving a strong net through the story (as it does, for example, in  <em>Lili</em> ,  <em>Veronika</em> ,  <em>Der Pokal</em> ). Instead,  <em>Matteo</em>  is an example of a more episodic variant of the novella (<a href="#figure17">see Fig. 17</a>).</p>
<p>Another noteworthy aspect relating form and content in  <em>Matteo</em>  is revealed when we closely inspect the organization of temporal order in the narrative. It is striking that there are only a few short analepses in  <em>Matteo</em> . Now, if we conceive of time as a continuum in which the presence is influenced by the past, analepses can be used to reflect on or to find explanations for why certain events happened. Considering the aforementioned issue of inconsistency in  <em>Matteo</em> , one could argue that the specific makeup of order phenomena reinforces Matteo’s view of the world as an unreasonable kaleidoscope without rules and purpose that makes moments of reflection obsolete.</p>

        <p>Visualization shows the duration phenomenon ‘summary’ in <em>Matteo</em> .
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The hurried nature of the narrative becomes also visible in the visualization of duration phenomena emphasizing yet again the pointlessness of being in  <em>Matteo</em> . As shown in <a href="#figure18">Fig. 18</a>, a great amount of text passages is classified as summaries. The predominance of summaries, filling in the spaces between individual episodes in Matteo’s life that are narrated in slower pace, gives the impression of a hastening from one negative experience to the next, and thus of an inescapable fate.</p>
<p>Summarizing the visually supported interpretation of  <em>Matteo</em> , we can say that the  <em>Narrelations</em>  visualization not only points to the more episodic makeup of  <em>Matteo</em> , which distinguishes the narrative from most of the other analyzed texts.  <em>Matteo</em>  is also a good example to show how a multitude of different structural features can be related to overarching thematic aspects of the text – a complex and laborious task that was significantly facilitated by the overview of the visualization and interactive filtering provided by the interface.</p>
<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The visual exploration of three exemplary texts demonstrates the heuristic value of the visualization for narratological analyses and interpretations. While the visualization of  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em>  serves to elicit critical insights in the discourse structure of the novella, the analysis of  <em>Der Tod</em>  shows the visualization as a    “mediator”   <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>   by helping connect the fragmented narrative structure with the decaying life of the narrator. In the final analysis of  <em>Matteo</em> , the visualization helps to understand the significant alliance between content-related and formal issues. With reference to Lubkoll, who claims the academic void that    “the different catalogues of typical features mostly appear as static schemes that cannot do justice equally well to all the various manifestations of the  Novelle  as to the historical change of the genre itself”   <sup id="fnref4:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  , the  <em>Narrelations</em>  visualization enables a dynamic analysis of a single novella as well as critical and comparable insight into the genre of German novellas, for instance, the function of the turning point. It thus seems justified to assume that the visualization tends to serve as explorative and discursive function, rather than merely illustrative purposes that one attends to a posteriori one’s intellectual engagement with a work of literature.</p>
<p>In summary, we have made three main contributions: First, we provided an extensive reflection about the relevance of narratological analysis for literary interpretation, its complex and multilayered makeup, and the difficulty of exploring and evaluating the analysis data. Second, we have presented an interactive visualization technique for narratological analysis of literary works and described the collaborative design process resulting in a specific visual encoding that reveals the nesting and distribution of narrative levels, integrates the representation of temporal phenomena, and facilitates the examination of correlations between these aspects. Third, we utilized the  <em>Narrelations</em>  interface to explore the relationship between literary content of eight German novellas and their respective narrative structures, and thus demonstrated the heuristic value of visualization for literary analysis and interpretation.</p>
<p>This being said, it also seems fair to point out the limitations of the visualization. First of all – and this goes for all kinds of heuristic devices – the  <em>Narrelations</em>  visualization, of course, shows a large number of phenomena and correlations, not all of which are necessarily interesting or relevant. It is always the scholar’s task to appraise the many observations and decide which are meaningful and which are merely coincidental. The possibility to iteratively shift between overview and close reading certainly helps in making these decisions. Second, the visualization certainly does not substitute interpretation at the textual level. What visualization can support, however, is a detailed analysis of the structural makeup of a narrative – the challenge of making sense of it is left to the literary scholar to pursue. And finally, we still have to ask to which extent and in which ways does the visualization help generate new knowledge about narrative form. The observations that we were able to make about the narrative levels of the German novellas were in part guided by the visualization, however, the close reading of the stories constituted an essential part of the research process.</p>

<p>Two examples should be mentioned in this context: (1) In the heureCLÉA project, a rather wide concept of embedded narrative levels via illocutionary crossing was applied: A new level occurs whenever a character in the story rises to speak. This choice explains why some visualizations (e.g., the one for  <em>Matteo</em> , <a href="#figure11">see Fig. 13</a>) show so many micro level chunks with alternating narrators: they simply show passages of quoted dialogue. Embedded narrations (via illocutionary crossing) in the narrower sense are represented by larger level chunks. (2) As we can see, for example, for  <em>Die Schutzimpfung</em> , passages of quoted speech (actual crossings of illocutionary boundaries in embedded levels) always correlate with isochronous narration. This is due to the fact that in heureCLÉA, duration was only annotated on the primary narrative level. The duration annotations and their visualizations thus only show how characters’ speech acts are narrated – but we cannot make any observations concerning the duration of what is told by the characters in the embedded levels.&#160;<a href="#fnref:48" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Printed books still remain persistent in the workflow of scholars even though there is a plethora of digital options available that afford great power and flexibility to the user. Word processors and other applications have been completely integrated into people’s daily lives and have started to replace pen and paper as a modality for interacting with the written word; when it comes to books, the affordances offered by digital platforms such as search and copy are considered paradigm shifting additions to the act of reading. But, even though these tools exist, scholars still write on paper and still have books on their bookshelves. There is a tension that exists between these new digital formats and our history. We often create digital tools to mimic the affordances of books, but while they improve steadily, the weight, smell, and sounds of a book are still unique to bound paper and ink. It is important to note that it is still not known how these affordances affect cognition, and for literary scholarship, interpretation. Mehta et al. studied fourteen literary critics and found that each had idiosyncratic methods of marking up a literary document, but most importantly, all of them engaged in some form of annotation when working with poetic texts <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Our own domain expert, a modernist literary critic, confirmed the findings of that study and presented the idea to us for a system that allows scholars to quickly digitize a document for augmentation but retain the look and feel of the original.</p>

<p>Beyond the affordances of physical texts, many older texts used for research often do not have reliable digital versions, and many corpora are still digitized as images such as Early English Books Online <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The solution we offer is a combination of techniques that bring together the paper and ink history of our past, with the digital affordances of our present. To demonstrate, we present a web-based interface, geared toward researchers, that allows for the quick digitization and augmentation of paper documents. By using any web-based device with a camera or uploading an existing image, Textension allows the user to create interactive digital objects from analog texts that retain the look and feel of the originals.</p>
<p>To start this project, we asked ourselves the question: How can we allow users the ability to interact with both analog and digital text at the same time? Not knowing exactly what we lose when we digitize a text in terms of interpretation or cognition is a much larger problem, and we wanted to address how to interact with these texts without completely discarding the originals. While there are great efforts to digitize the world’s books, such as the Google books projects <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, large-scale OCR projects are difficult to implement. With the growth of digitized text repositories that leverage these technologies, two problems are still outstanding: digitally supporting books that have not yet been digitized, and enabling better use of books that have been digitized as images and are not currently interactive. The flexibility and freedom of digital writing and reading are leading to increasing pressure to digitize texts. However, most of these solutions are costly, time-consuming, and never seem to reach the document of current interest. There is a need for a quick, direct and simple way to gain these freedoms with the document you currently have in hand — whether it is a hand-written letter, an old book, or the newspaper. What we have laid out here is a method for achieving this goal, while still having and keeping the original text close at hand.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a framework that extends the power of the digital to physical books in near real-time. Our contribution is bringing together ideas studied in digital document spaces and existing word-scale visualizations to demonstrate how these known quantities can be leveraged to bridge analog and digital reading and writing. Our framework is informed by previous results describing document spaces and the different ways they are used with analog documents. We outline each of the document spaces and describe how they can be used in tool design, and we implement a prototype to demonstrate the robustness of this framework (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>Through Textension we offer quick access, applicable to the analog text at hand, to an integrated digital/analog environment, only requiring common equipment such as the camera in a phone and a preferred web-enabled device. Simply photograph or upload an existing picture of a document, display it in Textension on a web-browser and start interacting. By making paper documents interactive on mobile devices Textension allows for a smooth transition between our history and our present by allowing users a quick way to digitize documents while working on-site in places like libraries. Our system produces in-line visualizations and interactive elements directly on the newly built digital document, allowing for work to continue while having an augmented digital document at the ready.</p>
<h2 id="related-work">RELATED WORK</h2>
<p>While we present a prototype in this paper, we see our main contribution as a discussion and amalgamation of what is possible when bringing together analog and digital affordances as it relates to text. We see Textension as a way to leverage past studies and computational approaches to natural language to quickly create digital documents from analog texts using readily accessible mobile technology.</p>
<h2 id="paper-and-digital-functionality">Paper and Digital Functionality</h2>
<p>Bridging the affordances of paper documents and digital technologies is not a new pursuit. Many projects have attempted to cross the boundaries between these two modalities to leverage what is best in both.</p>
<p>Early work on Fluid Documents <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> has provided inspiration for working with both analog and digital documents. Bondarenko and Janssen provide an overview of what we can learn from paper to improve digital documents <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, specifically important to this framework is their distinction between the affordances of paper versus digital texts in terms of task management. Supporting active reading using hybrid interfaces has been addressed by Hong et al. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, and Shilit et al. report methods for supporting active reading with freeform digital ink annotations <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, we leveraged these findings as we designed and built our prototype. More recently, Metatation was presented as a pen-based project that supports close reading annotation work on physical paper with a digital interface <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and concluded that pen-based annotations were necessary for the workflow of literary critics. The difference between active and close reading is small but important. Active reading is often discussed as a way to engage in cognitive offloading i.e. note taking, while close reading is a task that is specific to literary criticism where critics use analysis techniques to decipher meanings within a text. We developed the Textension framework to be robust enough to allow for both activities.</p>
<p>Pen-based systems that cross between physical and digital interfaces have also been explored by Weibel et al. <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, and with the introduction of gestures in RichReview <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Gesture-based interactions have also been addressed in Papiercraft, a system which enables gesture-based commands on interactive paper <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, Pacer, a method for interacting with live images of documents using hybrid gestures on a cell phone <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, and Knotty gestures, which presents subtle traces to support interactive use of paper <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Paper-augmented digital documents merge physical annotations on paper with a digital representation <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Paper and digital media have also been used together to support co-located group meetings <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Work has also been done on applying paper affordances to digital workspaces such as page flipping and annotations in e-readers <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. The Paper Windows project <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> projected digital environments onto physical paper allowing for the affordances of both. The TextTearing tool <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> was the inspiration for how we create space in digital documents from analog texts. In our framework, this is done automatically from a picture of an analog text taken in situ with a smartphone or tablet and not simply from an electronic version of the document.</p>
<h2 id="computer-vision-for-document-analysis">Computer Vision for Document Analysis</h2>
<p>Our tool uses several computer vision techniques to aid in the OCR from the camera of a mobile device. The following papers all describe techniques that helped us to consider the problems and solutions of in-the-wild document digitization. Digitizing historical documents is a difficult prospect and the binarization and filtering techniques presented in da Silva’s work <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> provided guidance on working with older texts as would be often found in a humanities setting. Also, Gupta discusses OCR binarization and preprocessing specifically for historical documents <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Much work has been done on document capture using digital cameras including background removal <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, document image analysis <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, and marginal noise removal <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. Liang et al. provided a useful survey of camera-based analysis of text and documents <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Commercial applications such as the WordLens (now part of Google Translate) also integrate text processing and analysis <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. WordLens provides real-time translation of text detected through the mobile camera, creating an augmented reality environment. We build on this concept by matching the vision technology with information visualization and natural language processing tools to enhance document images with rich and task-specific augmentations.</p>
<p>Post-processing for text documents tends to be idiosyncratic to the documents themselves. For example, a document with a completely white background may not need to be gamma corrected. We built into our tool the ability to control multiple processing parameters. Influence for this decision came from work such as perspective correction <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, quality assessment and improvement <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>, and image segmentation <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. There has also been research on tools for these kinds of post-processing tasks. Specifically, Photodoc is a program to aid in document processing acquired by digital cameras <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="text-visualization">Text Visualization</h2>
<p>Text vis is an enormous subsection of information visualization. Rather than a survey of available text visualizations, we have included a list of references that directly affected our work and design decisions. Early text visualizations such as ThemeRiver and TextArc demonstrate novel ways of visualizing text <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. Sparklines over tag clouds have been previously presented by Lee et al. <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. Projects such as SeeSoft <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>, a text-based tool for visualizing segments of programming code, gave us an insight into how portions of a document could be visualized separately to indicate different workspaces. And TileBars <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> showed ways of visualizing document structure at the sentence level. There has been quite a lot of work visualizing document collections, but for our purposes, two of the most relevant projects were Compus <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> and ThemeRiver <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Compus used XML documents to visualize structure in historical manuscripts and ThemeRiver depicted thematic changes over time in document collections. For larger surveys of related work, we suggest the text visualization survey by Kucher and Kerren <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> and a specific treatment of text analysis in the Digital Humanities by Jänicke et al. <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>.</p>

        <p>The Textension framework architecture: images are captured using a mobile device or webcam. The text is extracted by the OCR engine and the digitized text is processed using NLP techniques. The background of the document is detected and synthesized for the insertion of interactive elements. External resources are brought in as needed to create augmentations which combine with the document image to create the final layout on screen. Finally, any interaction queries are fed back to the layout engine and augmentations and an updated output are generated.

<h2 id="word-scale-visualizations">Word-Scale Visualizations</h2>
<p>Perhaps the pioneering work in word-scale visualization was Tufte’s proposal of Sparklines <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>, which are small line charts which reveal trends and work well in small multiples. The different types of possible word-scale visualizations have been explored by Brandes et al. <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>, where they discuss the ideas of Gestalt psychology as it applies to word level visualization. Goffin has explored implementations and effects of word-scale visualizations in depth <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. These include explorations of the history, design, placement within a text, the interactive possibilities of word-scale visualizations, and their impact on reading behavior. Sparkclouds use word-scale visualizations to show trends as a text visualization <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> and Nacenta et al. introduced Fat Fonts, a method for encoding numerical information on the word-scale directly into the text itself <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. There has also been work on producing word size graphics for scientific texts <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>, and a particularly interesting interaction study that investigates eye movement while users engage with word-scale visualizations <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="textension-framework">Textension Framework</h2>
<p>Previous studies on digital document interaction, annotations, e-readers, and marginal interactions <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> have identified five spaces that are interacted with on a digital document: word space, line space, margin space, occlusion space, and canvas space. Mehta discussed word space, line space, and margin space as places of interaction for analog annotation <sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> after studying literary critics working on poetry with pen and paper. Goffin et al. use word space and line space as alternatives for the placement of word-scale visualizations <sup id="fnref2:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Occlusion space or the space above the document has long been an accepted interaction modality, the most famous incarnation being the everyday tooltip. Goffin et al. use this space to provide enlarged maps on text documents <sup id="fnref3:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Canvas space was discussed by Cheema et al. in a paper outlining how to extend documents using external resources such as drag and drop images <sup id="fnref1:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. While each of these spaces represents a unique portion of a digital document where interactive elements can be placed, Textension is a modular system that allows for these elements to be created interchangeably in all document spaces. Our goal is to demonstrate a framework where analog documents can be turned into interactive objects in a short span of time by using the document spaces appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="the-five-interactive-spaces-of-a-digital-document">The Five Interactive Spaces of a Digital Document</h2>
<p>From the previous work, we have identified five different types of spaces in digital documents that can be augmented:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Word Space</strong> : Space inside the bounding boxes of words, lines, and paragraphs.</li>
<li><strong>Line Space</strong> : The space within the bounding box of the text on the page that makes up white space between the lines.</li>
<li><strong>Margin Space</strong> : Space that is outside of the text bounding box but within the boundaries of the document itself.</li>
<li><strong>Occlusion Space</strong> : Any overlay on the document whether permanent or impermanent that covers up the existing text or space.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas Space</strong> : Space that is created outside of the borders of the original text and can be infinitely expanded.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note when discussing document spaces as part of a larger framework that they can be used alone or in concert with each other and that sometimes the lines blur between them. For example, the  <strong>occlusion space</strong>  bounding box of a paragraph includes the  <strong>line spaces</strong>  from that paragraph and the  <strong>word spaces</strong>  above each word. Despite this stacking, it would be possible, for example, to design annotations which are complementary at each level.</p>
<h2 id="defining-document-spaces">DEFINING DOCUMENT SPACES</h2>
<p><strong>Word Space</strong>  is any portion of a document that has the printed word on it. The OCR engine we used, Tesseract, can identify and create bounding boxes around both printed and hand-written words, lines, and paragraphs. Depending on the specific implementation, word space could be considered any or all of these. In an analog book the actual printed type is an element that can be interacted with cognitively, but as we move into digital representations of that text it allows us to alter and query the text in interesting ways. The possibilities here are great, with one of the motivations being simply on-demand OCR. But when the text is digitized it opens up possibilities for text analysis, computational linguistics, and machine learning based on language. Marshall et al. reference both highlighting and annotation as a way that this space is interacted with on paper documents <sup id="fnref1:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Line space</strong>  is any space that exists between existing printed lines but remains inside the bounding box of the entire block of printed text on the page. Digitizing documents using our framework allows for on-demand opening and closing of these spaces. The manipulation of line space can create room for additional elements, such as ink annotations, inserted figures, and data visualizations that relate to the text. We synthesize the background of the document to avoid jarring the reader, and once this is done effectively any amount of space can be added to the document. Previous studies have found that this space is most often used for annotation, specifically in-line notes and for connectors such as arrows between words.</p>
<p><strong>Margin space</strong>  is any area outside of the bounding box of the text but still within the bounds of the original document. This is the space commonly used for free-form note-taking. For example, when studying, editing, or conducting a close reading of a document <sup id="fnref4:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In addition to free-form note-taking, this space can be used for inserting new elements related to the text automatically, such as grammar trees, maps, or simply any placement of third-party or generated images.</p>
<p><strong>Occlusion space</strong>  is a layer that covers the document. Additions in the occlusion space can obscure the text, so semi-transparent and impermanent elements are appropriate to maintain document legibility. In an analog setting, the occlusion space is often used with physical additions such as sticky notes. This space can be accessed in multiple ways, but the underlying function of the space tends to be information that is needed in the moment, but not on a continual basis. We demonstrate how to interact with this space by using tool tips that show the definitions of words on demand. Most of the techniques we demonstrate in this paper could be taken from one of the other spaces and placed into occlusion space, the question of permanence or impermanence will be a decision that rests with the designer.</p>
<p><strong>Canvas space</strong>  is a concept that we could loosely attribute to the desk that a printed book is placed on or the space outside a page of text taped on a whiteboard. When we move to a digital representation of the book, the canvas space could be infinitely expandable allowing for the insertion of larger interactive elements. We have chosen to demonstrate how linguistic analysis could lead to automatic insertion of images, figures, and tables within the canvas space. It is important to note that external images could also be inserted in this space as Cheema et al. propose in AnnotateVis <sup id="fnref2:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="framework-architecture">Framework Architecture</h2>
<p>For this project, we imagined a tool that scholars of the humanities could use to do their required work on printed manuscripts, edited collections, and books, while still having access to digital affordances. Imagine the scenario where a literary scholar is in a rare book archive and cannot write directly on the document, or a scenario where a humanist is interested in the linguistic statistics of a text, but lacks the training to execute the digitization and processing of a text using code. The latter is one of the main problems that is ever present within the emerging field of digital humanities, the roadblock of technical knowledge needed to produce tools. We set out to build an extensible framework that would allow a humanities scholar with limited technical knowledge the ability to process, augment, and export digital versions of analog texts. To achieve this, we bring together multiple technologies including OCR, machine translation, and information visualization. By enumerating the set of spaces that can be used for these techniques and demonstrating their possibilities with examples, we hope to inspire users to add their own document augmentations to our existing framework.</p>

<p>The Textension framework starts with a document image, processes the image to discern both the content as well as the use of space on the page, adds space to the page as needed, and creates augmentations, both static and interactive, to insert into the newly digital object. The resulting processed image is presented to the user for further exploration, annotation, and interaction. The framework architecture is illustrated in <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="textension-prototype">Textension Prototype</h2>
<p>We provide a specific implementation of Textension in a web-based system which offers a selection of document augmentations and interactive tools, which we will describe in this section.</p>
<h2 id="image-capture-and-processing">Image Capture and Processing</h2>
<p>When a user comes to the opening screen of Textension they are presented with two input options. They can either use the camera that is built into their device (webcam, phone camera, front facing tablet camera) and take a snapshot of the document they wish to process, or they can upload an image file that has been previously prepared. Document images can be single or multiple pages and are uploaded with a drag and drop interface. The next stage of document processing begins immediately after the upload completes. The system uses image processing from the Python Image Library and image manipulation from OpenCV. We have found that a combination of binarization, grey-scaling, and image sharpening have had a noticeable effect on the results of the OCR, which is the next stage of processing.</p>
<h2 id="ocr-engine">OCR engine</h2>
<p>We used the open source Tesseract OCR engine in the Textension prototype. Smith provides an overview and a history of the development of the engine <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>, and Patel et al. provide a case study approach for its use <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. Tesseract can be trained with many different languages and also with handwriting, making it a robust choice for an implementation such as this.</p>
<p>While great effort is being taken by many companies to digitize the world’s books, this process is expensive, hardware dependent, and time-consuming. The Tesseract OCR engine provides high-quality open source OCR in a local setting for printed and hand-written text. Often when working between analog and digital platforms scholars are forced to type passages out, for example, to extract a quote from a book for insertion into a manuscript. This is due to the fact that many digital book readers do not give you access to text that can be copy and pasted for copyright reasons, or in some cases, only images of paper documents are provided. Our domain expert has been using Textension to quickly digitize small portions of text for inclusion into working documents. This application of Textension allows for easy transfer of quotable information from analog books to digital platforms using only the OCR functionality. In addition, the OCR engine provides the content in a machine-readable form for later linguistic processing, linking, and other augmentations. Tesseract also provides bounding boxes for each word, which we use to identify document spaces.</p>
<h2 id="background-synthesis">Background Synthesis</h2>
<p>In order to augment documents with helpful annotations, or to provide space for users to make pen-based annotations, document spaces often need to be enlarged. This is not possible when working with an analog document. However, in the digital version, we can manipulate the image to provide the needed space. For example, to place a translation of text between lines, the inter-line spacing first needs to be increased. Document backgrounds can be complicated, with changing lighting conditions almost guaranteed using mobile phone and tablet cameras. To retain the original look of the document image, we created a method for inserting space by synthesizing sections of the document background which seamlessly integrate with the original. These regions can be optionally clearly noted, for example by using a different color. This may be preferable in situations where differentiating the original document from manipulations is important, for example in archival and preservation work. Background pre-processing is a computationally intensive process, so an option for low or high-resolution processing is included. Low-resolution processing is suitable for quick interactive applications, where high-resolution processing is more suitable for printing and saving the results of an analysis session.</p>

</figure>
<p>To improve image capture quality, which can affect background synthesis, we provide the user with a frame to set their image in. While it is possible to adjust skew correction and automatically crop text from images, we found from our internal testing that forcing the user to frame the image themselves resulted in much better OCR and therefore a much better experience. There is precedence for this type of interaction in commercial settings such as remote cheque deposits for online banking, where a user is forced to frame and focus the cheque before the system will accept the image. Once we have the image we use the bounding boxes provided by the OCR engine to rebuild the document in image fragments within the web platform. Each space and word is modeled separately to allow us to manipulate those elements within the browser.</p>
<p>The important image regions for the space insertion algorithm are illustrated in <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>. To expand the space between the lines (expand  <strong>line space</strong> ) in high-resolution mode we first use Hough line detection to identify x-values where vertical lines exist on the page <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique to find instances of objects within a certain class of shapes (vertical lines in our application) by a voting procedure. This allows us to maintain the edges of pages and also to recreate lighting conditions near the bound edges as we expand space within the document.</p>
<p>The algorithm then copies a slice of the image from between each individual line from one edge of the page to the other. The height of the slice (the  <code>pixel cut height</code>  ) is set to the height of the unimpeded space between the bounding boxes of the lines of text above and below. For the low-resolution processing, copies of this slice are inserted vertically to create space in the document. Depending on the complexity of the background this process is sometimes adequate. However, in most cases, this results in image streaking, which is usable for testing and exploration, but can be distracting and is not sufficient for photo realistic background additions.</p>
<p>As local lighting and color effects are so prevalent in scanned and photographed documents, especially historical documents, we wanted to model the backgrounds from as local a position as possible. The intuition behind our approach is that we can randomly reorder pixels in a local region to reduce streaking while retaining local lighting. From the extracted slice of the document, we select a patch of the original image that has the dimensions of  <code>pixel cut height</code>  by  <code>pixel cut width</code> . To insert a new patch below it we simply randomize the pixels from the current patch and insert it. As we scan across the line we continue this in increments of  <code>pixel cut width</code>  until the line is complete. The one exception is when the patch location falls within a definable threshold of the x-values of the vertical lines found by the Hough line algorithm at the start of the process. In this case, the pixels in that patch are not randomized but rather copied, to retain the sharpness of the detected edge. This allows us to sample local lighting effects in the background of the image. For adding horizontal space between words a similar process is used. When space is added only between two words on a single line, we also add the same amount of space to all lines by distributing it across all inter-word spaces. This preserves the original justification of the document (see <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>).</p>
<p>The  <code>pixel cut height</code>  and  <code>pixel cut width</code>  parameters control the locality of the modeling. Reasonable defaults are provided, but they can be varied in the settings screen to obtain the best result.</p>
<p>We have also found that artifacts on the page disrupt the color balance within each individual cut and can affect the quality of the background rendering. We offer the option of removing artifacts on the input screen. To remove blemishes on the page, the cropped line is binarized, any pixels that turn black in the binarization process are not used within the color randomization that synthesizes the background color. This leaves the original artifact but does not propagate it during the space insertion process.</p>
<p>Background synthesis and artifact removal are pre-processed across all candidate regions of the document to a pre-set threshold of inserted space. The synthesized image data is stored for quick access and insertion during document augmentation and interaction.</p>

<h2 id="layout-engine">LAYOUT ENGINE</h2>
<p>After creating an interactive, expandable document from the captured image, augmentations can be added to provide supportive features as required for the specific task and context. For example, a learner may require word definitions, while a literary scholar may be interested in the contemporary use of the words in the document. Augmentations can take the form of inserted glyphs, images, overlays, and annotations in the document spaces, or they may replace or change the words in the document. Augmentations can be temporary or permanent, as appropriate for their purpose and the document space in which they appear. The insertion and placement of augmentations and the provision of interactivity on the document and its augmentations is provided by the layout engine (see <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>).</p>
<p>The images after upload are broken into individual word and space objects that are then recompiled in order onto an HTML canvas to reproduce the original image with the added flexibility of moving, inserting, and changing elements. Augmentations are placed on the canvas as a layer on top of the image objects. Textension has been developed to support the creation of new augmentations, which can draw on custom data processing, local datasets, or public APIs and data. Textension was built using flask, a python server back-end; bootstrap, for UI elements; jinja, a template engine for python; and jquery, for data handling.</p>
<h2 id="document-augmentations">DOCUMENT AUGMENTATIONS</h2>
<p>What we present in this section are a series of concrete implementations of document augmentations that demonstrate a subset of the possibilities of the Textension framework. The selected examples highlight the possible breadth available when considering the five document spaces and the possibilities for interaction with those spaces. We explore insertion augmentations, as well as temporary and permanent overlays. The availability of the plain text allows easy integration of natural language processing, and the fact that the digital document is built in pieces allows for easy insertion of space to accommodate for the adding of new features. In this way, we envision Textension as both a sandbox for designing interactive elements for digital documents and a way to use both digital and analog affordances simultaneously when working with texts.</p>

<h2 id="insertion-of-space">Insertion of Space</h2>
<p>To allow for interaction with books off the shelf we wanted to cross over between digital and analog affordances. The ability to write notes directly on the pages of a book is one of the analog affordances that is constantly used, much to the dismay of librarians throughout the world. As seen in studies by Marshall <sup id="fnref2:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> and Mehta <sup id="fnref5:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, there are workflows that depend on this type of interaction. Due to space constraints on the printed page, these annotations often take the form of writing in the margins of the text or squeezing into the spaces between the printed lines. For the digital version of the text, we wanted to enhance the ability to write on the page in both the  <strong>line space</strong>  and the  <strong>margin space</strong> . The pre-processed background is used to insert space within the text, to allow for writing notes or inserting elements such as maps.</p>
<p>There are two ways to insert space in Textension. The first is to simply tap and hold on a line with the stylus, or click with a mouse and that line will open up allowing space for writing. This works both vertically and horizontally; the trigger for vertical line creation is in the space between lines and for the horizontal space insertion it is in the space between words (see <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). The size of the space to be added is determined in the parameter settings for the tool. By default, we have set the opening increment at 20 pixels. Inserted space is both editable as a text box by clicking on it, or by toggling the draw mode space can be written in any way the user chooses (see <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>). The second method is to open all spaces of a given type (e.g. line spaces) through a menu function. Spaces can also be inserted by other augmentations which require space. For example, inserting space is a precursor to inserting translations between lines. Together, these methods allow for flexible interaction that can be used for editing and annotation.</p>
<h2 id="drawing-and-typing-on-the-document">Drawing and Typing on the Document</h2>
<p>Once space has been opened up we wanted to maintain the ability to type and write on the document. Both functions have a toggle and a color picker that allows for this type of interactivity. You can draw anywhere on the document, but typing has been constrained to text boxes that have been created in the new space of the document (see <a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>).</p>

<h2 id="ocr-confidence">OCR Confidence</h2>
<p>Often when digitizing analog texts OCR confidence is very important. Textension provides a feature where users can see an overlay of how uncertain the OCR algorithm was for each word. This augmentation is displayed as an overlay in the  <strong>word space</strong> . The darker the color the less confident the score. This mapping was designed to draw attention to and  “obscure”  those words that the system had difficulty recognizing. With the current trend in machine learning and the relative anxiety that is brought with black box algorithms, showing the inner workings of the OCR engine is a way to both help the user understand how the system is working but also where exactly work may need to be done to make for a better user experience and digital document (see <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>).</p>

<h2 id="ocr-text">OCR Text</h2>
<p>While the OCR confidence overlay can allow users to understand how well their scan has been processed, we added another feature that works in concert with the previous ones to place text within the  <strong>line space</strong> . The OCR text feature will spread all the lines in the document and insert the OCR text into editable text boxes (see <a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a>). The user can then correct the OCR directly on the newly built document and export the finished text into a text file. Our own project’s domain expert is already using this feature to solve the problem of not being able to cut and paste from digital books while writing Humanities essays. He has been taking pictures of quotations from physical copies of the books and exporting the OCR directly into a word processor.</p>
<h2 id="translation">Translation</h2>
<p>Once the user has tuned the OCR to their liking, they can toggle the auto-translate menu button which will then use the Google translate API and automatically insert a translation of the text in the  <strong>line space</strong>  (see <a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>). This method works for all of the languages currently supported by Google and its one limitation is typographical, in that books often split words on the end of lines. Future work will address this limitation.</p>

<h2 id="manual-removal-and-replacement-of-words">Manual Removal and Replacement of Words</h2>
<p>The manipulation of the  <strong>word space</strong>  on the level of the text is an option that could be used in many scenarios. This widget provides the ability to select an individual word, erase it from the document image, and substitute in a word provided by the user. New words are scaled to fit into the space of the existing word and are highlighted to show that they were additions. Possible scenarios for this type of inclusion could be manual translation, gender pronoun switching or switching between the Latin and common names of scientific organisms.</p>
<h2 id="location-based-maps">Location-Based Maps</h2>
<p>With named entity recognition, we demonstrate the power of digital affordances with photographed texts by inserting maps. During pre-processing, we detect and store place names within the text. When the map feature is toggled Textension highlights the place name in the document, and automatically inserts a map from the Google maps API directly into the document in the  <strong>margin space</strong> . This feature is a demonstration of the power of combining existing technology, such as the Google maps API with automatic document space expansion. Because the document is built in pieces we can freely move interactive elements into different document spaces to see which works best for the specific implementation.</p>
<h2 id="sparklines">Sparklines</h2>
<p><strong>Word space</strong>  visualizations have been showing promise as ways to augment digital texts <sup id="fnref4:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> Textension offers the ability to automatically insert these visualizations into images of analog texts.

This technique could be used for many different types of visualizations limited only by the power of the OCR and NLP techniques available.</p>

<h2 id="context-maps">Context Maps</h2>
<p>A context map lists all of the ways that a particular word or phrase has been used within a document. This digital affordance uses  <strong>canvas space</strong>  to build interactive concordance lines that highlight the four words before and after the word in question. The maps are built using the images patches of words in the document to maintain the document aesthetics and reduce the impact of OCR errors. This is an example of the types of things that can be done with ready access to linguistic information and expandable canvas space (see <a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>).</p>
<h2 id="lexical-uniqueness-glyphs">Lexical Uniqueness Glyphs</h2>
<p>The second  <strong>word space</strong>  visualization we implemented was showing the uniqueness of each word within the language (see <a href="#figure11">Figure 11</a>). When this mode is toggled active the user is given two time sliders, one for the upper and one for the lower bounds of the time in question and small bar charts are automatically inserted for each word in the document. Each chart is a relative representation of the word’s uniqueness within the given document, meaning that as the upper and lower bounds time sliders are adjusted, each glyph will adjust relative to the other. This type of interaction could be adjusted to address specific historical questions from literary scholars and could be extended to display anything that has data relating to the text. Possible scenarios for this include showing etymological information, usage information, or using color as a visual variable to display languages of origin.</p>
<h2 id="word-definitions">Word Definitions</h2>
<p>To demonstrate the possibilities of the  <strong>occlusion space</strong>  we have implemented a widget that allows the user to hover on a word within the newly digitized document and get dictionary information scraped from Webster’s Online Dictionary API <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. This space will often be used for impermanent information that the user will need once, such as a definition, and then can disappear (see <a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>).</p>

<h2 id="print-save-and-download">Print, Save, and Download</h2>
<p>As the features are toggled on and off within the tool, the user is given the option to save both editable text as an external text document but also high-resolution images of the current state within the program. The user has the option to export whatever document state that they create. Many features of Textension can be used at the same time so it is possible to create and export multiple variations of a single document.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The tension that exists between our analog pasts and our digital present can be addressed using our framework. Our prototype, Textension, leverages the power of OCR and digitally manipulates the five document spaces in near real-time. The system we present is an implementation of previous studies brought together in a way that can be extended easily for domain-specific analysis tasks. The web-based platform allows for easy integration with mobile technology and makes it possible to use Textension in a variety of locations and scenarios. We have demonstrated a breadth of possible use cases and have chosen widgets that demonstrate the utility of each of the document spaces.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Textension can be used in situations where quick digitization is necessary and digital versions may not be available, such as within the stacks of a university library. The web-based framework allows for easy document digitization using any web-enabled camera. This could be on a mobile phone or a desktop computer with a webcam. The system also allows for the uploading of previous digitized texts. The drag and drop interface allows for the uploading of PDF’s and digital images providing a robustness of input possibilities. The provided text augmentations support humanities activities such as annotation and close reading. By bringing in linked reference resources such as maps and lexical uniqueness scores, Textension can situate an unknown text in the greater spatial and linguistic context, assisting with tasks associated with    “distant reading”   <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  .</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>While we designed Textension to demonstrate the usefulness and power of bringing together affordances from paper and digital documents, there are still several ways that we can expand the system. The first is by using larger canvases. Textension focuses on space within documents and provides a limited extended canvas space. An infinite canvas workspace, such as the zoomable interface of PAD++ <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>, could allow for insertion of more than one document image in the same workspace, and the addition of larger and more sophisticated interactive visualizations.</p>
<p>The second addition that we envision is to apply these techniques in the opposite direction, namely to augment digital books with the same types of interactive elements. We have already seen some of these approaches within existing e-readers like Amazon’s Kindle, but there is a lot of room to experiment with that design space. Another welcome addition would be horizontal space organization to solve problems like line breaks when using the Google Translate API. Because the OCR uses lines as an organizing principle, hyphenated words often disrupt the OCR and the translation algorithm. Reconnecting hyphenated words would require reflowing the document to maintain a justified layout.</p>
<p>A final addition that would solve a problem in the digital humanities is to provide a way to easily create new augmentations for Textension so that users with limited programming abilities would be able to add features to the interface. The current implementation makes it easy to add new features with modest programming skills, but we would like to make that more accessible in the future.</p>

Welsh’s monograph  <em>Mixed Realism: Videogames and the Violence of Fiction</em>  comes at an appropriate time in American current events. In Welsh’s introduction, he tackles the question that continues to haunt new media scholars and literary scholars: does violence in media lead to real-life violence? After the recent Parkland, Fl. high school massacre, President Trump placed blame on violence in video games, a tactic that has been used since the Columbine tragedy to center fault around one piece of media, rather than looking at the individualized and networked contexts <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Welsh directly addresses this question in his introduction, arguing this logic centers around the immersion fallacy: video games and literature (the two types of media he explores) are simultaneously seen as immersive in that they remove us from the  “real,”  and influential in that they directly affect the  “real” . For Welsh, the problem with this fallacy is the real/virtual dichotomy it sets up; this dichotomy does not recognize the very real, material consequences of wired culture – and not necessarily in the manner Trump and others believe. In order to further explore this notion, Welsh coins the phrase  “mixed realism,”  a methodology that examines both the  “virtualities and the lived contexts in which we engage them”   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> by analyzing the affective and material experiences that result from consuming and participating in digital media.</p>
<p>Just like the media Welsh explores in his book,  <em>Mixed Realism</em>  is not a comfortable (in the affective sense) read, especially for an avid gamer and reader such as myself. The violence portrayed in media–particularly around guns and vengeance–permeates the video games and literature that Welsh examines. Welsh’s choices are not necessarily cherry-pickings, either, as a large percentage of commercially popular video games revolve around violence in some way. His methodology demands consumers of violent video games and literature to be accountable for how they choose to read and analyze media. In the introduction, Welsh frames his argument by examining the controversy around the game  <em>Super Columbine Massacre RPG!</em> , a game that was simultaneously critiqued for its inadequate representation of the massacre and its power to influence another school shooting that followed the game’s release. Welsh argues, though, that the importance of  <em>Super Columbine Massacre RPG!</em>  is not necessarily to represent the shooting in a  “realistic”  way, but rather make explicit  “one’s position as media user within a culture steeped in violence and in turn acknowledge responsibility…for the real-world violence that happened that day”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Although he is not arguing that violence in video games causes the horrors of a school shooting, he reframes the role consumers play in the reproduction of violent media and culture. His move reflects the mixed realism methodology by beginning to think about the role of virtual media in the material consequences and experiences that occur from users’ interaction with the virtuality.</p>
<p>Welsh spends the first major half of the book working through the history, theory, and methodology that has led him to develop this lens using  <em>In Cold Blood</em>  by Truman Capote and several self-reflexive video games. In the first chapter, he pours through different theorists’ interpretations of immersion and Hayles’ notion of embodiment – a new model of readership – to better demonstrate how the lens of immersion fails in Capote’s non-fiction, New Journalist novel that claims to show what  “ <em>actually happened</em> ”  in the murder of the Clutter family. Welsh argues that this novel simultaneously makes explicit the constructedness of the narrative while also asking the reader to interpret what  “actually happened,”  yet Capote presents the novel as the objective truth. While this argument is compelling in demonstrating the immersion fallacy and arguing the paradoxical nature of claiming a representation is what  “ <em>actually happened</em> ” , Welsh seems to use Capote’s novel to build up to the core of mixed realism – how does the explicit constructedness of a  “true”  representation tie into the  “virtualities and the lived contexts in which we engage them”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>?</p>
<p>Welsh begins to tackle this question in the next chapter titled  “Incomplete Worlds” , which centers around how the constructedness of narratives always leaves gaps. He uses  <em>Super Mario 64</em> ’s video mechanics as an example: the user can control both Mario and the camera watching Mario. By drawing out these paradoxes, the user is always aware of the constructedness of media narratives while also recognizing their role in following (or challenging) the rules of the game. Finally, The  “Gaming in Context”  and  “Metafiction”  chapters pull from the theoretical discussions Welsh brings into the piece in the former chapter in exploring several self-reflexive games that make explicit their constructedness. Exploring the gaps and constructed nature of narratives in media is a compelling argument, but I found myself again wanting more from these sections, especially  “Incomplete Worlds” . These chapters paid little attention to the real and urgent problem of wired culture and the representation of violence; Welsh even admits in one moment towards the end of the book that his argument was initially not concerned with violence, but one of his colleagues pointed out how central violence was in his argument. This first section seems to stand apart from the rest of the book because of this change.</p>
<p>The latter half of Welsh’s book is where his argument begins to shine. He implements his mixed realism lens to examine two pieces of media:  <em>House of Leaves</em>  by Mark Danielewski and the controversial videogame  <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> . Welsh addresses the problematics of violence and gaps in narratives by showing how those media make explicit these problematics. For  <em>House of Leaves</em> , Welsh focuses on the section  “describing”   <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  Jed’s death. In this section, the form of the book follows its content, or as Welsh argues, the  “real-world  “happening”  of reading the book belongs to the novel’s fiction”   <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Similarly in the previous chapters’ focus on the explicit constructedness of narratives, Welsh looks at Danielewski’s choices in literal gaps on the page as representative of the gaps in narratives. Although this argument is based off Welsh’s previous chapters, chapter six gets at the core problem of the narrative gap as both a form of violence and a failure to represent violence;  “analysis, discussion of the event, and even descriptions on the page are always inadequate, always tangential, and always too late”   <sup id="fnref4:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. By acknowledging these failures and gaps, we can better understand our own individual, social, and contextual positions as we consume texts as well as take responsibility for our interpretations of the narratives.</p>
<p>The most powerful chapter in Welsh’s book revolves around the controversial No Russian level in  <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> ’s ( <em>CoD:MW2</em> ) campaign. I want to emphasize the importance of chapter seven as it provides a model for not only how to explore a text through the mixed realism lens, but also for how to handle sensitive and traumatic topics such as war-at-a-distance and drone warfare. In the  <em>CoD:MW2</em>  level, a player participates in a terrorist attack at an airport and makes the choice to either kill or stand by and watch others kill innocent civilians. Instead of diving right into this level, he looks at the context of the rest of the game, examining how the different events in the game mirror the very real and urgent war-at-a-distance. Such war is fought in the digital realm and values faceless enemies until there is need to justify the violence, as Welsh explains in his analysis of the face-to-face combat portion of the campaign. For Welsh, the ways in which  <em>CoD:MW2</em>  mirror and replicate drone warfare, or bombing of an area from a distance, are more frightening than the controversial No Russian level. In fact, Welsh argues the No Russian level is when users may feel empathy and disgust as they watch the horrors of warfare on innocent civilians (or pixilated representations of innocent civilians) unfold; meanwhile, the drone warfare prevents players from engaging and empathizing with victims as the user bombs pixelated shadows. What Welsh begins to explore here is one of the most powerful moments in his piece: how do users ascribe value to the millions of pixels, the algorithmic responses, the rules of a game, and the narrative gaps that are presented?</p>
<p>In his conclusion, Welsh has a paragraph that mentions GamerGate, the Arab Spring, NSA surveillance, and other current events in which mixed realism might be applied <sup id="fnref5:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The sandwiching of these event mentions in the conclusion with the Columbine and other tragedies feels rushed, but by doing so, Welsh offers his readers a chance to pick up where he leaves off. I do believe Welsh’s lens can extend across media and ponder more deeply the portrayal of  “real violences, both local and global”  in media. He ends his book by bringing in seemingly amoral media: Cormac McCarthy’s  <em>Blood Meridian</em>  and  <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> . For those two pieces of text, he argues that there is little in the presentation of violence to provide an ethical and moral guide for users; however, what Welsh finds valuable are the  “unguessed kinships”   <sup id="fnref6:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that users form with characters, thus ending the book in a surprisingly optimistic manner. I cannot help but wonder, though, kinships for whom?</p>
<p>Welsh’s methodology is important for exploring affect and the very real dangers and violence that can result from wired culture. Because he spends so much time framing his mixed realism lens in the first section, though, many of his choices in media and topic left me wanting more. Welsh addresses this in his introduction when he says  “mixed reality circulates a little differently in each and every configuration, sometimes turning on a unique interaction or specific media affordance…reading mixed realism is a process of careful tracing, following sometimes a singular aspect of the virtual as it reframes entirely our engagement with it by situating us within the broader media ecology”   <sup id="fnref7:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. In our broader media ecology of digital humanities and new media studies, though, there is already acknowledgement of the very real and tangible influences of wired culture; new media scholars–such as N. Katherine Hayles and Elizabeth Losh <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>–have already been thinking about how we place value on the billions of pixels we consume every day. What Welsh’s methodology offers is an extension of this, but he does not take advantage of some necessary critical lenses: embodiment and feminist gaming studies. While Welsh is able to be critical of the gaps in textual narratives, there is a lack of attention to race, gender, and socioeconomic class; those who are most heavily affected–and often erased–by these narrative gaps are people in marginalized groups. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>When thinking about violence in gaming, first person shooters are an obvious place to look. Patriarchal ideologies of violence and individualism are often embedded in violent texts and video games–like  <em>Call of Duty</em> ,  <em>Halo</em> ,  <em>Fortnite</em> , and several texts mentioned by Welsh. I also would have liked to see him dive further into the ways in which games, both the violent content and the ways in which these games are taken up, encourage toxic behaviors, especially for young men and further explore how these toxic behaviors may stifle empathy and compassion. He also mentions GamerGate and Anita Sarkeesian in passing, but does not take time to emphasize the violence of online harassment, not just for feminist gaming critics like Sarkeesian, but for gamers whose voices suggest they are not white cis-men (for those gamers brave enough to venture onto their mic) or even gamers whose usernames may be read as feminine. I would have liked to see him do more work focusing on games&rsquo; violent representations of and online harassment towards women (especially women of color), queer people, and other marginalized gamers and consumers. How might the mixed realism lens shift when looking at violence towards pixelated characters who represent very real people who have historically and currently had very real systematic violence enacted upon them?</p>
<p>As Welsh points out, games are narratives woven through a series of rules and algorithmic response, but in commercially popular video games, these narratives are typically violent in nature. When talking about gaming, it is difficult to avoid conversations of violence. As gamers, readers, and new media scholars, how do we wrestle with the idea that the medium we care about is often violent? How do we continue to prioritize games’ politics, as Ruberg and Phillips call for in the introduction to the  <em>Game Studies</em>  special issue on  “Queerness and Video Games” <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>? Merging feminist gaming scholarship and Welsh’s mixed realism centers the material experiences and consequences of wired culture as well as the ways in which we as users, consumers, and critics are responsible for how we engage with and analyze media.</p>
<p>I use the scare quotes around describing here because there is actually very little description of Jed’s death.</p>
<p>I do want to acknowledge that Welsh uses the she pronoun when talking about gamers, a move that seems to be a response to GamerGate and the policing of women, especially women of color, in gaming.</p>
