<p>FemTechNet is a shifting constellation of academics and community members concerned with the implications that feminism and technology hold in relation to one another. Generated through conversations in 2012, the collective gained ground and recognition for the creation of Distributed Open Collaborative Courses (DOCC)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#juhasz2012"> [juhasz2012] </a>. These courses created moments of <em>unbalance</em> within pedagogy as a theory and practice through the inclusion of feminist, distributed, non-hierarchical power structures that challenge knowing and teaching through technology with a decidedly feminist lens.</p>
<p>The distribution of knowledge and the disruption of power have been central to the feminist collective since its inception<a class="footnote-ref" href="#femtechnet2014"> [femtechnet2014] </a>. The FemTechNet <em>Manifesto</em> conveys an understanding of feminism as a feature of individual actors in the network (feminists) and as a set of actions (including accountaibility, collaboration, and care). From its early iterations, the collective “imagined feminism and technology very broadly” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#losh2016"> [losh2016] </a>. By its own proclamation, the network is “part of and bigger than the contemporary university” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#femtechnet2014"> [femtechnet2014] </a>. I became affiliated with (though not a member of) this network in 2017, when I was brought in to created descriptions for materials held in the FemTechNet digital archive under the possibility that it would be placed in an academic, insitutional home.</p>
<p>As in the larger terrain of digital humanities, feminism takes form as a notable absence within academic archives or appears most often as an intervention in that absence<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wernimont2015"> [wernimont2015] </a>. Institutionalization is counter to feminist values as it often contributes to the continued erasure of women, people of color, queers, and others whose precarity is traced through the absence of records (<a class="footnote-ref" href="#balsamo2013"> [balsamo2013] </a>in a video dialogue for the DOCC). Simultaneously, institutionalization shapes the archives of projects that lie outside of but are frequently dependent on academic frameworks. The archive discussed herein is not the broad, collected archive often found in digital humanities. Rather, it is the “repository for the historical records of its parent organization” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#theimer2012"> [theimer2012] </a>. The nature of FemTechNet — a distributed collective with members who usually are connected to various academic institutions — disturbs the idea of a “parent” organization through attempts to disrupt hierarchies of belonging. Despite this, FemTechNet’s reliance on institutions is best revealed through its archive in ephemeral objects.</p>
<p>Receipts, schedules, and dropped grant applications combine to show that FemTechNet activities were often shaped by access to resources and powerful institutions. This research strums the tension of placing the records of a collective that was originally organized against the grain of hegemonic processes in academia and specifically within studies of technology into a digital archive to be maintained by an academic institution.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The constraints placed by an academic institutional archive cause a feminist project to lose affective salience. Emotion, friendship, and dissonance exist only as implications in the static archive rather than as central mechanisms of organizational continuity. Affective loss is not only a feature of documentation, it may be a deliberate maneuver to reduce possible risk to members. Risk is held in tension with the consequence of not placing the archive in a resource-rich institution where it will be hosted and maintained. Without the institutional archive, the records of the self-proclaimed anti-racist, feminist project of FemTechNet is lost or left to be reinvented by future collectives. Within the institutional archive, issues of distributed collaboration, authorship, and access become paramount. This article reintroduces affect into the FemTechNet archive through a rooted exploration of the functions of affect in the network. It removes the salience of individual instances of emotional resonance in recognition of archival risks while simultaneously holding the archive of FemTechNet documents to the shared forms of the network.</p>
<p>Cifor and Wood (2017) have sketched the history of feminist archives as a resistance and an act of telling what has been obscured by power. Where once feminist archives predominantly lingered at the edges of the mainstream, in houses or community archives, they are now increasingly placed within institutions<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cifor2017"> [cifor2017] </a>. Advocating for feminist engagements with archival theory, Cifor and Wood state that “addressing hierarchical structures and bureaucratic models of organization explicitly has remained relatively under-theorized. The investment in hierarchy cannot simply be understood as an adherence to rationality, it is a means of creating social relations” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cifor2017"> [cifor2017] </a>. In the case of FemTechNet, planning the institutional inclusion of the records of a feminist collective that challenges notions of hierarchy into a bureaucratic system of archives — however dispersed — caused me to intensely reflect on how the access afforded by material resources might be held against the central organizing principles of FemTechNet. What follows is a feminist engagement with the hard edges and sharp drops found through the now-dormant effort to maintain a digital record outside of the collective where it was formed.</p>
<p>Through my own reflections and interviews with FemTechNet members, I attempt to determine if it is possible to align the institutionally held digital archive with the principles and goals of FemTechNet and to illustrate the feminist potential that exists even in a navigation of institutions. Archives may be framed through their creators and curators by walking along particular feminist trajectories that are concerned with meaning, affect, loss and (the failures and successes of) intention<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hedstrom2002"> [hedstrom2002] </a>. Archivists and users of the archive should “place not only the records they deal with in context — but also &hellip; place archivists, archival practice, and archival institutions in an equally dynamic context” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hedstrom2002"> [hedstrom2002] </a>and “such traces of self-conscious archival activities would provide a lens through which the users could read and interpret the evidence left behind” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hedstrom2002"> [hedstrom2002] </a>. Following Hedstrom, this document will serve to change the meaning and possible interpretations of the academic institutional archive of FemTechNet records. It inserts affect into the archive at a distance, reiterating the role of affect in non-hierarchical feminist organizing as a process — but at a remove that intends to lessen the danger of revelation. Ultimately, it challenges a narrative of archival invisibility as loss or absence and archival visibility as straightforward evidence or easily discernable fact.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>The following research occurred in two parts. The first section, “Shaping the Archive,” contains my personal reflections on the process of creating descriptive data for four years of FemTechNet records that were originally included in a collectively maintained Google drive. Using the lens of FemTechNet’s values as outlined in their <em>Manifesto</em> , I reflect on themes raised through my engagement with FemTechNet records. The second section, “Approaching the Archive” , includes analysis of open-ended interviews with fourteen FemTechNet collective members who self-selected to be interviewed.</p>
<p>The interview process was explicitly feminist and informed by feminist ethnography<a class="footnote-ref" href="#davis2011"> [davis2011] </a>, as was the analysis of interview content, which occurred through Charmaz’<a class="footnote-ref" href="#charmaz2006"> [charmaz2006] </a>contextualized grounded theory approach, which follows from Glaser and Strauss<a class="footnote-ref" href="#glaser1967"> [glaser1967] </a>. Charmaz’ model integrates the understandings of power in shaping possibilities for disclosure and other acts<a class="footnote-ref" href="#charmaz2006"> [charmaz2006] </a>. Power and contexts were incorporated into the research through questions that directly addressed interviewees’ views on institutions and institutionalization of the archive. Analysis of the interviews provides a greater understanding of the roles of institutions in the archive and overall functioning of the collective, how affect informed the network, and collective members’ own perceptions of what can or ought to be made visible (and, conversely, kept invisible) in the archive.</p>

<h2 id="durable-forms">Durable forms</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“I suppose because I love you, I want to hold onto you in some durable form like an archive.” - Irish, in an exploration of how and in what ways a digital archive may continue the intents of the FemTechNet collective.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#irish2016"> [irish2016] </a><br>
As is the case with traditional archives, the creation of descriptive data for FemTechNet materials involved engagement with minutiae. In the early process of determining what held value, I found myself lingering in the descriptive acts of differences between receipts and of contracts negotiated and then withdrawn or modified. FemTechNet’s ephemera spoke to meeting institutional requirements for legitimacy through adherence to demands and policies. The records of the collective illustrate its position as an extension of the universities where its operations occurred. The evidence of the labor involved in meeting institutional demands amplified as the collective’s records and resources — its “homes” — moved from institution to institution. The records reflected the varying requirements of one university against another, illustrating the differences among institutions and their expectations for “legitimate” undertakings. Through a feminist lens, these records revealed the requirements of various academic institutions and the hidden labor entailed in meeting those requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The procession of mundane and hidden acts affirms how little trust exists between institutions and those who endure them as an aspect of loving the subversive or fledgling project or possibility. Receipts or dropped communications or unfinished grant applications are evidence of the difficulty created by institutions, even as FemTechNet was overseen by a group of widely recognized and respected intellectuals within and outside of academia. Records that exist as a response to institutional demands are reminders of affiliation as a process of seeking — validation, funding, legitimacy, recognition. They highlight the ongoing role of a neoliberal university to produce workers who continue the status quo of late capitalism, and its position as accountable to (the idea of) a public that does not view knowledge, in and of itself, as a productive activity.</p>
<p>An archive allows, potentially, for its users to learn and unveil the relationship between collective members and to trace the spaces of care and solace that form in the midst of a university. Emphasizing the affective and affectively feminist dimensions within the archive of FemTechNet acts as a criticism of the neoliberal ideologies that shape academic institutions<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cifor2016"> [cifor2016] </a>. Building from Cvetokvich’s archive of feelings, Cifor posits that the inclusion of affect “is necessary in order to trouble dominant power relations and adequately reflect the lives and meet the needs of the diverse communities that archivists document and serve” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cifor2016"> [cifor2016] </a>. FemTechNet records provide evidence of the demand for academic products and of the repeated steps to meet the demands of the affiliate or granting body. The affect hidden here is a dragging, a tedium, an attention to detail that is forever shaped by the ways power and material access create and abruptly curtail the possibility of critical pursuits.</p>
<p>The dynamic archives envisioned by Irish<a class="footnote-ref" href="#irish2016"> [irish2016] </a>contrasted heavily with the materials for which I created descriptive information. While I did not often consider how the archive of FemTechNet born-digital documents might sit in relation to other collections within its academic institutional home, the idea of the univeristy as a “home” subtly changed the shape of my description<a class="footnote-ref" href="#eichhorn2014"> [eichhorn2014] </a>. My own assumptions of “archival proximity” — between contrasting collections, between individual objects within the FemTechNet collection — influenced my descriptions<a class="footnote-ref" href="#eichhorn2014"> [eichhorn2014] </a>. Despite a drift to appear objective and professional, the records’ descriptions contain potent but latent affective aspects. There is a possibility that, in cleaning up the archive — erasing duplicates or near duplicates, organizing the messiness of fervor and desire (and limited resources) — the affective links become obscured or broken.</p>
<h2 id="obscured-affect">Obscured affect</h2>
<p>In other instances, the loss of affect is challenged through the experiences and recordings of those who lived, saw, enacted, understood, cried about, were hurt by, or otherwise felt the actual impact of events. This is what the archive seems to continually lose and loose — and any researcher who wishes to explore the affective dimensions of FemTechNet, a decidedly feminist project, may find that affect is only inferred by changes of direction, by the frequency of co-publishing, or the (possibly) inaccurate measure of a facial expression or tone of voice. These exist, for the most part, in the imaginary of the collective’s archive.</p>
<p>The imagined permeates archival existence<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gilliland2016"> [gilliland2016] </a>. The desire for affect and evidence is a carrying forth of a particular feminist tradition of engaging silences. Part of the feminist archival project is to “envision new ways that archival description, retrieval, and use can be reworked to take absences — and their attending affects — into account” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gilliland2016"> [gilliland2016] </a>. This project may also entail an uncovering of where affect acts as absence — either through the creation of descriptive information, the privileging of particular topics, or through the individual or collective omission of affective experiences. In short, the archive matters, but the archive, and its creators, could always be lying, withholding, hiding something.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to lie, to withhold, to hold multiple locations at once, only allowing some of them to come into focus. Research on trans- feminist and queer (both “LGBTQ” and strange) archives has engaged with the functions of intentional silences<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cowan2018"> [cowan2018] </a>. Shotwell, in a discussion of women’s positions formed by the early definitions of AIDS, explains that feelings of failed memory and of omission may have occurred because they are “experiences as a past from the point of view of an unexpected future” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#shotwell2016"> [shotwell2016] </a>. The archive may undo the linear aspects of time in its holding of recollection and materials that were actively erased through institutional acts.</p>
<p>Archivists, the keepers of information, are responsible for futures in which information is more available or absences are more descriptively defined. Lee outlines this in relation to Berlant’s conceptions of what belongs or becomes acceptable as a discourse of nationalism alongside Gordon’s ideas of ghostly encounters<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lee2017"> [lee2017] </a>. Here, the silence, the absence, is a haunting. Haunting, memory, and rupture are situated in the spaces between and relationships within the archival collection. For users of the FemTechNet archive, encounters informed by knowledge of the organizing principles of the collective may introduce affect as a haunting absence.</p>
<p>The digital plays a particular role in revealing the loss of affective presence. In digital environments that are often structured through claims to masculinity or calls for competition, a feminist, collective presence challenges the culture. Due to such powerful structures, the feminist archive is an act against historical silences and monolithic narratives. Without adhering to techno-utopian approaches to the digital and with caution toward the method of conveyance as related to the medium of original content<a class="footnote-ref" href="#eichhorn2014"> [eichhorn2014] </a>, it is still possible to explore how the digital potentially disrupts silence. By no means available to all, the digital archive may still create new possibilities through intention or serendipity. Withers, while deeply critical of the intentions that sit behind the construction of for-profit archives and short-lived digital projects, explains that “[d]igital metadata can place feminist histories within networks of reference and association that may help to assuage the ephemeral conditions of feminist histories that are often subject to dramatic cycles of recovery and loss” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#withers2017"> [withers2017] </a>. Placing a discussion of the FemTechNet archive alongside projects such as the Women’s Liberation Music Archive described by Withers and the Chicana por mi Raza archive described by Cotera becomes a way of addressing silences, of positioning projects within a frame of reference and an imagined network<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cotera2015"> [cotera2015] </a>.</p>
<p>Not all silences and losses are affectively negative. Femerality, for instance, was one of the formative aspects of the FemTechNet collective. FemTechNet members acknowledged the possibility of their own ephemeral engagement with the collective alongside the potential that materials and events would not necessarily have permanence. For FemTechNet the concept of femerality worked toward an honesty and trust that countered the material record of FemTechNet&rsquo;s interaction with many (but not all) institutional affiliations and records, but did not always reveal how shifts in the collective’s perspective occurred over time. As with other documents of collective projects, “[e]ssential pieces of information, which might answer questions and direct research, are not necessarily tangible or archived” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ault2013"> [ault2013] </a>.</p>
<p>Digital archival collections can but do not inherently push against the silence and absence that feminists so often seek to highlight. Cotera explores the possibilities of the archive as holding the “discursive power” of history and existence<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cotera2015"> [cotera2015] </a>. The discursive power of the institutional archive can hold multiple meanings. In one, reading the silence and the absence within the archive becomes a tool to work against the historical narrative of hegemonic power. In another, “subaltern knowledges are recovered only to be recirculated as scholarly products that reify the academy’s authoritative status as a site of knowledge production” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cotera2015"> [cotera2015] </a>. In yet another, feminist <em>archivista</em> positions reshape the archive into something collaborative, collective, and generative<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cotera2015"> [cotera2015] </a>. Here, the “common becomes a new terrain” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cotera2015"> [cotera2015] </a>. It is possible that the documentation of collectivity, however unrecorded in its discord and adherence, pushes against individualistic approaches to the institutional archive. The unrecorded then, might act as contrast.</p>
<h2 id="risking-permanence">Risking permanence</h2>
<p>In a discussion of lesbian oral histories, Chenier implicates the archivist as responsible for the the ethical balance between the personal — a history — and the political — a collective meaning achieved through access to these histories<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chenier2015"> [chenier2015] </a>. At sway here are the issues of confidentiality and consent. In a world where the terrain of acceptance or (at minimum) tolerance continues to shift and entail forms of intense retribution (what Chenier describes as “privacy anxieties” )<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chenier2015"> [chenier2015] </a>, archivists must respect LGBTQ individuals who dare not be outed by the archive. It is not a far stretch, in this moment, to imagine that the same shifts can, and do, occur across affiliations with feminist projects that seek to undo institutionally maintained systemic forces of racism, sexism, and homophobia while also being located in the middle and interstices of these institutions.</p>
<p>Add to this the knowledge that those with power (be they individuals with class or race privilege or hiring institutions involved in vetting processes) have utilized the digital record against those without power at increasingly alarming rates. The availability of data that can be used to identify members of FemTechNet, even if it is only an associational belonging, can be enough for those who want to invalidate or threaten the work of feminist and anti-racist groups. The methods of data discovery, collection, and dissemination among antagonists has been complex and may mean that silence, while a burden, can also become a refuge from attack — that engaging in feminist or other political projects outside of mainstream recognition and without leaving a trace is a way of seeking protection.</p>
<p>Alternately, the archive offers up the possibility of recognition and encouragement. In utopian formulations, the archive serves as a point of recognition and resonance and the archive can be activated in such a way that “in looking back, activists might see innovative ways of intervening in the(ir) present” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#buchanan2015"> [buchanan2015] </a>. There is, in the archive, a desire to be “recounted” as well as “open-ended” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ault2013"> [ault2013] </a>. The archive of FemTechNet records and activities may provide a historical grounding for future feminist projects that broadly grapple with and utilize technologies. Beyond speaking to the possibility of the existence of distributed feminist collectives, the archive may provide background information that allows the next iteration of similar projects to grow from the knowledge developed by FemTechNet.</p>
<p>My own reflections on shaping the archive and its descriptive data are evident in the process of conducting open-ended interviews with members of the FemTechNet collective. While I did not highlight the anxieties I felt or tensions I identified previous to the interview process, I did attend to the topics addressed in this section when collective members brought them to the fore. As the concerns identified herein are relevant to the construction of feminist archival projects, there were often areas of overlap between topics raised by interviewees and those present in the above contemplations.</p>
<h2 id="approaching-the-archive">Approaching the Archive</h2>
<p>Collective members discussed the possible institutional archive through references to their own positions to the archive (as creators of documents or envisioning themselves as users) and the ways they conceptualized its form. They shared their knowledge of the levels of documentation undertaken by the collective, the infrastructure required for maintaining (existing or possible forms of) documentation, and their hopes and trepidations around the risks and possibilities created by the archive. In thinking through the perilousness of the archive, interviewees imagined the archive in various manifestations, mediating access with recognition of institutional norms around open, closed, or modified points of entry.</p>
<p>FemTechNet members noted that the nature of the collective — distributed, loose, dispersed — necessitated huge amounts of documentation. Documentation was produced through collaborative work, out of institutional requirements and an urge to archive “kind of compulsively.” In considering the extent of documentation produced within FemTechNet, interviewees emphasized the resources provided by an institutional archive as surpassing what collective members, who voluntarily contributed labor to the project, could provide. Members variously mentioned the need for maintenance of digital materials, for their cataloging, tagging, and grouping, and expressed desire for an archive that extended “beyond the memory of members.” The institutional digital archive was appealing due to the “paltry possibilities in a neoliberal university” — it was the “lesser evil.” This held true even as collective members placed their trust in Irish as a decision-maker around the archive, and as they acknowledged the professional nature of archive employees (one interviewee, in particular, noted being “at some kind of peace and security that boisterous, sometimes out of control representation of the many, many things we did are being handled by professionals” ).</p>
<p>FemTechNet members described the differences in archives and institutional ideologies as they compared an institutional university archive to other forms of preservation. The “culture and power dynamics” of individual institutions were seen as shaping how much control FemTechNet might retain over the institutional archive as well as where and how FemTechNet materials might be located and described. Interviewees particularly noted the loss of power and control that might happen once records fell under institutional purview. In this line of thought, one interviewee noted the benefit an institution might receive for being known as a host of the FemTechNet, asking “how is it possible to create an actual relationship with the institutions?”</p>
<p>In imagining the institutional digital archive of FemTechNet materials, collective members differed in their line of pragmatism. One member expressed desire for a “living archive, dynamic archive.” Others noted that this archive might be shaped by how it is used and known through the trails and vestiges of users, possibly restructured through its use in the creation and shift of “folders, hierarchies” and tagging. Another noted that capturing the processes of women’s work is part of “keeping a lineage of feminist work in the academy and in technology specifically,” highlighting the erasure of women in archival spaces. Others made comparisons against less appealing possible forms of the archive. In one instance, the present distributed shape of FemTechNet records (many of which are held at the individual institutions that formerly acted as “home” for the collective’s records) was a driving force in desiring an amalgamated institutional archive. In another, institutional digital archives were compared to less desirable corporate, for-profit ventures, such as YouTube. From this vantage point, the institutional archive held an appeal beyond resources and structure.</p>
<p>The complexity of technologies used for meetings and collaborative projects influenced how and in what shape materials were made to be included in the archive. The level of caution described by interviewees around archiving particular modes of communication (such as the Bluejeans video conferencing platform) must be understood in relation to the level of intimacy these technologies facilitated among collective members. Bluejeans, a collaborative tool that utilizes video, voice, and chat, was repeatedly mentioned in reference not only to impossible infrastructural demands (if kept as records, the size of these files would surpass the capacity of FemTechNet to retain the meetings as recordings) but also as facilitating togetherness and forms of personal exchange that were intentionally kept out of any possible, even internal, archive.</p>
<p>Interviewees differed on their conceptualizations of the archive. These differences were often based in their positions on the need for caution and for access. For some, it was “incredibly important to archive the work” in light of “the scariness of things disappearing.” For others, the stability of the digital form had to be held in tension with the ephemeral conditions (such as a Bluejeans meeting) that were part of FemTechNet’s becoming. Others considered the possibilities for harm given various forms the archive might take — limiting access versus a more complete archive ( “if we wanted a complete archive&hellip;. that kind of thing I wouldn’t want anyone to see for – 50 years!” ). Interviewee’s conceptualizations also involved accounting for ownership — asking whether or not materials collectively (and at times, anonymously) created belonged to their individual creators or to the collective in its present iteration. This was especially sticky considering that “almost everything” was “collaborative or anonymous — DELIBERATELY decentering the individual.”</p>
<p>Creation, control, and the public face of FemTechNet brought to light issues of trace and provenance, which compounded the privately shared forms of affective belonging that members valued within the collective. Member’s concerns informed how records were produced and made available within the collective as a whole, as well as what materials were intentionally absent in the archive. Records of affect were at times viewed by interviewees as a liability, a necessary absence in the records. As one member stated, “commitments to feminist structure eliminate the inclusion of affect in documents.” Due to the requirements of professionalism and in recognition of the negative interpretations of affect as indicative of professional failure, records were often intentionally void of emotional cadence or were not placed into the collective records of FemTechNet. Even when kept, the records could be “very partial, very weird &hellip; reconstructed from the missing pieces for people who were there” but not for outsiders. Others approached the tension of control and creation with a perspective of collective well-being and continuation, pointing to the ongoing processes in which FemTechNet is involved, including grant writing. For these individuals, the time of creation of the archive existed as a question of ethics – it was “hasty” to hold materials in the archive while members were still in the process of the work.</p>
<p>Not all members discussed a proactive creation of archival absence of their personal lives or feelings. However, it was in mentioning these traces that interviewees were most likely to raise concerns of privacy and personal safety and to imagine multiple approaches to the use of the institutional digital archive of FemTechNet materials. Individual precarity in relation to institutions (adjunct or pre-tenure teaching) was a condition that pre-determined what fell out of the existing archive. For example, due to their individual nature, the mentorship of tenured faculty and letters of support did not exist in the archive of the collective. Precariousness in institutions was not always directly related to position, it also was influenced by whether or not individuals encountered sympathetic colleagues or departmental support at their individual institutions. Closing the archive was viewed as a protective move in light of that precarity.</p>
<p>Some interviewees noted that documents maintained by FemTechNet were at times generated without any intention of archiving ( “we haven’t been taking notes and writing in these personal, decoupled ways” ). The dangerousness of these records being made public was due to the institutionally maintained division of professionalism and affect. Affective absence was at times viewed as necessity, with faith that individuals who encountered the archive (given possible constraints on access) would know that “quiet isn&rsquo;t silence, things that you don’t see doesn’t mean it is not happening — we know things that don’t go in public records&hellip; and that’s okay” .</p>
<p>Ethical concerns, especially those around safety, informed the various manifestations of access and engagement that FemTechNet members envisioned in the archive. Risk was almost always held in tension with the “need to be preserved” and the possibility of creating a lineage that could inspire and inform other, possibly similar, feminist collectives. Others expressed hope for an open review period (within the network) of all items that might eventually be placed in the institutional archive. A range of restrictive procedures were envisioned during the interviews, from closing the archives for a number of years to placing requirements on any researchers to go through ethnographic training in light of the collective nature of the archive. In this iteration, the researcher would be required by the institution to acknowledge provenance and gain permission from creators of any given material. Even if these restrictions and guarantees were in place, there was acknowledgement among the members that there would be issues of digital security inherent in the archive. Placing the archive in an academic institution could lead to loopholes in restricted access through FOIA requests and other such mechanism that would lead to a lack of control over the information contained therein.</p>
<p>To this end, interviewees tended to present three possible forms of use of the archive. In the first, there was the possibility of an institutional archive that was primarily utilized by and maintained for FemTechNet members. In this form, the distributed materials produced by FemTechNet were co-located and easy to access. Interviewees often recounted their own difficulties with finding past information or being barred by institutional walls (in instances where an institution had held FemTechNet materials but the collective member had moved away from the institution). For members who took this approach, the archive was envisioned as an aspect of the ongoing work of FemTechNet.</p>
<p>In the second imagined form, the archive was externally accessible. Interviewees who discussed external access mentioned the possibilities of other projects, expressing a desire for the archive to contain “the material that moves forward other initiatives.” Others noted that an externally accessible archive entails a broad range of users. An externally accessible archive might create access “into perpetuity” for people “who aren’t necessarily sensitive to the goals of FemTechNet.” A few interviewees felt a high degree of discomfort and anxiety when imagining this type of accessible archive.</p>
<p>In the third form, collective members openly acknowledged the heightened risk of having an institutionalized archive — that beyond the possibility of the research being used incorrectly, information in the archive, including affectively revelatory information, could be put to nefarious use. This line of thought was situated in FemTechNet’s own history — one that had been formed during intense manifestations of “toxic digital misogyny” and racism. Fears of being targeted by hate groups, far right zealots, and others with cruel intentions created wariness around the overall project of the archive. Interviewees’ fears related to the mediated professional public faces that institutional placements required of FemTechNet members.</p>
<h2 id="institutional-sway">Institutional sway</h2>
<p>FemTechNet was and is still shaped by institutional forces. It was established to create publicly untraceable links, specifically through a redistribution ( “pool” ing) of the power held by respected academic feminists through mentorship, networks of support letters to institutions for job placements, and material resources. In thinking of institutional sways over the shape of the collective (sways that are often passingly present in the documents in the archive), interviewees discussed the importance of leveraging resources and maintaining a collective formation that, while dispersed, continued to be composed of and encouraged prestigious feminist technological engagement. Resources defined the possibilities available to the collective not only in relation to grant seeking (and the “structural challenges” caused because many granting bodies “explicitly forbid political advocacy” ) but also general funding.</p>
<p>Interviewees indicated the fraught nature of creating feminist work through the resources of the institution. They made active decisions not to “play by the rules” in their implementation of feminist practices that often ran a hard counter to institutional logics. Given the feminist disruption of the university as a goal, they also noted specific points where institutions benefitted from the incorporation of FemTechNet courses or materials, which were often brought into being through massive amounts of hidden labor. Much of the evidence of FemTechNet, its public face, depended on energetic devotions often unseen, unacknowledged, and even derided within institutions; these “devotions” were performed as a “third or fourth job” or unwaged labor. Alongside generating cultural standing for institutions through concealed work, members in institutional placements were also subject to the schedules and bureaucratic buttresses of institutional requirements. Interviewees were forced to work outside of an affective, reactive, and feminist time frame and instead function in the slow pull of academic rationality.</p>
<p>When prompted, interviewees noted the intense institutional requirements that called for the minutiae I described in preparing the archive for institutionalization as part of the work of redistributing resources throughout FemTechNet (one stated that minutiae is “very live” in the process of the work). Others noted proactive documentation as a survival strategy, an acknowledgement that FemTechNet, as a collective, flows in, out, and around institutional requirements. Individual institutional affiliations shaped how information was created and maintained, and often information was lost when individuals changed positions. The work of creating and maintaining documentation was also discussed in relation to precarity, specifically that of adjunct and untenured members of the collective. Redistributing power entailed redistributing the more grueling tasks of accounting for the collective, and several interviewees spoke of the attempt to balance their own positions of holding power and having academic security by securing institutional resources.</p>
<p>For all of the institutional requirements that adhere in the FemTechNet archive, members viewed it as an alternative to professional associations and other academically-based projects. Its appeal lay in how it gave space for “ambivalent/ambiguous” affective ways that countered the isolating institutional placements in which interviewees found themselves. Collective members repeatedly brought up the Allied Media Conference and activist approaches to organizing as possible new forms for the collective. Among the reasons for a shifting toward activist approaches were an undoing of hierarchies of institutional prestige, the incorporation of activist ethics, and a “distrust of institutions in [the] neoliberal model.”</p>
<h2 id="affect-and-trace">Affect and trace</h2>
<p>Affect was a salient feature in how interviewees described the collective. Even though affect was intentionally flattened in the records that form the archive, there would be no documentation without the affective resonances that drew members to the network. Affective features of the network were described in its countering professionalism and professional isolation, as a motivator for continuing the work of FemTechNet, and as consistently, though ephemerally, enacted and informed feminist practice.</p>
<p>Interviewees noted the danger of documenting affect not only in its inherent vulnerability but also in light of the institutionally created binary between professionalism and emotional expression. Interviews often described FemTechNet in comparison to institutional professionalism through statements that “when you are in academia you are always in a competitive environment &hellip; I don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time with these folks but there&rsquo;s a sense of support.” They noted that “productivity comes second” (to well-being) in the efforts of the collective, and that the effort undertaken to make contact and to observe others’ affective states could not be captured in documentation and could be professionally deleterious for more precarious members if it were available.</p>
<p>The draw of the network was, for many, this affective resonance. It was desirable for what it represented — a feminist ethos that many members shared prior to their decision to join FemTechNet. It offered an alternative to “feelings of isolation common around feminist scholars.” Several interviewees, in discussing their personal relationships to institutions, noted feeling alone and that it was “very significant having colleagues.” FemTechNet met a lack that many interviewees experienced in affectively repressive institutional environments.</p>
<p>Affective salience was also part of what kept individuals in the network. FemTechNet’s position as a “very open space to emotion and interpersonal attention” provided a respite from often spiritually crushing institutional placements (one interviewee noted that it allowed her to “continue to work in institutional locations&hellip; instead of feeling like dying all the time.” ) The value of affective ties within the network surpassed the personal costs of often unpaid labor. Within their personal relationships that were facilitated by the collective, members could admit that, despite their best intentions, they were exhausted by the movement between professional and other realms. Relationships with other FemTechNet members provided forums to admit feelings of being drained by the requirement to be driven by personal passion in the production of FemTechNet materials or the emotional weight of affectively saturated interactions with students. Interviewees expressed the marginalization they experienced in their institutional placements in opposition to the joy, sorrow, and complexity they moved through and co-created with FemTechNet friends and colleagues. They had weathered storms with other collective members — “FemTechNet: We cry together” — and learned the subtle nuances of each others’ moods and humors. The strength of affective bonds was clear through descriptions — “we love each other,”  “it was always the thing — no one could believe they were going to the meeting and then halfway through — joy.” These bonds were not always pleasant — they involved forgiveness, patience, and an acknowledgement of tension. They were also, ultimately, productive in illustrating the goal and intentions of the overall network, in meticulously crafted and anonymously published materials, and in the “astonishment, joy&hellip; the affectual nature” of research itself.</p>
<p>Affect was everpresent and elusive, even beyond interviewees’ descriptions of active forces as motivators for joining and continuing in the collective. While the processes of affective efforts were most present in the check-ins at the beginnings of meetings, statements about FemTechNet were almost always followed by descriptions of the ephemeral encounter. At times, attempts to retain and foster that ephemerality meant that recording Bluejeans meetings might lessen the likelihood that people were open with one another when they met. Adding to the passing nature of check-ins were accounts of the raucous face-to-face encounters — encounters that, at times, took place after years of virtual interaction and co-production. In-person encounters allowed for deeper connections between members and gave (for some interviewees) a sense of depth and reality to on-line meetings.</p>
<p>The introduction of new technologies and new uses of technologies were noted as increasing the affective ties within FemTechNet. Bluejeans (a video and chat platform) was one of the ways institutional ties could be leveraged for the (affective) purposes of the network. Within Bluejeans meetings, several types of communications occurred — from spoken to chat to gestural — with people performing in the medium in particular ways. For instance, one interviewee noted several people in the chat who were “really funny&hellip; riff off of what people are saying out loud.” Another noted that affective relationships to technology — proclivities toward, avoidance of — shaped the nature of affective relationships between individuals in the network. In this description, newly introduced technologies were shaped by their use (and misuse) and subsequently shaped instantiations of the network. Implied and collectively held understanding of specific virtual platforms (such as Facebook groups) and technologies also shaped how, if ever, individuals interacted with one another. FemTechNet participants were not perceived as understanding they were contributing to an archive; it would be unethical, ultimately, to include their contributions, despite the exchanges (on Facebook, for example) taking place on what is often viewed as ademocratic spaceand through another lens asultimately proprietary.</p>
<p>New technologies were noted as increasing the playfulness within the network. Highlighted here were .gif parties — a kind of technologically enhanced hanging out. Bluejeans, specifically, was noted for the level of intimate knowledge it facilitated. With video chat, meeting attendees witnessed one another’s body language, modes of speech, and more. One interviewee, in describing the scope of this disclosure, noted seeing “rooms, kids, pets, partners, some of our members at conferences, on buses.” The platform allowed individuals who often had strong affective ties prior to its use within the collective to suddenly encounter one another in lived, though spatially distant, contexts. This level of knowledge, as one interviewee stated, gives “testament to all the things that hadn’t been recorded and couldn’t be recorded” : the necessity of affective absence, of many forms of quiet, in the archive.</p>
<h2 id="internal-shifts-toward-critical-race-theories">Internal shifts toward critical race theories</h2>
<p>The emphasis FemTechNet placed on articulating critical approaches to race brought about an internal, though unrecorded, shift to address racism within the collective. A few of the interviewees mentioned racism and awareness of power dynamics in their reflections on FemTechNet. For some, working against racism heightened their sense of being identified or made more precarious through the archive. For others, the ways that research occurred in the academy were tinged with a denial of post-colonial, third world feminist methodologies. The possibility of using these methodologies in FemTechNet was part of the allure of being a member of the collective. While a collective member described race and racism as “an issue that came up all the time” (especially in relationship to the inclusivity of the network) the manifestation of power and oppression <em>within</em> the collective was rarely brought to the fore by interviewees.</p>
<p>Rather than rupture, interviewees described a long and ongoing process borne out of patience and an awareness of others’ familiarity with specific concepts. In practice, the creation of a public face of FemTechNet involved a process of language shifting, of rewriting and editing documents, and of constantly addressing moments in which power (and oppression) inadvertently were reinserted into FemTechNet materials or processes. There was, and is, an ongoing “conversation across difference” that aims to educate from many points. These difficult, ever-vigilant conversations were described in relation to people of color and third world feminism as well as trans feminisms. The ongoing energy for this work, and its impetus, was notably not described as an outcome of FemTechNet. Instead, it rested in the appeal and the possibilities of the network, which was how “people found people they could work with, found the things they needed.”</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Absences do leave a trace for those who feel them, who recognize a haunting, who know the impossibility of coherence without some affective tug. The interviews with FemTechNet members trouble the idea that absence in the archive always occurs due to erasure, complicating it with the voluntary acts that limit certain records from entering the institution. Voluntarily engaging in silences occurred out of a sense of self-preservation and also as an act of the love that interviewees attest exists within FemTechNet. Selective silence and affective absence in the records of FemTechNet served to protect the individuals composing the network and the entire network from eaily-predictable harms that might arise if the collective’s records were to be made publicly available. Interviewees described collectively and individually leveraging resources, recognizing precarity, and looking out for one another as an overarching ethos within the collective, made prominent through contrast to the possibly flattened archive of FemTechNet records.</p>
<p>My own reflections, findings in archival research, and the interviews conducted with FemTechNet members reveal that affective absence is not always or solely a direct product of institutionalizing a group’s records. Rather, the institutional affiliations of FemTechNet and its members negated the possibility of affective presence due to possible threats of loss of resources or professional standing. Collective members interviewed in this research shared their awareness of navigating affect within FemTechNet records even prior to the beginning of an extended discussion about archiving their work. In acts of self- and collective-preservation, their absenting of affect from the record was not undertaken to deny the existence of affect as a central tenet of the feminist collective. Instead, it invites the feminist archival user to make assumptions, however imperfect, about how affect connected the network. This article may frame understanding of what users of the archive may (or may not, or cannot) encounter should the FemTechNet archive be made publicly available. In addition to affirming the affective trace that suffuses the space between FemTechNet’s records, it also offers models for understanding how feminist collectives maneuver among and between institutions without becoming subsumed by them. Interviews in this research attest to the possibility that a raucous feminism can be held alongside the effort of meeting institutional demands.</p>
<p>Unseen labor infuses the archive — in the suppression of affect, the records not made or lost, and the effort of documentation required by academic institutions. An interviewee raised that unpaid labor also occurs in this research. The institutional support of FemTechNet, and its limits, meant that the members I interviewed were speaking to me on their own time and out of their own desire for a more informed approach to the archive. While anonymity does potentially shield individuals from nefarious readers (for these exist alongside the possible nefarious users of the archive), it does not and cannot give them the credit for the work they so fully deserve. That credit then, as with the anonymously authored documents produced by the collective, will have to be distributed throughout FemTechNet.</p>
<p>Future research might explore how collectives such as FemTechNet move from institutional models to collaborative, activist instantiations. Looking to other groups that straddle the professional and institutional demands of academia and their own wild and unruly goals may provide better models for doing just that. Then again, it may be enough for all who flauntingly move across the porous boundaries of institutions, that to encounter the hint that others also do this, have also done it, and continue to do it still.</p>

Couch (1939) declared, “The people, all the people, must be known, they must be heard. Somehow they must be given representation, somehow they must be given a voice and allowed to speak, in their essential character” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#couch1939"> [couch1939] </a>. His zeal for a new method of documenting social history reflected his belief in a more democratic vision of American expression, which also starkly contrasted with growing fascism in Europe during the 1930s. In order to give “the people their voice,” he helped to craft the Southern Life Histories Project, which charged Federal Writers’ Project (FWP) workers with interviewing and documenting the lives of everyday people in the American South. The collection is composed of nearly 1200 life histories that are entertaining, insightful, heartbreaking, and, on the whole, say as much, if not more about the writers than the interviewees. Because of the outbreak of WWII and political turmoil within the program, there is not much remaining evidence relating to the interviewees, the writers, the editors, or how precisely these life histories were written. Instead what remains are the stories themselves, while the labor behind them is obscured even rendered invisible.</p>
<p>As many Digital Humanities (DH) scholars and workers know, this situation of having a product with little to no knowledge of the labor behind its construction is rather common. We create DH projects for particular audiences, but the decisions and labor behind their construction remain hidden as they are not the end goal of the projects. At the November 2016 Symposium on Invisible Labor in the Digital Humanities at Florida State University, Mark Algee-Hewitt referred to this issue as one of the great paradoxes of DH. In order to better understand this great paradox, the symposium centered on three key themes: (1) divergent expectations, (2) unequal labor, and (3) invisible work. Within each of these themes was a discussion of the core tension in collaborative DH projects about how to distribute and value labor, especially when decisions about the direction of research and allocation of funding are not evenly dispersed, which is often the case in the hierarchical system of the academy.</p>
<p>In discussing these broader themes, the topic of student labor emerged, which by and large is an area that DH has yet to properly take on, especially undergraduate student labor. As Spencer D.C. Keralis explains in his poignant chapter on labor in <em>Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments</em> , “if there is a spectre haunting digital pedagogy, it is the spectre of labor” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#keralis2016"> [keralis2016] </a>. This spectre results from the fact that students are often given what is thought of as the most mundane work, such as scanning material and data entry. Labor that is “rendered invisible, alienable, and is easily effaced and taken for granted” when looking at the final product. While such a labor structure is almost always uniformly bemoaned as unfortunate and unfair, few actually take the time and effort to work to disrupt it in their own DH work. In order to address this spectre of labor, we ask what would it mean to turn this seemingly mundane or taken-for-granted work into an opportunity to teach and re-envision undergraduate DH pedagogy? How can we use DH methods themselves as the means to represent such labor? This essay answers these questions by outlining our efforts to address labor inequities through our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes federal New Deal documentary projects including photography and life histories. For us, the answer to these questions lied in privileging the pedagogical affordances of data construction by crafting a workflow that included undergraduates as intellectual partners, and using DH methods to visualize and make public this collaborative labor.</p>
<p>We will begin with an overview of Photogrammar and the constellation of labor that the project has required, and then highlight two strategies for valuing labor and making labor visible in the digital humanities. First, we discuss how this project served as tool for teaching undergraduate students key methods in DH by giving them experience with conducting original research with credit on the public site. In this way, we explain how pedagogy can become a part of project development. Second, we argue that DH visualization techniques can make the labor behind DH projects visible. We focus on how Photogrammar uses a timeline and network analysis alongside the traditionalAboutpage to make visible all participants in the project.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> We end by discussing politics of attribution when working with university, governmental, and private historical organizations, including domain names and use of organizational logos.</p>
<h2 id="context-photogrammar-southern-life-histories-project-and-data-construction">Context: Photogrammar, Southern Life Histories Project, and Data Construction</h2>
<p>In 2010, Photogrammar began as a collaboration between Lauren Tilton and Taylor Arnold. Tilton was interested in the representational politics of the Farm Security Administration-Office of War (FSA-OWI) Information, which employed among the most influential documentary photographers of the century such as Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, and Gordon Parks. They produced iconic photographs of the Great Depression that were often in support of the New Deal state and, with the onset of World War II, turned their gaze toward constructing an image of an affluent and strong nation ready for war<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stange1986"> [stange1986] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#trachtenberg1988"> [trachtenberg1988] </a>. Yet, the collection was difficult to navigate through the Library of Congress website. Tilton reached out to Arnold, a statistician, and they worked together to scrape and map the 170,000 photographs from the collection. They developed a prototype, which then received an NEH Office of Digital Humanities grant.</p>
<p>With the grant, the collaboration extended to include Laura Wexler, who was the grant’s Primary Investigator; Ken Panko and Trip Kirkpatrick, who served as Project Managers; Stacey Maples, who served as the Map Expert; and Peter Leonard, who served as an Implementation Coordinator. Tilton and Arnold were named Co-Directors. Over the next several years, they built the web-based platform for organizing, searching, and visualizing the 170,000 photographs from the FSA-OWI. In 2015, Courtney Rivard from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill joined the Photogrammar team with the idea of adding aspects of the Federal Writers&rsquo; Project as a map layer. Then in 2016, Photogrammar received an ACLS Digital Extension Grant to place the FSA-OWI photographs in the larger federal effort to document America during the Great Depression. The grant included funding to build out several components including the addition of the Federal Writers’ Project’s Southern Life Histories Project from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill’s Southern Historical Collection.</p>
<p>The Southern Life History Project (SLHP) was part of the larger Federal Writers’ Project created under the New Deal as a way to put unemployed writers to work. In many ways, the SLHP marked a major shift in forms of documentary expression as its goal was to capture the life stories of everyday Americans from their own perspectives. W.T. Couch saw these life histories as way to collect accurate and authentic accounts of the hardships of life during the Depression with special attention to marginalized voices such as African Americans, women, and working class individuals. For him, the South faced many problems that needed to be solved, but sociological data that focused on data and numbers obscured the realities of life and failed to move a general public to enact necessary changes. Instead he thought that real stories by real people constituted the type of evidence that had the power to create change. However, like other forms of documentation that purported authenticity, the life histories tell readers as much about their creators, in this case the federal writers, as they do the interviewees. Moreover, the writers’ use of representational practices often demonstrate how racism, sexism, and inequality were perpetuated in stories of the quotidian. Because of their complicated composition, they serve as an important companion to the FSA-OWI photographs that were taken during that same time period. Both projects sought to document the American experience and negotiate the desires and needs of those who documented, those who were documented, and the funding agencies. Our goal was to bring together these life histories and the FSA-OWI photographs in the Photogrammar platform to allow users to explore the documentary work of the Great Depression era, and the reason many scholars have labeled it the “documentary decade” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#stott1973"> [stott1973] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#finnegan2003"> [finnegan2003] </a>.</p>
<p>When making the first version of Photogrammar, the project greatly benefited from decades of work by the Library of Congress to digitize the photos and to create the extensive metadata that accompanied them. This was not the case with the life histories. Like many other projects involving archival documents, the life histories layer necessitated creating, cataloguing, and organizing metadata from the archival material, together with marking up and cleaning the individual documents before the material was ready to be integrated into the Photogrammar platform. In this case, the metadata centered around the names, races, and genders of both the writers and interviewees for each life history so as to optimize search functionality within the collection as well as to generate visualizations that analyzed the collection in new ways. While this may seem a straightforward process, it was quite murky as the metadata had to be extrapolated from stories created through a writer’s interpretation of an interviewee’s life often written as a conversation that did not unfold in a linear progression.</p>
<p>This data construction phase of the project is often the backbone of DH projects, especially those that use visualization and text analysis. While this process is crucially important, it is frequently the part of the project that receives the least attention and attribution. Such inattention is likely because data is often understood as that which is given, or as already existing<a class="footnote-ref" href="#rosenberg2013"> [rosenberg2013] </a>. One frequently hears a DH scholar talk about “their corpus” of books, photographs, or archival material. Yet, making these sources computationally tractable is a significant undertaking. Turning a PDF of a piece of writing into clean, plain text can take expensive software and people who manually correct errors. Organizing the sources online or for analysis often involves creating a tabular database; a process that requires creating metadata. Bringing attention to the constructedness of the process is one of the reasons Johanna Drucker argued for using capta, that which is captured, rather than the term data<a class="footnote-ref" href="#drucker2011"> [drucker2011] </a>. In reality, making a corpus requires countless decisions over what actually counts as data and how to create such data. Therefore, by referencingthe corpusboth the interpretative decisions in data creation and the labor that makes data available (particularly those who collect, store, and preserve these sources) are obscured through the singularity of the term. Moreover, data construction is just one component of the complicated labor network of digital projects. Responding to the work of scholars such as Amy Earhart, Miriam Posner, and Roopika Risam, Spencer Keralis explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The labor network necessary to produce digital projects is complex, ranging from the physical labor of maintaining hardware and the infrastructure essential to these projects, to hybrid laborin which machines combine with humans to perform tasksin software or with devices, to scripted tasks performed automatically within systems, to the writing of those scripts, to the knowledge work that serves as the intellectual foundation of a project, to the instrumentalized labor of workers who perform repetitive tasks that cannot be scripted<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#keralis2016"> [keralis2016] </a>.In efforts to re-envision the data construction phase of this project and dwell in the murkiness of its labor rather than to move past it as quickly as possible to get to the final product, we used the data construction phase as a pedagogical opportunity to teach students about the rhetorical nature of data. We aimed to animate the undergraduate classroom by including students in the decision process for one way of valuing labor is identifying opportunities and outcomes that also benefit the person laboring. We accomplished this by building Rivard’s new course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) classes into the data construction phase of the project.</p>

<p>Many DH practitioners have noted the lack of opportunities available to undergraduate students to gain DH skills and experience unless they are able to join a research project run by a DH scholar in their university<a class="footnote-ref" href="#anderson2016"> [anderson2016] </a>. Moreover, the students who become part of such projects are often thrown into the projects and told to “figure it out” making for a challenging process of skills acquisition. This problem of giving undergraduates genuine research opportunities while at the same time teaching them necessary methods and research skills is one faced by most areas of the university. To address this issue, many universities have begun initiatives to incorporate genuine orrealresearch projects into the classroom often in the form of CURE courses (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ishiyama2002"> [ishiyama2002] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#lopatto2010"> [lopatto2010] </a>. While such courses are most common in STEM fields, we aimed to merge this approach with the project development of the life history layer of Photogrammar. In other words, rather than viewing data construction as a monotonous task that needed to be quickly accomplished, we used it to accomplish pedagogical goals that focused on undergraduate research and skill acquisition, thereby re-envisioning this labor as pedagogical in nature by shifting our understanding of the goal of data construction.</p>
<p>This approach of building pedagogy into DH project development was aided in large part by the organizational structure of the Southern Life History Collection (SLHC) and pedagogical resources made available by UNC, two factors that must be in place to enact this type of project development. The SLHC is located at the Southern Historical Collection on UNC’s campus, which meant that students had easy access to the original archival material. Additionally, though written in the 1930s, the writers of the life histories already understood the importance of collecting data to organize its collection because at the beginning of almost every life history is a listing of extremely helpful metadata including information relating to the writer and the interviewee (see Figure 1). This easily discernible metadata that introduced a reader into the life history provided the beginning of metadata schema that could be used to organize the data that would be incorporated into Photogrammar. It would have been possible to simply use this schema to generate the data needed for the project ourselves; something that we could have done rather quickly. Instead, we decided to slow the data construction process down in order to turn it into a pedagogical opportunity to include undergraduates in a course-based setting. The importance of engaging students in the data construction process has been well-documented in the literature on statistical education, an idea that should be extended into DH pedagogy<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hydorn2018"> [hydorn2018] </a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the decision to incorporate undergraduate pedagogical goals into the data construction process of the project was influenced by an initiative at UNC to promote CURE courses across campuses, which included providing faculty with resources on how to incorporate authentic research experiences within the structure of a class. At the same time, Rivard was collaborating with a faculty working group at UNC focused on bringing data studies into humanities curricula.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Therefore, UNC offered concrete resources and incentives to promote course-based undergraduate research that fostered the development of DH skills. Such resources and incentives allowed us the opportunity to take pedagogical risks.<br>

</figure></p>
<p>Seizing these opportunities, we brought students into the project as collaborators in a new upper division, undergraduate course at UNC taught by Rivard on digital rhetoric in Spring 2016 and again in 2017.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Students were positioned as leaders of the North Carolina section of the Life Histories Collection, which constituted approximately 600 life histories. As will be explained in greater detail below, students were charged with creating a metadata schema for the inclusion of these life histories in Photogrammar, and then to use this data as the basis of a research project that they could publish in an undergraduate research journal. By bringing students into the Photogrammar project, Rivard aimed to demonstrate to students the ways in which data construction was a rhetorical act as students, themselves, were in charge of the decisions behind the data.</p>
<p>Such an approach of learning by doing is at the heart of recent advances in the field of digital rhetoric. Douglas Eyman defines digital rhetoric “as the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances” that must provide methods for both evaluation and making<a class="footnote-ref" href="#eyman2015"> [eyman2015] </a>. To teach students the methods of evaluation and making embedded with Eyman’s conception of digital rhetoric, a number of scholars in Composition and Rhetoric have demonstrated the need to more specifically focus on information literacies and data literacies<a class="footnote-ref" href="#purdy2011"> [purdy2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sweeney2012"> [sweeney2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#vetter2014"> [vetter2014] </a>. To this end, Nathan Johnson argues for centering information infrastructure within rhetorical studies, explaining “infrastructure provides the invisible scaffolding for discovery, dissemination, access to information,” and as such has real consequences for “public communication, knowledge, and political life” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2012"> [johnson2012] </a>. Therefore, teaching students not only how to navigate, but also to construct information infrastructures is key to developing information and digital literacies.</p>
<p>These are, of course, the same goals that shape much of DH pedagogy as Alexander Reid explains. He writes, “the promise of the digital humanities lies in its potential to address the political, ethical, and rhetorical challenges of living in a digital age” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#reid2015"> [reid2015] </a>. Therefore, many in DH promote curriculum that allows for “tinkering” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#sayers2012"> [sayers2012] </a>and as Burdick, et. al. explain “hands-on, experiential, and project-based learning through doing” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2016"> [burdick2016] </a>. However, this approach has often led to what Brandon Locke calls “tool based literacy” in which students develop “ tech skills &hellip;through narrow technology that limits potential outcomes and often monetizes user-created content” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#locke2017"> [locke2017] </a>. Such an approach can be helpful as it allows for “low stakes” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#anderson2008"> [anderson2008] </a>tinkering, but it does not train students in, as Locke states, the “critical evaluation of digital media and the means to produce them” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#locke2017"> [locke2017] </a>.</p>
<p>We argue that cataloguing, indexing, and curating archival materials offer one avenue for teaching students data and information literacies while avoiding a tool-based approach.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> This approach simultaneously demonstrates the consequences that information infrastructure has on shaping knowledge about the past. As Graban, et. al explain, “the means of archival organization are rhetorical acts deploying arguments about relations, power dynamics, and gate-keeping methodologies and should be treated as such” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#graban2015"> [graban2015] </a>. Therefore, inviting students to come into a project in which they were responsible for creating the system used to describe archival materials put them in the driver&rsquo;s seat of this powerful act of shaping the information infrastructure of our DH project. Specifically we charged students with: (1) creating a metadata schema for the inclusion of the life histories as layer for Photogrammar, (2) generating metadata for ten life histories, (3) marking up three life histories with XML, (4) giving a Skype presentation to Tilton outlining their rationale for the metadata and mark-up schema, and (5) creating data visualizations from the metadata to construct an original argument that they then were encouraged to publish in <em>People, Ideas, and Things</em> , an undergraduate research journal at UNC.</p>
<p>Knowing that they had the power to shape the infrastructure of the life history layer helped motivate students to think critically about their decisions, especially those involving their metadata schema and tagging decisions. For example, students deeply struggled over how to tag gender and racial categories. There are many instances in the life histories in which the writers named women with their husbands’ names as was common at the time as seen in the story of Mrs. Jake Bowen in Figure 2. Students had to decide whether to tag her with her husband’s first name, i.e. Jake, or read the story for context clues for her first name, Virginia. Therefore, they grappled with whether or not to<br>

<p>replicate the documentation system of the federal writers to maintain authenticity or employ more inclusive practices in line with contemporary standards. These are the same issues faced by archivists today, so we looked to articles such as Duarte and Belarde-Lewis’ excellent piece, “Imagining: Creating Spaces for Indigenous Ontologies” to learn about ideas such as co-locating and composing for audiences represented in the collections rather than colonialist naming practices<a class="footnote-ref" href="#duarte2015"> [duarte2015] </a>. This led students to also decide to co-locate racial categories. The federal writers used racial categories common to 1930s, which the students found unacceptable and impractical for a contemporary user, so they chose to use multiple terms for each racial category. One student, Julie Hayes, explained this point in her final paper, which was published in UNC’s <em>People, Ideas, and Things</em> journal. She stated, “this procedure [of data construction] involved much rhetorical decision-making; for instance, outdated racial terms were replaced with more contemporary and searchable words, thus reflecting the shifts in social norms in regard to race and the resultant changes in language” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hayes2017"> [hayes2017] </a>. Therefore, by thinking through the consequences of their tagging systems, students understood their work as knowledge production.</p>
<p>In order to encourage students to think about how to make their decisions transparent by documenting them, they included them in their XML headers with interpretation tags within the project description (see figure 3). After tagging their life histories and marking them up, students used Tableau to visualize their data. Here they looked for patterns in the archive by analyzing it from a distance<a class="footnote-ref" href="#underwood2017"> [underwood2017] </a>, an approach that had never been used to analyze this collection. Knowing that they were looking at the collection in new ways because of the data that they constructed gave them a profound sense of accomplishment, and positioned them as knowledgeable researchers in their own right. Moreover, their decisions fundamentally shaped the infrastructure of the Photogrammar project. Therefore, students learned digital skills such as data visualization, mark-up, and database management while developing critical digital literacies that saw data construction as knowledge making. Though we could have certainly come up with a metadata schema for the life histories more quickly in a few weeks rather than over the span of a year, the pedagogical affordances of this approach were an important end in themselves, and gave students the opportunity to work on DH project that is legible and transferable to their future endeavors. In order to focus on transfer, Rivard spent the last week of the course helping students translate their classwork into points on their resume as well as addressing how to discuss the project in an interview. As a result of this focus on transfer, a number of students have used the project to secure internships and summer research opportunities.</p>

<p>Together with these course-based experiences, many students at UNC and the University of Richmond were eager to participate in the Photogrammar project, which led us to hire Research Assistants (RA). We tried to find a balance between the needs of the project and the kinds of experiences the RAs sought by working with each RA to identify the type of work that would help them accomplish their scholarly and professional goals. A number of students who were in Rivard’s classes — Carla Aviles, Karissa Barrera, Kayley Bryson, Sarah Moody, Sara Siemens, Elizabeth Bonesteel, Grace Hildebrand, Scott Robinson, and Lacie Morrison — asked to continue to work on the project to gain experience that they could put on their resumes. Grant Glass, a UNC English graduate student, also helped with some text encoding to explore different theoretical methods that he was planning to use in his dissertation. At the University of Richmond, three students — Bal Artist, Emeline Blevins, and Emily Maanum — worked with Tilton and Arnold at the University of Richmond. They expressed interest in being a part of DH research beyond the Introduction to Digital Humanities course that they took with Tilton. Blevins, for example, was interested in developing DH skills with an eye toward jobs in museums and graduate studies. They worked alongside the students at UNC to add metadata to the life histories. Because they did not receive course credit, Richmond students collected hourly wages according to university compensation rules. This growing group working on Photogrammar required us to reevaluate how to give them credit and make their important labor visible.</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-project-labor">Visualizing Project Labor</h2>
<p>With an expanding set of collaborators, we wanted to highlight that certain people contributed in different ways. Valuing labor means recognizing the various ways people contributed, particularly those who put significant work into a project. In order to make visible labor, we supplemented traditional approaches of attribution with DH visualization methods. This resulted in our utilization of three different forms of acknowledging labor: (1) a page on the site listing and describing textually the Photogrammar team, (2) a timeline capturing the length of time by contributor by component on the project, and (3) a network visualization. While each form has it benefits and drawbacks, we believe that taken together they better reveal the kinds and degrees of labor necessary to build Photogrammar.</p>
<p>The most common form of acknowledging labor is the <em>About</em> or <em>Team</em> page. It often features a list of participants and their roles starting with the PI or Director followed by other team members. It is linear and hierarchical. In the case of Photogrammar, a Team page is available as a subsection of the About page. It lists the people involved and their role. Such a page is particularly well suited for explaining the current state of the project. When one lands on such a page, they expect to see who, at that moment, is the current team and their role. If one has a comment or question, they know who to contact.</p>
<p>Yet, there are drawbacks. The long list of students involved does offer a form of credit, but it reads as a list that risks obscuring the amount of work contributed. Those who are no longer involved in the project are often last, regardless of the amount of work or time they spent on the project. Another challenge is when roles shift. For example, Arnold and Tilton started Photogrammar but could not serve as Primary Investigators on the grants since they were graduate students, and later they were no longer affiliated with Yale University. As a result, the Team page does not capture the four months Arnold and Tilton spent building a prototype of Photogrammar or writing the NEH grant before extending the project to include the larger team. It also does not make clear when Project Management shifted from Ken Panko to Trip Kirkpatrick. Certain students also moved from working within the classroom to Research Assistants.</p>
<p>In order address these issues to more fully represent the labor in the project, we sought strategies for how to balance acknowledging labor while giving participants control over how their labor is documented. We heeded the advice outlined in “A Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights” , developed by Miriam Posner and colleagues, to give students control over how their role is represented. Students may want to reframe their work according to their career aspirations as well as decide to no longer be affiliated by removing their name<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dipressi2017"> [dipressi2017] </a>. To address these issues, students were invited to create a GitHub page and provided with a guide to developing their professional profile on the site. We then linked these sites to their names on the Team page. The students then can customize their GitHub pages to outline their roles on Photogrammar. As students move throughout their studies and graduate, they can alter their profiles to meet their current needs. Moreover, students did not have to develop a GitHub page, but the option was available so that they could have control over how their labor is framed.</p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="Timeline which includes the amount of labor each team member contributed and funding involved." src=""
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw"

     ><figcaption>
        <p>Photogrammar will feature a timeline that outlines the labor and funding involved in the project.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yet, even when text is written to describe the work by a member of the team, this can still make it difficult to capture the amount of time spent on the project for the different contributors. To address these issues, we turned to a timeline to capture the shifts in labor and funding within the project. For each component of the project, we assigned the person to the time span they worked. Work is broadly conceived to include physical as well as affective labor. Here we can see the shifts in the project including the new collaboration with Courtney Rivard and the UNC, Chapel Hill, which then resulted in an ACLS grant. This strategy helped reveal how multiple institutions of higher education became involved, an important aspect considering that student labor was used at Yale University and then University of Richmond and UNC, Chapel Hill. Yet, the timeline still has drawbacks for it assigns a particular task to each person obscuring how interconnected and collaborative the process was and continues to be. Here we turned to another visualization technique — networks.</p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="A network visualization of the individuals who worked on the project. Gray nodes indicate components of the project; green nodes indicate individual workers." src=""
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw"
     srcset=" 500w,
     800w, w" 
     class="landscape"
     ><figcaption>
        <p>Photogrammar is using a network visualization to show who worked on which components of the project. The network is an example of work through 2017.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Network analysis is particularly well suited for revealing collaboration and labor for it literally visualizes connections and interactions between people. The bimodal graph connects each person to the component of the project they helped build. In this case, labor included creating data or building a digital components and includes people who contributed 1-2 days or several months of work. We recognize that one drawback of networks is their ability to represent time, making it difficult to denote the amount of labor; an issue the timeline helps address albeit imperfectly. This strategy was particularly important for acknowledging student labor. Whereas undergraduate student labor in the classroom was noted at the course level in the timeline, each student who served as a research assistant is a node and connected to the Photogrammar component they worked on, which in most cases was the life histories. We developed a network visualization particularly to increase the visibility of student labor. The new visualizations of labor and GitHub links will be a part of a new version of Photogrammar that will be released in 2020.</p>
<p>While these three methods help reveal a significant amount of the work on Photogrammar, the issue of crediting labor is also why we will be changing Photogrammar’s URL from photogrammar.yale.edu to photogrammar.org. While the Photogrammar team did develop some new metadata about the FSA-OWI photographs, it is deeply indebted to decades of work by the Library of Congress to digitize the photographs and build the initial metadata<a class="footnote-ref" href="#arnold2017"> [arnold2017] </a>. When the project was released, media outlets such as CNN and Gizmodo incorrectly credited Yale for releasing the photographs.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> This is despite the fact that the About the Collection page outlines the work by the Library of Congress on the collection and each photo includes a link back to the Library of Congress. Yet, the URL sent the message that Yale owned these photographs. The issue is particularly acute as we will be including documents from the Southern Life Histories Collection, which is housed at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Southern Historical Collection in the next version. The new URL, we hope, will help signal that the project is a multi-institutional collaboration and ask people to look more closely at who is contributing to the project. This will be augmented by logos from the participating institutions and funders when possible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Valuing the creation of the data undergirding DH projects is an ongoing challenge. While it can be a mundane and monotonous task, data construction is an interpretive, iterative, and inexact process. These very conditions necessitate acknowledging and making visible the intellectual work that undergirds DH data. Yet, it can be difficult as it asks us to be reflexive about who is doing what and under what conditions. Such a challenge is why we framed data construction as a pedagogical opportunity for undergraduates and used DH methods to make visible the labor behind Photogrammar.</p>
<p>Our collaborative work with students was fundamentally motivated by a concern to make sure student labor on Photogrammar served pedagogical goals rather than just the labor needs of the project. Once we decided to work with undergraduates, we have and continue to explore ways to give students credit with a focus on increasing their visibility in the project alongside mechanisms such as course credit and monetary compensation. These issues extend to how Photogrammar gives credit to the partnerships that have made the project possible. Our process has shortcomings and is not ideal for all projects. Moreover, invisible labor will continue to haunt Photogrammar as it does across DH and the academy. It can be difficult as it asks us to be reflexive about who is doing what and under what conditions. Yet, we believe that revealing our process and approaches by using methods that are now central to DH is a part of the work we need to be doing as a field.</p>

In many cases, teachers and students must rely on a bricolage assemblage of third-party platforms, each with varying degrees of compatibility and long-term support, when designing digital texts<a class="footnote-ref" href="#eyman2015"> [eyman2015] </a>. This, in turn, can create scenarios where digital compositions are left abandoned or rendered unusable on modern machines due to the fact that they are not housed within stable, sustainable university infrastructures. However, this is not to say that university-supplied resources for digital work are universally lackluster or that third-party software is the only solution to technology-based teaching issues. Rather, this situation demands that we rethink how to navigate the complex interrelationship between university and non-university platforms, especially when asking students to create digital projects using a variety of proprietary or commercialized software in institutional environments. This examination proposes that a revised understanding of access can be a useful framework for revealing, critiquing, and even modifying the oft-invisible boundaries separating university and non-university technology policies or infrastructures, boundaries that might unintentionally stymie the inventive potential of collaborative, interactive digital projects.</p>
<p>The importance of access-based concerns became especially clear to me after a near-derailing of a collaborative game session in one of my upper-division writing classes. While teaching at the University of Pittsburgh during the 2015-2016 academic year, I designed several Written Professional Communication seminars around the open-world video game <em>Minecraft</em> . Students were tasked with composing a variety of documents that mimicked real-world genres — such as technical descriptions of gameplay mechanics and resource guides for new players — based on their first-hand experiences with the game. My rationale for incorporating a video game into a professional writing course was to highlight the idea that professional or technical writers must often negotiate open-ended interactions between other individuals (such as clients or customers) and non-human agents (such as computer programs or physical equipment). In a parallel fashion, the process of designing and documenting an interactive gamespace can mirror many of the same situations or obstacles which professional and technical writers face on a regular basis, seeing as game designers must rationalize the structural features of a video game while also envisioning how other players might interact with said features<a class="footnote-ref" href="#greene2014"> [greene2014] </a>. The hope was that having students compose documents that detailed specific gameplay mechanics and intended player experiences would illustrate the rhetorical dimensions underlying real-world workplace writing scenarios</p>
<p>A few weeks into the semester, I organized a “lab day” where students would come to class with a copy of <em>Minecraft</em> installed on their computers so I could walk them through some basic mechanics of the charming block-based world. One student had previous experiences hosting <em>Minecraft</em> games with her friends and asked if she could create a multiplayer server for our class, which would allow all of us to inhabit the same virtual gamespace simultaneously as opposed to having students explore their own single-player worlds alongside each other. I quickly gave the project a vote of confidence and the student began setting up a server on her laptop. Unfortunately, these plans stalled the morning of our class when campus wifi refused to let the server-host configure “port forwarding” for our multiplayer game. Port forwarding is a process wherein communication requests can be re-directed through a router or firewall in order to remotely access files hosted on another computer, thereby allowing users to create a private network-within-a-network. Unbeknownst to us, university IT prohibited communication requests to be re-directed in such a way that permitted remote Internet access to another device on campus (which, in this case, was a student&rsquo;s laptop hosting a video game server). Restrictions on port forwarding make sense from a security standpoint because they can limit the threat of non-authorized remote connections (i.e., instances where devices could be remotely controlled by malicious software). However, the same policies that regulated port forwarding within university infrastructure also prevented students from using their own computers to create collaborative digital spaces for their classmates. To bypass these restrictions, the student who organized our class server offered to relocate to a cafe down the street so she could use their wifi to host our <em>Minecraft</em> session. For the remainder of the period, I played virtual tour guide for our class while keeping in touch with the server-host via an instant-messaging feature within our university&rsquo;s email client.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting about these policies and impromptu workarounds is that they demonstrate how issues of access can reveal the invisible boundaries which separate university-sanctioned tech practices from non-university-sanctioned activities; the struggles of one student trying to make a multiplayer video game accessible for her peers revealed the invisible policies that demarcate what is (or is not) a permitted usage of digital platforms within university infrastructure and the invisible line where a university&rsquo;s jurisdiction, so to speak, over technology usage begins or ends. It was not until a student ventured beyond the confines of university infrastructure that she was able to take up and apply a new configuration of digital platforms in order to circulate an interactive digital project that could be used by others. Put differently, the ability for a student to facilitate a collaborative peer-to-peer classroom experience was entirely contingent upon whether she resided within or beyond university spaces on both a virtual and literal level. To clarify, I am not implying that our institution had devious machinations to censor student actions. Rather, these teaching misfires highlight the difficulty and necessity of coaxing internal and external (i.e. university and non-university) systems to play nice when composing or distributing interactive digital projects.</p>
<p>I used these difficulties as an opportunity to discuss institutional policies with my class and prepare them for our end-of-semester project, which tasked student groups with documenting and designing a multiplayer <em>Minecraft</em> gamespace that taught users about the values or practices of a given professional community. The rest of our semester was an experiment in playing the game of access insofar as student groups needed to devise their own methods for creating, saving, and circulating their projects among their peers. Several groups purchased accounts for <em>Minecraft</em> Realms, which is a subscription service that hosts multiplayer <em>Minecraft</em> servers for a monthly fee. Because <em>Minecraft</em> Realms handles all technical aspects of server-hosting duties, students did not encounter the same technical issues that plagued our lab day. One student group wanted to implement custom mods in their project so they set up an independent server server with the understanding that the server-host needed to be off-campus in order for group members to work on their gamespace. In each of these scenarios, students needed to manipulate the line separating university and non-university technological infrastructures by creating their own impromptu solutions for cataloging their composing practices and making accessible all the work they had invested in these projects throughout the semester. As our class progressed, these workarounds became central features of student learning experiences and several groups detailed the ways in which they negotiated technical limitations during their end-of-semester presentations. In documenting how they gamed access in order to gain access, students were able to explore larger institutional procedures (one student talked about repeatedly installing <em>Minecraft</em> on temporary laptops loaned out from the campus library while her primary computer was being fixed) in addition to pragmatic concerns regarding digital composing practices (a student who lost nearly all of his progress because of software issues bluntly stated the he learned to “never update to the newest version” in the middle of a project). Hence, issues of access operated as the proverbial canary in the coalmine for identifying the invisible boundaries and policies that structure students&rsquo; everyday interactions with digital technologies.</p>
<p>Over the course of this brief case study, initial questions of access eventually dovetailed into larger questions of digital archiving and preservation; workarounds for making students&rsquo; <em>Minecraft</em> projects accessible for prospective players emerged alongside strategies for preserving these gamespaces in such a way that group members could continue designing their virtual worlds in a consistent, sustainable manner. Despite the unique circumstances surrounding my video game-centric teaching experiment, the intersection between access, archiving, and preservation has been an emerging concern across digital humanities scholarship. Universities have begun responding to these issues by creating initiatives to support the long-term curation of digital work. For example, the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond goes beyond simply backing up files for interactive texts in a static database. Instead, full-time DSL faculty coordinate the development of interactive projects with their respective authors while using a variety of open-source platforms — such as MySQL, Omeka, and JavaScript — to ensure long-term sustainability and broad accessibility of digitally-native texts. Projects curated and hosted by the DSL include “Visualizing Emancipation” (an interactive map that documents the uneven spread of emancipation during and after the Civil War) as well as “Renewing Inequality” (which visualizes how urban renewal projects during the 1950s and 60s led to the mass displacement of low-income and minority communities throughout American cities), both of which encourage users to see these interactive texts as outlets for further research or teaching.</p>
<p>While the DSL is an excellent example of contemporary efforts to protect interactive texts from the threat of digital obsolescence, we should not gauge the success of this initiative based solely on the amount of resources and labor dedicated to producing digital projects. Instead, we should measure the impact of institutional undertakings such as the DSL based on the support offered to authors and audiences of digitally-native work. That is to say, successful institutional support for digital work can be evaluated based on the capacity for audiences across a variety of spaces and settings to engage with digital projects regardless of institutional affiliation or circumstances. Failing to circulate digital work beyond a small handful of faculty members at a specific university would severely undermine the on-going critical contributions of digital projects and their authors, seeing as the scholarly or pedagogical value of many interactive texts resides in their capacity to be actively used by other individuals. Consequently, the DSL&rsquo;s emphasis on ensuring access to interactive texts for audiences beyond those in traditional university environments offers one model that can help scholars and teachers envision what constitutes sustainable university support when discussing resources for digital work.</p>
<p>Initiatives such as the DSL resonate with the same themes underlying my students&rsquo; <em>Minecraft</em> projects in the sense that questions surrounding access can operate as a framework for identifying, negotiating, and even modifying the invisible boundaries that regulate the production or circulation of digital work within and beyond university infrastructures. The success of my students&rsquo; <em>Minecraft</em> projects hinged on their ability to navigate the invisible line separating university- from non-university technology policies and platforms in order to make their collaborative projects accessible to their peers. Similarly, the success of the DSL stems from its ability to streamline the curation, preservation, and distribution of digital texts across university and non-university spaces, thereby making interactive projects accessible to a wide range of audiences. Hence, the small-scale workarounds created by students and contemporary large-scale institutional undertakings both demonstrate how a renewed focus on access can help us re-approach the obstacles that scholars, teachers, and students face when composing digitally-native work.</p>

<p>Beginning in 2015, a group of colleagues in the humanities, information sciences, and libraries at Florida State University met sporadically to talk about their projects, plans, and roadblocks, helping one another ask and answer a range of questions, from critical to technical, without inhibition or judgment. We needed this group, for the immediate and quotidian challenges for faculty pressed with meeting wide-ranging institutional duties, working within balkanized departments, and managing projects without explicit digital humanities programming, had masked a significant yet invisible roadblock to getting our projects done. The absence of a sustainable infrastructure — intellectual, physical, temporal, and human — emerged more than once as the underlying problem, a form of institutional invisibility always acting against our interests and activities in the digital humanities.</p>
<p>Six months later, “invisibility” emerged again during a meeting of the<a href="https://digitalscholars.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/730/">Digital Scholars Reading &amp; Discussion Group</a>, where we were all in attendance, this time to consider discussions from the prior year surrounding the boycott of academia.edu, various instances of cybercolonialism, and building repository environments — all topics that texturized the need for large public research universities like our own to understand and practice the digital humanities as a way of critically questioning our working philosophies. It became clear that “invisibility” was not a simple matter of demanding more recognition in a particular context, but rather a key term in our university ecosystem, and a problem of vital significance for the sustainability of DH.</p>
<p>In November 2016, we hosted the first symposium in our region on “Invisible Work in the Digital Humanities (IWDH)” , based on an awareness of the challenges that resource-straitened campuses face as they struggle to build and maintain the collaborative infrastructures necessary to sustain DH work as a humanistic endeavor<a class="footnote-ref" href="#voss2015"> [voss2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#shirazi2014"> [shirazi2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#wernimont2013"> [wernimont2013] </a>. Fifty attendees from colleges, universities, libraries, and/or DH centers in Florida, North Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia — along with<a href="http://iwdh.cci.fsu.edu/speakers/">three keynote speakers</a>from across the United States — convened at Florida State University on November 17-18, 2016 to talk, listen, reflect, apply, and begin taking action toward starting or sustaining healthier DH partnerships on their own campuses or in their own locales. The resulting<a href="http://iwdh.cci.fsu.edu/schedule/">two-day symposium</a>helped us identify the unspoken assumptions that surround collaboration by exploring<a href="http://iwdh.cci.fsu.edu/themes/">questions about diverging expectations, unequal labor, and invisible work</a>. Our first keynote, Mark Algee-Hewitt, Assistant Professor of English and co-Associate Research Director of the Stanford Literary Lab, challenged the group to consider its underlying assumptions about collaboration. Our second keynote, Cheryl Ball, then Associate Professor of digital publishing studies at West Virginia University, presented alternative notions of un/equal labor by examining the rigors of online peer-review through a disciplinary lens. Finally, our third keynote, Roxanne Shirazi, dissertation and digital research librarian at the CUNY Graduate Center, interrogated visibility as a guiding concept for achieving equitable work, asking us instead to adapt a documentary impulse. The Symposium organizers, along with a cadre of volunteer graduate students, librarians, and faculty, moderated and took notes during the various small-group and large-group sessions each day.</p>
<p>Our goal in designing and conducting this Symposium was to explore the hypothesis that Digital Humanities projects involving content specialists and scholars working with digital experts and technologists, frequently proceed under the assumption that the collaborators share common goals; yet this is not always true. For example, in a typical project between a professor of history and a university digital scholarship center, does the digital scholarship center simply provide a service, or are they considered equal partners in the work? Do both partners necessarily share common expectations or goals, or do they have conflicting desires that could influence the outcomes of the project? The historian might be focused on building an online repository, and the impact of such a repository on the field, how others might add to it, and how to materialize several years’ worth of research that would otherwise go unmeasured, while the digital scholarship center might be thinking about recycling the resulting code for use in other projects, contributing to broader digital scholarly efforts beyond that single project. On the surface, none of these goals is inherently contradictory, but in practice, subtle differences emerge that may influence (or stymie) these partnerships when they go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Articulating these issues for DH scholars, researchers, and professionals is critical for identifying and thinking carefully about the invisible work underlying their projects, yet it seemed to be a topic that received little explicit attention in our curriculum, our journals, and our seminars, outside of discussions of student labor. Over those two days in Tallahassee, several common factors emerged, pointing to what we now recognize as a predictable set of institutional, disciplinary, and epistemic tensions that helped guide the creation of this special issue:<br>
problems associated with prioritizing external over internal validation of DH projects<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ball2017"> [ball2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#brennan2016"> [brennan2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#hsu2016"> [hsu2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ball2015"> [ball2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#waltzer2013"> [waltzer2013] </a>;problems resulting from relying on “DH” as an umbrage or umbrella term<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jones2016"> [jones2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fiormonte2016"> [fiormonte2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#wattrall2016"> [wattrall2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#underwood2016"> [underwood2016] </a>;problems associated with making inclusion or agency the ultimate goals of the Digital Humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#earhart2016"> [earhart2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#risam2016"> [risam2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#binder2016"> [binder2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#duarte2015"> [duarte2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fiormonte2015"> [fiormonte2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#risam2015"> [risam2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#gil2014"> [gil2014] </a>; andproblems resulting from flattening disciplinary distinctions within DH work<a class="footnote-ref" href="#robertson2016"> [robertson2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#senchyne2016"> [senchyne2016] </a>.</p>
<p>While Symposium participants represented a range of institutional types, we consider these challenges primarily in the face of innovating — and then sustaining critical innovation in — the digital humanities on public research-intensive and -extensive campuses, when those campuses operate under a dual deficit of resources and knowledge, delivered through austerity measures determined by their states.</p>
<h2 id="critical-factors-in-invisibility">Critical Factors in In/Visibility</h2>
<p>The conversations that occurred over these two days demonstrated to us that our experiences with in/visibility prior to the Symposium had been determined by its use as a binary construct, if not a standpoint. (See, for example<a class="footnote-ref" href="#losh2016"> [losh2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcgrail2016"> [mcgrail2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fitzpatrick2012"> [fitzpatrick2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#spiro2013"> [spiro2013] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#nowviskie2011"> [nowviskie2011] </a>. While not all of these discussions are motivated by explicit complaints about in/visibility, their recurrence points to visibility as a fundamental intertext in the enactment of digital humanities as a discipline, and moreover as a problem of identification to scale.) Our desire to identify alternative standpoints through the Symposium resulted in the discovery of four paradoxes we face frequently in our work:</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-achieve-internal-validation-without-promoting-utopian-visions-of-dh">How do we achieve internal validation without promoting utopian visions of DH?</h2>
<p>One of the essential questions that emerged for us was, To whom is this work in/visible? Much of the work that takes place in DH projects is invisible to multiple levels of authority, both external to the academy (i.e., the public, state legislatures) and internal (i.e., Department Chairs, Deans, Provosts). This occurs on all scales and even to varying degrees in para-institutional publications, for example, in the coverage of “labor” as a critical topic in discussions in<a href="http://hybridpedagogy.org/?s=labor">Hybrid Pedagogy</a>, as well as a special issue of<a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/issue/view/590/showToc">First Monday</a>dedicated toFeminist Perspectives on Digital Labor. Clearly there are ample institutional practices, ossified academic hierarchies, and individual ways of thinking within different academic roles and communities that contribute to making work that is perfectly valuable seem perfectly invisible, and we must work against such visible flattening. As Kathleen Fitzpatrick writes, “We in the humanities often resist opening our work to these publics, fearing the consequences of such openness…keeping our conversations private, might protect us from public criticism, but it can’t protect us from public apathy, a condition that is, in the current economy, far more dangerous” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#fitzpatrick2012"> [fitzpatrick2012] </a>.</p>
<p>However, we risk creating a kind of circularity to our discussion if we always (or only) privilege invisibilities or labor practices that can be solved by external validation, such as not knowing when enough recognition is enough, not knowing whether there is enough credit and compensation to go around, or now knowing how much of that compensation is in the hands of people, institutions, or systems that are “not us.” Moreover, if we are concerned only with making invisible work visible to external validators, we risk invalidating humanities research entirely, in moves analogous to saying that the humanities matter only in terms of helping STEM students become more well-rounded. We learned through the Symposium that perhaps increasing transparency in DH projects requires a decoupling of transparency from external validation, a recoupling of transparency with internally validated assumptions, and then moving beyond notions of validation as credit.</p>
<p>The problem of invisibility is at its core a problem of validation, where the goal of visibility exists principally to make it easier to validate the internal work of the DH participants. Even then, having decoupled transparency from external validation, we must not, a priori, take any of our activities as an unalloyed good. In a utopian vision of DH, one might imagine that if we all received credit for our work, and if institutions recognized and supported all the parties who worked on a DH project, then all would be well. Indeed, there is much to be said and done to advance those goals. But among other general concerns, saying that “all DH work is by nature collaborative and thus democratically realized” may undercut some good work that needs to be singly authored or individually completed.</p>
<p>Similarly, we may not all want the same things, the same rewards, or the same types of credit. The utopian vision of DH as an ideally collaborative and public activity makes some activities resistant to necessary criticism and questioning. Thus, another reality that emerged during the Symposium was the affirmation that not all DH projects need a lot of hands; often what they need is more time — a commodity for which we can and should collaboratively argue even when our projects have disparate goals. While such fractures in the utopian vision of DH may seem threatening, we argue that they are a useful interpretive lever which can expose the complexities of invisibility in practice. For example, Cheryl Ball’s presentation on the evolution of the open-access platform for the journal Kairos gave us options for imagining how to translate that kind of work into rigorous evaluation tools/measures, adaptable to other local or institutional contexts, for defining scalable levels of involvement, and for accounting for different levels of contribution on our reporting mechanisms, such as curriculum vitae. In other words, Ball argued, we have much to gain by observing the processes of activist collectives such as Kairos journal that serve open-access communities while also preserving the values and ethics of particular scholarly groups or disciplines. While the volunteering and mentoring models underscoring Kairos journal were already reflected in the disciplinary ideals of Rhetoric and Writing Studies, other disciplines may support epistemologies or value systems that give us various opportunities for acting visibly in DH — and thus, for transforming how we think about transparency — by promoting shifts in perspective in other areas of the university (e.g., research, service, and infrastructure), and by scaffolding our DH projects so that they necessarily involve short- and long-term training.</p>
<p>While Symposium discussions reflected the fact that material and technical access are recurring problems across United States institutions, we acknowledge that internal validation isn’t always (or exclusively) obtained through idyllic notions of access, unless and until we can enable the transformative nature of access as an internal goal. Doing so requires thinking innovatively about how to commodify our processes and not merely our projects or products for outside groups. Transformed notions of access would open up spaces for rewriting involvement, for responding humanistically to the market forces driving our universities, and for carving out institutional positionings for our work that supersede the material advantages often associated (correctly or incorrectly) with DH initiatives. Transforming the nature of access also involves increasing transparency of motives and goals, affirming the differences among them, and defining our working communities beyond the question of who has principal control over certain kinds of credit.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-achieve-a-collaborative-vocabulary-for-dh-without-letting-the-digital-humanities-limit-us">How do we achieve a collaborative vocabulary for DH without letting the “Digital Humanities” limit us?</h2>
<p>Another essential question that emerged for us through the Symposium was, How much are our problems of visibility caused by our moniker? As expected, the variety of people, professions, and perspectives represented at the symposium highlighted the multiplicity of definitions of Digital Humanities under which we function. In some respects, “big tent” metaphors have served the scholarly community well, establishing a supra-discipline and welcoming all comers<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wattrall2016"> [wattrall2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ridge2014"> [ridge2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#reid2013"> [reid2013] </a>. However, the big-tent paradigm may prevent campuses like ours from being able to conceive of the uniquely collaborative nature of the DH Laboratory both as a collective and as a group of individuals. Moreover, implying the desire to name the digital humanities as if it were a coherent shibboleth, rather than a set of extant and contrasting methodologies, creates a stultifying vision of what DH could or should be, diverting our attention from how DH can promote transformative notions of access in the immediate and near future<a class="footnote-ref" href="#battles2016"> [battles2016] </a>. While definitions of DH have, often with good reason, sought to situate DH in contrast to existing methods, it is equally important to emphasize the continuity of humanistic modes of interrogation.</p>
<p>Thus, we take as a starting point the assertion that DH work is first and foremost work in the humanistic tradition — the selfsame tradition that may enable us to resist being defined by what we are not. It is a question of humanistic thinking to ask what we value preserving, documenting, and doing the work. It is also a question of humanistic method to ask corresponding questions about practice. In contrast, defining DH work by what it is not (i.e., the “traditional” print-based humanities, the completion of singly-authored work) or what it aspires to be (i.e., “empirical” or “data-driven” , following several lab-based sciences) has the unfortunate consequence of locking us into well-worn modes of thinking about both methods and practice. In that particular fantasy of the field, traditional humanities disciplines might be typecast as the lone scholar toiling in the library, and collaboration becomes a counterbalancing virtue of DH work<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ridge2014"> [ridge2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#anderson2016"> [anderson2016] </a>. In contrast, the science/lab model of the hard sciences, including conventions of generous co-authoring, would become a similarly typecast hero-subject<a class="footnote-ref" href="#keralis2016"> [keralis2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#nowviskie2011"> [nowviskie2011] </a>. Instead, we hope to complicate this binarism altogether, so as to separate out recognizable ideals from harmful truisms.</p>
<p>Mark Algee-Hewitt’s presentation on the nuances of the digital humanities collective afforded us different perspectives between and among the roles we typically name in our project teams, by articulating connections between our humanities economy within the institution and the larger digital economy we share with other institutions. Recommending “collaborative individualism” over “mere individuals collaborating” , Algee-Hewitt drew on his experiences in the Stanford Literary Lab to illuminate the terministic constraints with certain professional roles when they fall under the DH moniker, and to share his observations about who might be more focused on output as a standalone product, and whose contributions to the projects are often overlooked or take divergent forms that are undervalued in an academic context. What emerged from his keynote presentation was this triad of intellectual conditions: the need for individual goals to be brought to bear on a common set of problems; the need to determine the points at which the individual nature of specifically humanities research becomes at odds with the cooperation that is necessary for most DH projects; and the knowledge of how to respond when that is the case.</p>
<p>If the Symposium exposed anything to its participants, it exposed the elusivity of some of our familiar working terms. Without a shared vocabulary in place, we could not always make progress towards practical solutions in the space of our conversations over two days. In addition to the nuances of “in/visibility” , we found we needed more neutrality in other terms, including “service” and “sole author” . In the case of the former, recognizing the inherent flexibility in what it means “to serve” exposes the more expansive view we must take towards notions like “rigor” and “ethics” . In the case of the latter, single-authored work has historically been built on the work of others, whether acknowledged or not. Thus, a more expansive notion of “DH collaboration” would focus not on the existing conventions of marking collaboration but rather on identifying and exercising a generosity of spirit in academic work.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-define-critical-agency-for-dh-research-while-questioning-shared-credit-as-an-end-goal">How do we define critical agency for DH research while questioning shared credit as an end goal?</h2>
<p>A third essential question that emerged through the Symposium was, How does our approach change when we acknowledge that while some forms of labor and laboring bodies are deliberately overlooked by those in power, others are made more vulnerable by greater exposure? More problematic than “collaboration” for many Symposium participants was the notion of “credit” , as credit can occur in multiple forms (monetary, reputation, public acknowledgment, private acknowledgment), yet without yielding participatory agency. Reifying credit in existing academic structures — or, rather, in the presumption of a shared understanding of what constitutes credit — makes it too easy to speak past each other about what constitutes the value of work.</p>
<p>While we agree that credit should be discussed or assigned in the early stages of DH projects and processes, we also acknowledge that it may not or need not always be equal. The Symposium revealed that equal partnerships rely less on equal credit and more on an open communication of goals and on an understanding of cash vs. cache — that is, an understanding that equality may be determined not in precisely the same outcomes for each participant, but each participant should still have access to what they need, whether that is in financial compensation (cash) or in project stakes (cache). Put simply, there are types of credit which are often overlooked in a too-rigid framework of credit equals pay or prestige. It might be more important to have ongoing responsibility for a work, or rights to modify a work, than to have public visibility about one’s past contribution or to have continued ownership of it. Reframing the question of credit as a question of epistemic agency<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fricker2007"> [fricker2007] </a>— as a way of validating others as knowers, and validating their right to know — transforms the shared goal from developing a precise system of attribution to recognizing the agential labors through documenting work and telling the story that we want to tell.</p>
<p>Roxanne Shirazi’s presentation on the labor activities required by truly innovative historical recovery projects challenged us to become less “obsessed with consumer product thinking” and more willing to embrace the processes required by shared emotional labor. Drawing on the work of Lewis Hine and Dorothea Lange, and arguing through the lens of Arlene Daniels’ article on “Invisible Work” , Shirazi articulated a key critical distinction between invisible work and invisible worker, suggesting a four-part matrix for DH collaborative teams to use in complicating their values before determining value: visible valued; visible devalued; invisible devalued; and invisible valued. These interplays, as Shirazi called them, should give digital humanists a clearer sense of what problems to scale in their particular projects. They should further demonstrate to digital humanists that not only does in/visibility not have to operate as a negative binary construct in relational work between librarians and their multiple collaborators, in some cases it can provide critical leverage by enabling other forms of recognition, remuneration, or autonomy. The balance between these interplays is fluid, requiring digital humanists to think creatively and strategically about the spaces in and through which they work, before determining that visibility must occur in the same way for all project participants, or that invisibility is solved wholly through shared attribution.</p>
<p>Provoking us to consider positive invisibility and guarded professionalism, Shirazi ultimately challenged Symposium participants to take up a documentary impulse instead. Thus, our end goal was not the foregone conclusion that everyone needs more credit, but rather the question of how disciplines value and preserve their labor, and what interventions could be made in those values. What is at stake in valuing particular work in particular ways? How do we negotiate the values of differing stakeholders? What have we, in the past, chosen to preserve about our methods or about the process of doing scholarship? Many participants in the room recognized the problem with only using DH to produce a highly equitable labor model. Should some invisible work remain invisible? Should other work be made more (if not totally) visible? What kinds of invisible relationships do we assume or perpetuate when using proprietary tools to do our work, without raising public expectations of us and of our work? Could there be nuanced distinctions between invisible and unseen work (i.e., work that is behind-the-scenes but traceable as opposed to work that has been put under erasure)? It became apparent during and after the Symposium that we need not only decide that visibility occurs through attribution, or that all attribution necessarily increases visibility, or that DH’s main task is to resist the erasure of attribution structures. That kind of accounting procedure — even to one another — does not advance ultimately what we are after, which is the advancement of knowledge and scholarship. We became interested during the Symposium in how we might use DH to articulate and propagate a critique of such labor economies inasmuch as those critiques led us to realize other potential mindsets.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-achieve-legibility-without-flattening-disciplinary-distinctions">How do we achieve legibility without flattening disciplinary distinctions?</h2>
<p>For many researchers and practitioners, the digital humanities are one place where their discipline’s methodologies can best perform or make a critical contribution. Conversely, for many disciplines, it is digital humanities projects that effectively make their critical questions publicly accessible or make their disciplinary approaches more textured. Conflating terms and minimizing disciplinary distinctions may be holding us back from the most compelling reasons why DH matters. At the Symposium, considering invisible work from an ecosystemic perspective brought into deeper relief the relationship between two conflated terms: visibility and value. As Shirazi argued, instead of visibility, we might work toward legibility through a renewed attention to documentation and to the everyday tasks of recordkeeping.</p>
<p>The Symposium’s discussions of the critical value of legibility led two participants — Will Hanley and Laurie M. Wood — to reflect on the particularities of their discipline of History.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The argument they make about collaborative dis/appearances in History seemed important if largely unvoiced at the Symposium, and its importance became easier to discern by the end of the second day. As Hanley and Wood point out, the problem of uncredited (hence invisible) work by collaborators and assistants is somewhat remote, because the workstyle of their discipline is deeply individualist, causing most historians to do their research, analysis, and writing alone. However, their digital historical work involves a different form of invisibility and a different set of consequences that occur when DH paradigms overlay the historical. One consequence of digital history is that, because historians rarely articulate the details of their work process, they are impaired when they wish to share their labor, document their efforts, or show others (i.e., potential research assistants) what they want to do. To assign a research assistant requires, as a first step, that the historian make visible the methods he or she already has in play, but when it comes time to enlist librarians, archivists, graduate students, or even other historians as collaborators, the invisibility of their work becomes an encumbrance because they have difficulty trusting others to do it. If they are not practiced in articulating their approach in ways that can be reproduced by others, then relying on intuition and experience might fail them when the moment comes to collaborate. This raises questions about how and when to delegate work that historians would otherwise complete alone, over lengthy periods of time, and informed by their particular specialties.</p>
<p>Another consequence is that, because a historian’s labors are often made invisible by the writing, much of their own work disappears in the redistribution of digital labor. Historians generate a great deal of what Michael Polczynski and Amy Singer have called the “intermediate product” , or the research materials they produce between the archival records they read and the books and essays they write — notes and indexes informed by years of concentrated study. These notes and indexes are typically idiosyncratic and impenetrable, and thus lost to other researchers. More importantly, they are not always central to the digital tool. Because the intermediate product is not documented and reproducible, it gets discarded and the work must be repeated by other individuals in their own idiosyncratic manners later on. This outcome seems ironic in a discipline so deeply invested in empiricism, where one promise of digital approaches is the opportunity for historians to become more explicit and articulate about their methodology.</p>
<p>Here, Hanley’s and Wood’s concerns about in/visibility are twofold. First, they are concerned with identifying methods (already in use or created for the task) that can be explained simply to collaborators who may or may not already have the needed research competencies, such as with languages or metadata. Second, supervising historians want to ensure that research assistants gain new or improved research competencies, which they can deploy (again) in the individual mode of historical scholarship. Again, the historian has to articulate the necessary skills and methods, which more often remain tacit, but by entrusting the work of historical research to graduate students, empirical methods may inadvertently change. False cognates might be translated incorrectly for the index, or the student may still be learning how to distinguish unreliable from reliable sources and how to replicate complicated workflows.</p>
<p>Though specific to their discipline, Hanley’s and Wood’s uptake of “intermediate products” allowed us to consider that, while recognizing invisible work can be a provocative methodological path, it is difficult to make all empirical involvements equally visible. This difficulty, in turn, urges us consider the different burdens of diversifying roles and the resulting social labors that become involved in that diversification. It matters whether we think of visibility as inherently valuable and invisibility in academic labor as inherently invaluable. Symposium discussions made clear that those value judgments around such terms can be directly misleading, and that there may be critical and practical value in allowing some labor to remain invisible and aiming instead for making labor legible, if it means unflattening how our own disciplines operate.</p>
<h2 id="changing-invisible-mindsets-offering-a-conceptual-framework-to-move-forward">Changing In/Visible Mindsets: Offering a Conceptual Framework to Move Forward</h2>
<p>As co-conveners of the Symposium, we encouraged a roughly hewn discourse, recognizing that a binary relationship between visibility and invisibility was not our aim, and neither was a clean resolution to the problem(s) of recognition. Now, we see the intellectual investment of the authors included in this special issue as central to our understanding and expansion of the ideas ignited at the 2016 meeting. In the following seven pieces — five full-length articles describing original research, and two opinion-driven essays on critical terms, perspectives, or mindsets — Shirazi’s documentary impulse echoes throughout, in individual markers of collaborations, project overviews, and inquiries into praxis and theory. Several of the following contributors participated in the Symposium, though several did not, and together their voices reflect work begun in Tallahassee that gestures toward what still needs to be done across our organizational, disciplinary, and professional statuses.</p>
<p>The issue begins with a position piece, where a call for the interdisciplinary nature of digitally-minded humanistic scholarship is apparent, in Huet, Alteri, and Taylor’s short manifesto “A Life on the Hyphen: Balancing Identities as Librarians, Scholars, and Digital Practitioners” .Their claim that “life on the hyphen&hellip;fuels invisible work” recalls discussions from the Symposium that invisibility and un-seenness are not necessarily the same phenomenon, and they argue that apportioning credit does not always overcome the epistemic assumptions determining unequal labor. The authors ask for shared responsibility with raising the visibility of hyphenated practitioners, while recognizing the cultural academic changes this intersectionality will require.</p>
<p>Community development is a throughline in many pieces that follow. Kasten-Mutkus, Costello, and Chase’s “Raising Visibility in the Digital Humanities Landscape: The Open Mic Event at Stony Brook University Libraries,” illustrates a reliable model for providing space and time to learn from and with one another. Establishing programmatic approaches for digital humanities work is one path toward broader recognition, and the authors examine their own program for that possibility. Recalling a statement from the Symposium, that there are often “radically different concepts of what counts as knowledge production,” this piece shapes the conversation by arguing that investing in the local scholar/practitioner community from a library perspective is productive and generative of/for the digital humanities.</p>
<p>Also concerned with rethinking DH investments, Opel and Simeone’s “The Invisible Work of the Digital Humanities Lab: Preparing Graduate Students for Emergent Intellectual and Professional Work” explores the potential that spaces and informal learning offer to sustainable models of how/who works together. In framing what a DH Lab is and does, Opel and Simeone interrogate and return to central questions of who is in in digital humanities and how the field inculcates new members. Focusing on their Stories with Data workshop series, the authors argue the need “to produce graduate students who can meaningfully render visible to the public how the academy contributes to [or obfuscates] knowledge production vis-a-vis technology” .</p>
<p>Shifting our attention from graduate professionalization to undergraduate pedagogy, Rivard, Tilton, and Arnold’s “Building Pedagogy into Project Development: Making Data Construction Visible in Digital Projects” offers a case study in using a DH method to visualize the labor of a classroom-based project and learning environment. The authors offer three broad strategies for making labor more visible through their experience co-constructing Photogrammar, teasing out the “politics of attribution” within the content the project is studying, and the collaborative relationships in the classroom. Throughout their argument, the authors highlight the need to consider a variety of ways that collaborators, especially students, may want or need their labor to be credited or made valuable to their goals, which may not be the same as the goals of the institutional researcher or project team.</p>
<p>Kelly’s “Gaining Access, Gaming Access: Balancing Internal and External Support for Interactive Digital Project” offers a brief but critical interlude, using a micro case study of a single teaching experience “in order to explore how the oft-invisible policies, procedures, and restrictions shape the way we compose, circulate, and make accessible digitally-native work” . This short essay argues for a logistically-minded approach, emphasizing that hurdles to digital pedagogy can occur in the seemingly mundane, such as limited access to wifi, yet those policies reflect boundaries whose transgression is key for activating critical approaches to our own labor.</p>
<p>Chesley argues for applying those critical approaches to a hybrid collaborative space in “The In/Visible, In/Audible Labor of Digitizing the Public Domain” — this time from LibriVox, the public domain audiobook platform and a unique “public, volunteer digital humanities project” . The invisibility of this volunteer work “is part of the project’s strength and persistence” and resists the generalization that the academy owns all of the digital humanities. Chesley’s inclusion of a citizen-humanities, public service project reveals our utopian biases and divergent expectations toward cultural knowledge production as an academic affair.</p>
<p>Finally, in “Affective Absence: Risks in the Institutionalization of the FemTechNet Archive” , Austin details the dual challenge of re-presenting the labor of others in an archival collection, and the risky work of archival institutionalization. Writing against erasure, Austin says, “The small tasks of addressing power are frequently unseen, unstated, or fed back through institutional lenses — often resulting in approaches that are sanitized or obscured” . Their essay complicates any easy concept of validation, reminding us that some scholarly activities are not subject to, dependent on, or interested in the credentialing system within which we continue to dwell.</p>
<p>Thus, a conceptual framework for continued forward motion is threaded within these works. Taken together, these ideas, provocations, and inquiries mirror and refract the conversation that began at Florida State University in 2016. Together, the Symposium on Invisible Work in Digital Humanities and this special issue make the case that:</p>
<p>care is a first, essential collaborative tool;scales of credit and recognition are varied and variable for every individual connected to the work;the documentary impulse is a useful method for beginning to make labor legible;acknowledging a spectrum of “works” (e.g., volunteer efforts, workflows, and community development) offers an expansive understanding of scholarly activity; andthe inherent paradoxes of DH work, often simultaneously “collaborative” and “singly-authored,” are a great strength, if also a great challenge.</p>
<p>Our hope is that the discovery and uncovering we attempted through this shared project will illuminate many more curious and careful complexities in the digital humanities and that, as individuals together, we will make, ask, and interpret in new and more open ways.</p>

As such, we split our work between different yet often intersecting areas. We answer to the distinct professional worlds of the academy and the library, the human and the digital. Or, to borrow the phrase of scholar Gustavo Pérez Firmat, we live on the hyphen. As hyphenated scholars, much of our work is invisible to either (or both) professional worlds.</p>
<p>Our situation is not unique. Many digital humanists constantly experience the difficulties of having to perform interdisciplinary work. As Bethany Nowviskie explains: “In a field whose native interdisciplinarity verges on inter-professionalism, full-time, long-term digital humanities staff already struggle against the pressure to become jacks of all trades and masters of none.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#nowviskie2016"> [nowviskie2016] </a>Similarly, in 2012, Matthew Kirschenbaum argued the term digital humanities astacticalbecause “digital humanities emerges as a rare vector for jujitsu, simultaneously serving to position the humanities at the very forefront of certain value-laden agendas [&hellip;] while at the same time allowing for various forms of intra-institutional mobility as new courses are approved, new colleagues are hired, new resources are allotted, and old resources are reallocated.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#kirschenbaum2012"> [kirschenbaum2012] </a>As Roopika Risam notes more recently: “This is the promise of digital humanities: critical, generous digital scholarship that has the potential to cross institutional sectors; to overcome the divides between archive, library, university, and museum; and create networked publics.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#risam2019"> [risam2019] </a>Our question is <em>how to realize this promise.</em></p>
<p>In 2017, the Digital Library Federation launched a working group on labor in digital libraries, and in 2018 they released their research agenda in which they discuss research on digital library labor conditions and suggest projects for further research. Also in 2018, Christina Boyles, Anne Cong-Huyen, Carrie Johnston, Jim McGrath, and Amanda Phillips issued a call to “make forms of digital labor and the agents behind this labor more visible” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#boyles2018"> [boyles2018] </a>in their article “Precarious Labor and the Digital Humanities.” We are answering that call by investigating the working conditions of those who live on the hyphen and work as invisible agents of digital labor. As this special issue of <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> is also a call for action, we see an opportunity to discuss our experiences and hope they will lead to more recognition from our various communities, as well as spark ideas for improvement and inclusion in other DH communities.</p>
<p>We enjoy our hyphenated lives, and our ability to build bridges between and contribute to fields we love. But we also are tired, overworked and underappreciated, in large part because our split professional identities often fit us nowhere, marking a particular kind of intersection that warrants recognition.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-intersection-of-overtaxed-and-underevaluated">At the Intersection of Overtaxed and Underevaluated</h2>
<p>Like many practitioners of digital humanities, we frequently find our services and insights in high demand because of our combination of skills. We give guest lectures via Skype and speak at other institutions, not just on our scholarly output but also on librarianship, digital practice, and teaching. We provide support ranging from consultation to project management on large-scale digital humanities projects, and we advise colleagues on smaller digital projects, often serving as both project managers and technicians. We also create our own digital humanities projects based on our research and professional responsibilities.</p>
<p>And yet, despite demands for these services and insights and consultations, we are aware that many faculty do not position us as scholarly equals, and that we are underserved by the outdated criteria used to evaluate our performance. Our supervisors applaud our scholarship yet nonetheless struggle to view research as a billable aspect of our roles and responsibilities, rather than an extracurricular activity done outside of working hours. And they struggle to justify our extracurricular activities according to the guidelines they use to determine tenure and promotion. This makes the invisibility of our work as consultants, technicians, and digital scholars more apparent.</p>
<p>When we do receive credit for our digital research activities, faculty and administrators may fail to understand that our work is necessarily separated between subject-specific research and library research and must therefore be weighted differently. At other times our involvement is neither explicitly librarianship nor explicitly digital humanities scholarship, but still fulfills essential work in the spaces between, causing some of our colleagues to consider us second-class researchers because our work does not fit clearly within one silo or discipline. Suzan Alteri, University of Florida’s Curator of the Baldwin Library of Historical Literature, encountered this problem after receiving grant funding to produce an online annotated bibliography. This digital research project combined Alteri’s expertise in rare books, book history, and children’s literature. While the bibliographic aspect of the project fell under her professional responsibilities, the research required to compile the bibliography and contextualize texts was largely ignored. Having to combine subject research with librarianship makes being a librarian and a digital scholar a real struggle. The invisibility of non-discrete research intensifies the difference from invisible labor to expected presentation, making it acute.</p>
<h2 id="splitting-professional-identities">Splitting Professional Identities</h2>
<p>Living on the hyphen, we are constantly juggling positionings and identities. When someone asks us what our research is about, we struggle to answer. Do we detail all of the work we do: our research in library science, our area specialty, and digital humanities? Or do we only detail research that will be most relevant to the person with whom we are speaking?</p>
<p>Dr. Hélène Huet, the University of Florida&rsquo;s European Studies Librarian, is a digital humanist and a specialist in both book history and the French literary movement known as Decadence. Thus, Huet is both a digital practitioner and a digital humanities expert for the community in which she works. On a given day, depending on whether she is talking to librarians, digital humanists, or French and Francophone Studies scholars, she discusses a different area of her current research. Her example highlights one of the issues we are facing. Indeed, while we love our multi-faceted professional identities, we sometimes think we are losing our identity, and that by participating across so many different fields, we are alien to all of them.</p>
<p>Living on the hyphen takes its toll, as we spread our inadequate research time too thin or fail to adequately demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of our work as scholars and professionals.</p>
<h2 id="realizing-the-promise">Realizing the Promise</h2>
<p>Faculty and administration can take several positive steps toward realizing Risam’s promise and helping us solve the problem.</p>
<p>First, we must all take responsibility for making all aspects of our work visible to others. Therefore, at your next conference presentation, please talk about how you completed your digital humanities project, what tools you used, what decisions you made, who your collaborators were, and how your community and working conditions made it possible. Encourage other presenters to focus on the methodological aspects of the collaboration, as well as the results. Open up calls for papers to include not just scholarly and theoretical concerns, but practical concerns as well. Encourage practitioners and scholars to see each other as equals. This is a call for all of us to be generous, generative, and inclusive.</p>
<p>Second, departments and programs need to revise their tenure and promotion standards to ensure that hyphenated scholars — individuals who increasingly represent the norm within academia — are recognized for their work. This requires reflecting on the origins of the term hyphenated, and is indicative of a change to better support our colleagues of color and colleagues from different cultural backgrounds who face additional demands from hyphenated identities and systematic oppression.</p>
<p>Finally, we all need to push for a cultural change that includes all people involved in academic work thus making visible the invisible work of those on the hyphen, including but not limited to librarians-scholars-digital practitioners. Achieving this cultural change within and alongside other communities pushing for recognition of labor conditions and labor communities only makes sense. Alone, our work is rendered invisible, but working collectively towards changing the daily practices of academia can make the full scope, impact, and import of our work visible. In doing so, we might make visible understandings of work that are appreciative, compassionate, and connected.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The digital humanities are problematic to place. In his explanation of the visionary aspects of the digital humanities, Patrik Svensson<a class="footnote-ref" href="#svensson2012"> [svensson2012] </a>suggests that the interdisciplinarity of the discipline disrupts traditional academic structures. Supporting digital humanities efforts requires an organizational and budgetary structure that universities, siloed into academic departments, are not equipped to support. The academic library, however, transcends some of these traditional boundaries and can be a setting for digital humanities encounters. The unique position of the library as a cross-disciplinary resource can provide space and structure for interdisciplinary connection. The library is the right place to develop digital humanities programing because it has the capacity for multi-view support of projects from their early stages and can facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
<p>With flexible spaces, information resources, and systems for discovering, curating, and preserving information, the library deliberately weaves expertise throughout departments and disciplines. Programs, such as lecture series, workshops, and more informal events, are an important strategy to make visible the library’s potential as an intellectual, pedagogical, and practical center for digital humanities work on campus. Programming raises the library’s profile while also highlighting the problems it faces as a campus entity engaged in the digital humanities, as well as potential strategies to counter them. One key issue is the lack of spaces on campus, both physical and intellectual, for more casual interdisciplinary engagement at the early stage of research or teaching projects in the digital humanities. This lacuna underscores the need to communicate the library’s potential to campus stakeholders, as well as to present it to them in a legible way capable of inspiring collaboration. Librarians at Stony Brook University have taken steps, through instruction, programming, and collaboration, to raise the profile of the library as a nexus of digital humanities activity. This has afforded the library the opportunity to question the role of librarians in digital humanities research, as well as the ways in which digital humanities research enters into dialogue with the interdisciplinarity and modularity of the academic library. As a result of the increased visibility of the library to the digital humanities community at Stony Brook University, librarians formed a working group to combine their talents and expertise in order to provide a menu of services and support which transcends the expertise of any individual member of the group. The synergy and collaborative energy of this group enables librarians to demonstrate their ability to play a broader, more visible role in digital humanities research and to function as leaders in this dynamic field.</p>
<p>This programmatic, multifaceted commitment to creating a digital humanities presence in the library draws its energy, focus, and scholarly network through formal and informal programming. Informal events based around networking and sharing unfinished work in particular are a uniquely suitable format in that they embody a dynamic, permissive, multidisciplinary presentation space that is as meaningful for exercising new and ongoing research (and technologies) as it is for making discoveries and connections. These events, at which faculty and students are invited to give lightning talks about ongoing research, or simply to listen and learn, provided a foundation on which to build the library’s digital humanities program. The openness, inclusivity, and visibility of these events complement and enhance the library’s digital humanities consultation and instruction services, putting librarians in touch with faculty and students in need of support. Additionally, programming and outreach contribute to the visible of the library while simultaneously privileging its interdisciplinarity and the flexibility of its services, spaces, and collections as they are tailored to digital humanities research and teaching.</p>
<p>This article discusses the programming, consultations, instruction sessions, workshops, and working group within the context of collaborative and interdisciplinary work in the digital humanities. In addition to providing an outreach template for academic librarians seeking a resource-light introduction to digital humanities projects and researchers on their campuses, this discussion draws into relief the ways in which the digital humanities challenges and reconditions the role and visibility of the librarian as consultant and collaborator. This forms part of a discourse on the nature of collaboration in the digital humanities and on the library as an interdisciplinary space capable of facilitating and engaging in multimodal research and practice. The digital humanities content at Stony Brook University locates the digital humanities within the library’s repertoire, while signaling that the library is — in a number of essential ways — open.</p>
<h2 id="library-services-and-the-digital-humanities">Library Services and the Digital Humanities</h2>
<p>The digital humanities programming and services at Stony Brook University Libraries provide an opportunity to discuss and problematize the ways in which programming and outreach can help libraries to understand the needs of their digital humanities constituencies. The professional literature is replete with examples of the complex relationship between libraries and digital humanists, as well as the exciting, yet frightening, possibilities of tailoring this dynamic to fit the needs of an individual campus. As academic libraries engage with the digital humanities on their campuses, they are faced with a decision about the degree of involvement they have the capacity to provide. Some librarians are consultants, offering advice to researchers regarding data curation, digital preservation, and GIS or text-mining technologies. Other librarians position themselves as active practioners and partners in the research process, becoming engaged in digital humanities projects on grant applications and as co-authors. Beyond this dichotomy exist other considerations which must be addressed by libraries, including building collections that are mindful of the needs of digital humanists. This can include data visualization and GIS software, or advocating for text-mining rights in digital collections.</p>
<p>After decades of development, experimentation, and growth, many digital humanists point to the value of considering the digital humanities not as an umbrella, but as a rich, diverse, and sometimes unrelated gathering of research practices which bring the humanities into contact with the empirical<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kirschenbaum2012"> [kirschenbaum2012] </a>. This approach tends to destabilize the notion of a monolithic digital humanities in favor of a discussion of individualized research practices and tools intended to promote contact with cultural objects, interdisciplinary, collaboration, and new interpretations of existing corpora. The academic library is ideally situated at the crossroads of these concepts, and has an important intellectual and practical role to play in the continued development of the digital humanities. Kirschenbaum’s foundational essay considers the digital humanities primarily from the perspective of English departments, though his observations regarding the nature of work in the digital humanities are extremely applicable to the interdisciplinary, flexible academic library. Indeed, other chapters in the same edited volume, <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> , as well as the contributions in the 2016 edition, underscore similar points by emphasizing the simultaneously problematic and opportunity-rich dynamic between digital humanists, the humanities, and libraries.</p>
<p>In many ways, the flexibility of the library, its visibility on campus, and the intersectionality of its mission and philosophy render it both neutral and uniquely suitable for early-stage thought. This is reinforced by the library’s frequently consultative and pedagogical role in supporting the digital humanities on campus. Librarians have been extending the invitation to their liaison departments and collaborating with faculty members in their disciplines to produce and support digital humanities projects. This ongoing conversation between librarians, non-library faculty members, and students is reflected in the openness, creativity, and collaboration inherent in library spaces for the digital humanities. That these outreach strategies are successful — even for those who do not attend — is evidenced by the increased visibility of the library in the digital humanities community on campus, as well as the increase in requests for instruction, collaboration, and consultations.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate extended collaboration, Stony Brook University Librarians offer workshops on topics, tools, and practices of use to scholars working in the digital humanities, placed in context by the needs that we observe when working with researchers during and after programs. Examples include a workshop for digital humanists who are interested in incorporating text mining as a research tool, but who may lack the technical background to create their own programs. Using a freely accessible text mining tool, Stony Brook University librarians helped to demystify an important digital humanities practice and to encourage humanists to use it to support their research. Workshops dedicated to other visualization tools, have been popular with students and researchers interested in learning to visualize their data in creative and impactful ways. These two examples illustrate a commitment to providing in-depth, tailored instruction on using digital humanities tools. However, they are also indicative of the ways in which digital humanities work is changing the role of the librarian in research. Workshops offer a platform for librarians to demonstrate their expertise and to share it with a broader audience. Because these events are publicized to the campus community, they also contribute to the libraries’ growing reputation for and visibility as a digital humanities space. Librarians plan workshop content by expanding their own technical and research skills, with the end result that digital humanities workshops carry the dual benefit of improving library services in the digital humanities while simultaneously enhancing awareness on campus of the library as a resource and as a leader in this area. Evidence of these phenomena can be observed in the feedback loop which exists between the advertisement of workshops, workshop attendance or non-attendance, and subsequent requests for individual consultations with librarians.</p>
<p>Librarians also teach course-embedded workshops on creating digital humanities content. It is important to note that requests for these sessions are typically inspired by instructor participation in, or awareness of, another digital humanities event at the library, such as an Open Mic or a workshop. By participating in undergraduate- and graduate- level instruction in topics such as multimodal storytelling, digital humanities tools, open textual corpora, and the role of the library, librarians elucidate the work that they are already doing to support this broad and varied field. Additionally, instruction sessions offer the benefit of introducing the library and librarians to students who are already interested in learning more about the field. This classroom connection has inspired requests for research consultations and further support.</p>
<p>An unforeseen benefit of librarian participation in digital humanities courses, particularly in those at the graduate level, has been the increased visibility of the ways in which digital humanities as a mode of inquiry can enhance or inflect the careers of early career scholars working in humanities fields. The opportunity to become involved in graduate research in the digital humanities is also a chance to demystify librarianship, particularly technically-inflected librarianship, to a group of students who may be interested in pursuing a career outside of the professoriate as it is traditionally conceived.</p>
<p>Taken together, the strategies used to keep in touch with the digital humanities community at Stony Brook University, in addition and subsequent to the start of the Open Mic events series, render visible key questions in the role of librarians in the digital humanities.</p>
<h2 id="cultivating-visibility-through-programming">Cultivating Visibility through Programming</h2>
<p>In order to gain the information necessary to identify and decide how to brand their role in emerging research, librarians need to build strong relationships with researchers, teachers, and students on their campuses. This is particularly important in a digital humanities context because of the inherent interdisciplinarity of the field, as well as the variety of practices which can, are, or could be identified as digital humanities.</p>
<p>To plan and promote the digital humanities in the library, librarians at Stony Brook University drew on examples from the literature. Though there is no direct parallel, many universities have successfully engaged their communities in open digital humanities activities aimed at creating communities of practice in library spaces. In 2015, Arianne Hartsell-Gundy, Laura Braunstein, and Liorah Golomb edited a volume entitled, <em>Digital Humanities in the Library: Challenges and Opportunities for Subject Specialists.</em> In many ways, the contributed essays in this book reflect the inherent overlaps, tensions, and opportunities in the relationship between the digital humanities and the library. Importantly, they also place this dynamic within the context of the broader role of the liaison librarian, with its emphasis on forming close relationships with academic departments in order to provide tailored service. This concept is particularly important in the context of the digital humanities because it is a field which challenges the liaison relationship to expand toward collaboration. Other studies treat this theme from a perspective which emphasizes the nature of collaboration itself. Developing informal communities was one of the themes identified by Hannah Rasmussen, Brian Croxall, and Jessica Otis in their interviews with librarians engaged in digital humanities work. They argue that these context-specific, informal communities of practice are a good fit for the protean nature of digital humanities practice<a class="footnote-ref" href="#rasmussen2017"> [rasmussen2017] </a>.</p>
<p>Harriett E. Green’s article in <em>Library Quarterly</em> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#green2014"> [green2014] </a>explores five examples of digital humanities partnerships, including a project at the University of Virginia (UVA) that began in 1992 with the creation of a dedicated space for electronic text encoding called the Etext Center. Since then, UVA has rebranded as the <em>Scholars’ Lab</em> and expanded the center in line with its mission of digital humanities research and development. In her article about the role of the Scholars’ Lab in UVA’s digital humanities production, Bethany Nowviskie asks whether library centers of the digital humanities are uniquely able to “demonstrate many possible paths, that is, by walking them, and by sharing narratives of failure, success, and ongoing experimentation?” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#nowviskie2013"> [nowviskie2013] </a>. This concept of creating a space of digital humanities connection and experimentation in the exploratory context of the library is particularly relevant to the design of the Digital Humanities Open Mic events at Stony Brook. The Open Mic event was designed to create a space in the Library where students and faculty could encounter one another and produce organic collaborations. Unlike the Scholars’ Lab, Stony Brook’s space is not dedicated full time to this purpose, but the missions are alike.</p>
<p>The creation of experimental and research-oriented spaces for the digital humanities is one of the core advantages of hosting these activities in the library rather than in academic departments. Chris Alen Sula<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sula2013"> [sula2013] </a>found a great overlap between the work that libraries already seek to do to build collections, support scholarship, and provide development opportunities in digital settings and the work involved in producing and supporting digital humanities content. The role that librarians play in the digital humanities process differs greatly between institutions, though Miriam Posner<a class="footnote-ref" href="#posner2013"> [posner2013] </a>makes the case that librarians should act as collaborators rather than supporters of digital humanities projects. She also highlights several challenges to this model including lack of institutional support, training opportunities, and incentives for librarians. SUNY Potsdam College also experienced challenges in marketing digital humanities events but found success in appealing to faculty who then promoted the event to their students<a class="footnote-ref" href="#andrews2014"> [andrews2014] </a>. Certainly, most institutions are not enabled to support initiatives as complex as UVA’s <em>Scholars’ Lab,</em> which makes initiatives with low barrier to entry particularly valuable to libraries facing these challenges.</p>
<p>Several other low-burden methods are outlined in the article <em>Evolving in Common: Creating Mutually Supportive Relationships Between Libraries and the Digital Humanities</em> including participating in the digital humanities conversation in larger online communities via Twitter, listservs, and online resources like the Digital Research Tools (DiRT) Wiki<a class="footnote-ref" href="#vandegrift2013"> [vandegrift2013] </a>. Though Stony Brook’s digital humanities events were promoted via social media, using these platforms to engage with the greater digital humanities conversation is a good future direction. Like the in-person event, digital platforms are an effective way to make connections within the University and with outside researchers working on similar projects.</p>
<p>Digital humanities programs and spaces are opportunities to explore and discover new boundaries to the very nature of librarian-faculty-student collaboration. By engaging outside of the classroom and off the reference desk, librarians “change the conversation” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#nalanimeulemans2013"> [nalanimeulemans2013] </a>with faculty and students through demonstrations of their expertise and scholarship beyond the course-integrated and supporting roles they typically play.</p>
<h2 id="leveraging-librarian-skills-and-identifying-new-directions">Leveraging Librarian Skills and Identifying New Directions</h2>
<p>Building on their existing interdisciplinarity, librarians must develop the tools and infrastructure necessary to support work in the multidisciplinary, multimodal area of the digital humanities. This goal is served by interrogating the tools and skill sets libraries and librarians need to have or cultivate in order to support the digital humanities, particularly with regard to the ways in which they can expand skills, services, spaces, and collections in order to serve a diverse community of researchers, teachers, and students.</p>
<p>Scholars working in the digital humanities at Stony Brook University and at many other institutions are confronted with the problem that their institutions do not have a centralized, supported center for digital humanities research and pedagogy. Though this is arguably less problematic for established practitioners, it can pose enormous challenges to students and to researchers looking to embrace new digital humanities methodologies. At Stony Brook University, individuals working with Geographical Information System (GIS) technologies are supported by the university’s Geospatial Center, which offers consultations, access to GIS tools, and graduate coursework. However, the absence of a dedicated digital humanities center means that researchers working with other modalities risk isolation and confusion. Stony Brook University Libraries, like many research libraries, has sought to remedy this lacuna by working to become a campus leader in the digital humanities and a connector of diverse practices from across disciplines. In support of this goal, the library’s Digital Humanities Working Group is a group of librarians from various sectors of the organization who have interest and/or expertise in the digital humanities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Digital Humanities Working Group guides library engagement in digital humanities work on campus, with an emphasis on the ways in which the University Libraries can provide leadership and vision in this dynamic area of inquiry. The Working Group plans programming, offers a framework for research consultations, and works with liaisons to engage with faculty and students on teaching, learning, and research activities in the digital humanities.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#workinggroupcharge"> [workinggroupcharge] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Working group members possess expertise in a variety of fields, such as humanities, scholarly communication, library technology, web development, and digital project creation. This interdisciplinarity contributes to the kinds of services the group is capable of providing, while also creating a crucible in which ideas about the Libraries’ role in the digital humanities are formed. By engaging members of the library faculty from diverse areas of the organization, the working group model problematizes the notion that the digital humanities must exist as only one department of an academic library. Instead, this inherently interdisciplinary, multimodal field of inquiry can be productively situated at the crossroads of a variety of areas of librarianship. This kind of flexibility also permits a reexamination of the digital humanities in the library as it places it in dialogue with key library and information concepts such as open access, information literacy, and scholarly communication. The group’s inception in the fall of 2017 marks an important step in the library’s journey as a digital humanities organization capable of providing leadership, support, and enrichment to the campus community. However, it is also in many ways the culmination of earlier efforts to build relationships with faculty and students working in the digital humanities, and to use the Libraries’ status as an interdisciplinary locus for scholarly communication as a platform for the creation of a network of digital humanities practitioners at Stony Brook University. This work began with a desire to understand the digital humanities as they existed on campus, as well as to explore the potential role of the library.</p>
<h2 id="engagement-strategies-putting-theory-into-practice">Engagement Strategies: Putting Theory into Practice</h2>
<p>The liaison model which has characterized library outreach and academic engagement for the past several years has important implications for extending library work to the digital humanities. The liaison concept is predicated on the idea that librarians will work with assigned departments or programs. However, many libraries have extended this concept to a more functional model in which librarians work with researchers, teachers, and students at key points throughout their research, teaching, and learning process. These concepts include emerging library competencies such as research data management, bibliometrics, and the digital humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#brantley2017"> [brantley2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#gibson2010"> [gibson2010] </a>. This presents a challenge to librarians related to both expertise and visibility, namely, the need to communicate to their constituencies the library’s potential as a resource in areas in which the library has not, traditionally, played a strong role.</p>
<p>Librarians at Stony Brook University and elsewhere have used diverse strategies to engage with digital humanities scholars and to build community. For two years librarians at Stony Brook University Libraries have hosted biannual Open Mic events for digital humanities researchers, teachers, and students on campus. Inspired by a desire to better serve digital humanists with existing projects, these events were designed as a platform to connect scholars and students with nascent projects to library-supported and open access resources, and to one another. For the Libraries, each Open Mic was an opportunity to understand the scope and practices of the digital humanities community at Stony Brook, and to identify ways to make meaningful interventions.</p>
<p>The Open Mic events were scheduled during daytime hours in the SBU Libraries Center for Scholarly Communication, a flexible, presentation technology-equipped space seating 28. The first Digital Humanities Open Mic event was held on March 5, 2016. In developing the event, the librarians organizing it began by reaching out to Stony Brook University faculty known to be interested or engaged in digital humanities activities and scholarship. The digital humanities at Stony Brook University is a community without an institutional center, so identifying likely event participants was an opportunity for the organizers to “sound the murky depths” and map the rough shape and range of the digital humanities at Stony Brook University, while discovering the individuals situated in that space by interest, practice or scholarship. There was a three-pronged call to participate or attend: Direct invitation to a selection of known digital humanities researchers; an open invitation broadcast to the myriad humanities departments and programs; and promotion, open invitation on the library website.</p>
<p>Five digital humanities researchers were identified and invited. Though none of them were able to attend the event they all expressed interest in attending future events. Two of them took the invitation as an opportunity to schedule meetings with the event organizers and discuss library support for their work. One discussion led to a collaboration between the researcher and the event organizers and other librarians on a grant application for funding a digital humanities project. The other discussion resulted in the development of a course-integrated library workshop for the other researcher on digital humanities resources and technologies.</p>
<p>The open invitation included an online sign-up form for both attendance and presentation. Three sign-ups were collected, one for attendance and two for presentation. Those two presentations combined with three presentations from librarians were the makings of an hour-long event. Though the event organizers were uncertain of who would attend besides the participants and a small number of librarians and library staff, they were confident that the open mic would bring a spotlight to digital humanities and introduce to the SBU digital humanities community the library as an active, engaged member.</p>
<p>Though one of the scheduled presenters was a no-show, the other presentations each went longer than 10 minutes and were further extended by discussion and questions from the audience. In the end, three presentations (see Appendix 1) were made and the event went slightly overtime. The presentations all included demonstrations of ongoing projects using different technologies and offering different features and experiences for students and researchers, and represented diverse disciplines and wide-ranging materials and content. Considering the diversity of the presentations and the different disciplines they represented, the event was an effective introduction to the complex, interdisciplinary and far-ranging qualities of digital humanities.</p>
<p>The impact of the first Digital Humanities Open Mic can be assessed through a few lenses, including the contacts made with the researchers who were unable to attend but nevertheless welcomed the invitation as beginning of collaborations with the library. Following the first successful open mic event, the University Libraries organized a second event to appeal to scholars who may not have been able to attend the first one, or whose work had progressed in the interim. Several researchers working in the digital humanities had contacted the event organizers, and the level of interest was sufficient to support the creation of a second open mic event. Additionally, the notion of continuity was particularly important as it emphasized the role of the Libraries as partner and consultant in the work of digital humanities at Stony Brook University. The organizers employed the same publicity strategies as for the first Open Mic, with the advantage of nascent name recognition for the event among the digital humanities community at Stony Brook University.</p>
<p>The second Digital Humanities Open Mic event was held at Stony Brook University on October 31, 2016. In marked contrast to the spring session, this Open Mic attracted a number of participants who were new to the digital humanities, along with a few who had active projects. One attendee brought the technical, empirical perspective of a researcher trained in data visualization methods outside of the context of the digital humanities. The diversity of this event was unforeseen because, as with the first Open Mic, participants were not universally screened or queried in advance. Prior to starting the Open Mic, the authors spoke informally with several participants and got a sense of their needs, interests, and motivations.</p>
<p>It became readily apparent that the participants were interested in learning more about the digital humanities through a general discussion, before turning to project presentations. Moderated by the organizers, this conversation helped to tease out the salient points of the digital humanities as a diverse group of practices, inquiries, and research priorities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kirschenbaum2012"> [kirschenbaum2012] </a>. Participants asked questions and demonstrated particular interest in the ways in which digital projects and practices can inform more traditional modes of research in the humanities and social sciences. This prelude was also an opportunity to link the Open Mic to the work of other groups on campus, notably the Stony Brook University Geospatial Center, which offers training in GIS technologies.</p>
<p>Following the group discussion, several scholars presented projects and technologies as part of their work in digital humanities. This group combined faculty librarians and graduate students, none of whom had presented at the previous event. As had been the case the previous spring, the presentations often exceeded the 10-minute lightning talk format. However, the template of a presentation followed by discussion was altered to a more productive format, in which attendees interacted with presenters to produce a joint presentation much more conducive to feedback and enrichment. Because of the diversity of the audience, presenters received feedback from a variety of perspectives concerning new directions for their work. The informality of the open mic format permits continual re-stagings and re-interpretations of these events in ways that can be crafted to suit the needs of the digital humanities community at Stony Brook University. This was particularly true of the second open mic event, which relied less on presenter expertise and more closely followed the format of an introduction to digital humanities priorities and methodologies.</p>
<p>Building on the success of the first event, the second Digital Humanities Open Mic increased the visibility of the University Libraries among digital humanities researchers at Stony Brook University. Additionally, the second event attracted much greater attendance from library faculty and staff, many of whom were encountering the digital humanities as beginners. Though originally conceived of as an outreach tool for non-library faculty, staff, and students, the Open Mic events yielded the added benefit of raising the profile of the digital humanities within the Stony Brook University Libraries as well.</p>
<p>Informed by the experience of prior Digital Humanities Open Mic events at Stony Brook University, the organizers elected to construct the third event in our series following the same model as the first two. Rather than attempt to impose a stricter format, we prefer to encourage open mic attendees and participants to guide us in producing the event which is most useful to them. By understanding that our researchers, teachers, and students work along a broad spectrum of experience and comfort level with regard to the digital humanities, we equip ourselves to better support them as they expand their research in this field.</p>
<p>The third Open Mic event was held on November 13, 2017. As with the previous events, the third Open Mic was deliberately casual in order to foster discussion and relaxed participation. Attendance was lower than the first two events, however, the presence of an undergraduate was a welcomed development, and an indication that interest in and curiosity about digital humanities is coalescing around the Open Mic events. There was a stimulating balance of presentation and engaged discussion that in some ways delivered on our original expectations when developing the Open Mic events.</p>
<p>Each Open Mic event has had its own distinct character, shaped in part by the style, subject and content of the presentations, and perhaps even more by the participation, questions and interests of the audience. The ultimate success of each of these events can be measured in the subsequent requests for consultation and instruction which demonstrate the fact that the Open Mic events raised the visibility of the Libraries as a source of digital humanities expertise on campus, and that they helped to condition the kinds of services and programs offered to meet and expand current needs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Why is the library uniquely situated to offer these services? The interdisciplinarity of the library and the flexibility of its services, spaces, and collections conditions its responsiveness to the needs of diverse stakeholders within the digital humanities community. The library’s role in teaching information literacy through instruction sessions, workshops, and consultations dovetails with the need to communicate digital humanities practices to students learning to incorporate them into their research process. The library is uniquely suited to do this because it exists outside of the student’s department in a way which allows it to support research and scholarly inquiry removed from the constraints of disciplinary convention. Likewise, the library’s flexibility regarding the communication of information — seen in research guides, tutorials, videos, and more traditional forms of scholarship — positions it well to work with students who are interested in disseminating their scholarship through the multimodal methods offered by and through digital humanities practices. Finally, by engaging students working in the digital humanities, the library has an opportunity to serve its mission of contributing to students’ intellectual and professional development in a way which is consistent with its broader goal of promoting critical engagement with information.</p>
<p>Researchers benefit from the library’s digital humanities services and support through access to collections curated in order to facilitate technological engagement, as well as equipment and consultations intended to assist in the integration of digital humanities practices into their scholarship and pedagogy. This is an important opportunity for the library to engage with digital teaching practices. Additionally, the library’s increasing participation in all aspects of the research lifecycle positions it perfectly to help scholars to blend their digital humanities work with their broader research project. Finally, the library’s programming mission provides a forum for researchers to share their work with an interdisciplinary community outside of departmental boundaries.</p>
<p>The creation of a robust menu of services, responsive collections, and flexible spaces in support of the digital humanities is enriching for both the library and librarians. The digital humanities provides an opportunity to conceptualize library collections in innovative ways and to tailor library instruction and consultations to this multifaceted field. As a component of librarian professional development, digital humanities work encompasses several key competencies, including digital practices and tools, collection strategy, project management, academic engagement, and event planning. The diversity of librarians’ training, academic backgrounds, and professional interests pair well with the acquisition of digital humanities expertise, enriching the practice of a fundamentally interdisciplinary, intersectional, and multimodal field of scholarly inquiry. Resource-light, iterative programming, such as the Open Mic events, allow the library to identify digital humanities practitioners and to create a community of shared interest capable of serving the needs of students, faculty, and librarians.</p>

<p>At LibriVox.org there are eight different audiobook versions of Lucy Maud Montgomery’s <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> , all created by volunteers for LibriVox’s public domain audiobook collection. The most recent of these versions was begun and completed in 2016 — not in response to any great need for another free digital audio version of the book, but explicitly because such a well-loved story was seen as an unintimidating and fun way for those less familiar with LibriVox to engage and become more familiar with the community’s audiobook-making processes. Another children’s classic, <em>Little Women</em> , was also being re-recorded in its fourth version that summer, and veteran volunteers like MaryAnnSpiegel<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> , who coordinated the 2016 <em>Anne</em> , recognized the popularity of these works as potentially useful gateways through which newer LibriVox volunteers could learn and engage with the production processes of the LibriVox audiobook project<a class="footnote-ref" href="#spiegel2016"> [spiegel2016] </a>.</p>
<p>LibriVox workflows have developed in an ad hoc manner, across multiple online and offline spaces, negotiated by volunteers who were learning together how best to support and steward this open digital project. Built upon the affordances provided by new models of collaborative production<a class="footnote-ref" href="#howe2006"> [howe2006] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#howe2008"> [howe2008] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#shirky2010"> [shirky2010] </a>and the increasing availability and accessibility of digital tools and platforms, the LibriVox project invites any willing volunteers to join in their mission “To make all books in the public domain available, for free, in audio format on the internet” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#librivoxnd"> [librivoxnd] </a>. LibriVox productions are most often deeply collaborative, with several readers recording smaller sections of a text. All languages, accents, and reading styles are welcome, and anyone willing to propose, manage, and complete an audiobook project is encouraged to contribute. Aside from an insistence on public domain content recorded in standard, accessible file formats, there are no firm rules about how volunteers perform this work. LibriVox volunteers operate collaboratively, but independently, without institutional sponsorship and without much official direction or management beyond their own transient, global, online community of practice. However, there is a need for consistency and some degree of shared policy in coordinating the contributions of thousands of diverse volunteers. Volunteers must find ways to reliably coordinate the labor not only of recording and distributing audiobooks, but also the labor of developing, documenting, and maintaining a set of “standard,” inviting production processes, while also allowing the project to remain open, flexible, and relatively convenient for current and prospective members. The dual priorities of maintaining an open, inviting community while also aiming for clear, accessible, and consistently high-quality recordings from all volunteers can occasionally seem at odds. Each volunteer confronts and negotiates her own sense of balance within that tension, and along the way, subtly reinforces or undermines the current status quo within the wider project. Within such a context of production, where individuals from diverse cultures are encouraged to contribute as much or as little as their time and interests allow, how do LibriVox volunteers (collaboratively and individually) navigate the technical, sociocultural, and material contexts in which their audio recording and editing work takes place?</p>
<p>By tracing the digital publishing history of LibriVox and examining how its volunteers have managed and negotiated procedures and policies for their ongoing collaborative work, I begin to make visible the intricate, unique, archived experiences of these volunteer digital humanists, while acknowledging that there are myriad ways in which volunteers’ efforts — whether with LibriVox or any other public digital humanities endeavor — can never fully be accessed or quantified. In what follows, I situate LibriVox as a valuable digital humanities project and argue for more scholarly recognition of and engagement with public, volunteer digital humanities projects. I ask that we consider what digital humanities work can and does look like outside of the constraints and affordances of institutional or scholarly sponsorship.</p>
<p>Examining LibriVox, its history, and its modes of collaboration more closely allows us to begin to understand the evolving workflows of this public, open digitization work and to make visible the work that has helped support thirteen years of functional, productive, and sustained collaboration across cultures, languages, platforms, and media. Often the work of organizing, networking, planning, meta-writing, negotiating change, accommodating new members, moderating disputes, and other behind-the-scenes work that is often a part of complex digital humanities projects can be erased or made less visible. Such foundational, behind-the-scenes work can easily blend into the shapes of larger tasks that leave deeper, more obvious traces. As Star and Strauss (1999) discuss, what is “counted” as work may be marked by a “gamut of indicators” — physical, social, legal, and so on, and “All along this continuum, the visibility and legitimacy of work can never be taken for granted” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#star1999"> [star1999] </a>. Impressive finished projects can easily eclipse the smaller, more thinly-spread negotiations and interpersonal work taken on by multiple volunteers across weeks or months or years. Circumstances of material or social privilege can also very easily be overlooked, made invisible by the assumptions we make about the supposedly egalitarian nature of digital technology and distributed, networked communities. Only in retracing the archived conversations of the LibriVox community can the extent of volunteers’ collaborative thinking, rethinking, and working be made more consistently visible.</p>
<p>Drawing on an ethnographic study of 12 years of archived discourse and documentation, I interrogate digital traces of the processes by which several LibriVox versions of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> have come into being, watching for ways in which policies and infrastructure have been influenced by variously visible and invisible volunteer efforts. Recognizing the value of this interpersonal, tenuously connected, volunteer-supported work within the context of LibriVox will allow us to more readily appreciate — and potentially support and reward — such work in other arenas. I recognize LibriVox and other social spaces of production (Project Gutenberg, the Internet Archive, WikiSource, or Goodreads, for example) as sites of legitimate labor, not in order to claim that such labor requires monetary compensation, nor that it should necessarily be granted any of the recognition we tend to assign to work in a traditional sense, but in order to showcase the significance and impact of such work, and to begin thinking about more inclusive and intersectional ways of valuing public, amateur contributions to the digital humanities.</p>
<h2 id="a-global-digital-audiobook-picnic">A Global, Digital Audiobook Picnic</h2>
<p>Many recent discussions of public, crowdsourced instances of digital humanities production follow institutionally-sponsored projects seeking volunteers to help complete especially laborious tasks such as tagging, transcribing, or proofreading<a class="footnote-ref" href="#causer2012"> [causer2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#manzo2015"> [manzo2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#bilansky2015"> [bilansky2015] </a>. In contrast to these types of projects, LibriVox has always employed an entirely volunteer-driven model of production, and its processes and output are much more open. Any volunteer can join the project, regardless of expertise or language background, and any internet-connected listener can access and use the audiobooks that volunteers produced.</p>
<p>As a crowdsourcing endeavor without institutional sponsorship and without commercial incentive, the LibriVox project falls into a model that Shirky (2010) describes as neither public (the way most roads are funded), nor private (the way most cars are produced), but social — or “how most picnics happen” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#shirky2010"> [shirky2010] </a>. In the social sector, groups or communities create value among themselves, primarily for themselves or likeminded others, following their own norms and guidelines without direct pressure from any outside economic or political interests. Within the strict legal boundaries of the US public domain, LibriVox volunteers otherwise have the freedom to determine their own policies and workflows amongst themselves. Five fundamental principles frame the project’s mission and practices:<br>
Librivox is a non-commercial, non-profit and ad-free projectLibrivox donates its recordings to the public domainLibrivox is powered by volunteersLibrivox maintains a loose and open structureLibrivox welcomes all volunteers from across the globe, in all languages<a class="footnote-ref" href="#librivoxnd"> [librivoxnd] </a></p>
<p>Because all LibriVox audio editions are donated back into the public domain, others are free to do whatever they like with them, whether for personal, educational, or commercial purposes. Thus, in the case of LibriVox, value produced within the group is also shared with non-members, who are welcome to share and distribute that work further.</p>
<p>The LibriVox catalog currently includes more than 12,500 audiobooks, read in more than 90 different languages.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Any previously published text free of copyright restrictions is eligible for inclusion; volunteers have recorded novels, plays, poetry, cookbooks, textbooks, and government documents. Included among these are versions of well-known stories like <em>Beowulf</em> and <em>Hamlet</em> , as well as many other more obscure texts that commercial publishers would have very little incentive to reproduce. Monetary incentives and financial profit are not the primary values driving community-based production models — the novelty of participating, the social capital or ethos gained through providing service, and personal enjoyment of the activity can be equally powerful motivations. Because LibriVox functions so separately from commercial frames of value and production, its production model and history are particularly valuable examples of distributed, decentralized, extra-institutional work.</p>
<p>Though LibriVox volunteers, for the most part, do not act as scholars, nor as paid professionals or experts, their work does count as digital preservation, as humanities work, and as generous public service. The work of finding, selecting, and preparing texts to be digitized and published in audio form can be complex and slow. According to the needs of each project, LibriVox volunteers may perform the labor of curators, copyright sleuths, digital content managers, voice artists, project managers, mentors and instructors, researchers, translators, audio producers, and technical writers. Not all of this volunteer labor ultimately remains visible (or audible) to those who download and listen to finished LibriVox audiobooks, nor is it even visible to all volunteers.</p>

<p>LibriVox will celebrate fourteen years of existence on August 10, 2019. In the time since its founding, the Librivox project has grown and shifted in response to new technological developments and as a result of volunteers’ changing levels of engagement and literacy with regard to what LibriVox is about. As LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire reflected in a 2007 blogpost, “the whole thing — the system — evolved like an organism, getting more complex in response to environmental challenges. More readers, more books, more languages, more projects required a slow evolution of a management” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcguire2007"> [mcguire2007] </a>. Audio recording practices, project management practices, and digital cataloging procedures at LibriVox have evolved under the influence of past practices. Community norms and standards have been shaped by small, ad hoc, or makeshift decisions influenced by the material circumstances, constraints, and affordances of the project’s context overall and various volunteers’ contexts individually. Some of this growth and evolution is recorded and visible in the archived digital artifacts of the community. Some, however, is more hidden, or has been lost, ultimately making a full recovery of LibriVox’s distributed history impossible.</p>
<p>Taking an ethnographic approach to the LibriVox project<a class="footnote-ref" href="#boellstorff2012"> [boellstorff2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#hine2015"> [hine2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#adams2016"> [adams2016] </a>, I have observed and participated in the processes required for making free, public domain audio. Immersing myself in LibriVox processes has been crucial for learning more about the experience, norms, and nuances of the community. As I have observed the community and “learned-by-doing” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hine2015"> [hine2015] </a>, I have also followed Catherine Adams and Terrie Lynn Thompson (2016) in attending to and “interviewing” digital artifacts, interfaces, practices, and micropractices by “listening to things, observing them in action, discerning their co-constitutive influences, as well as relations with other entities and beings around them” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#adams2016"> [adams2016] </a>. Attending to aspects of intertextuality and interactivity among various LibriVox participants, online spaces, and other artifacts, particularly those records gathered by the catalog database, website, and LibriVox forums, has helped me to reconstitute and triangulate details from the history of LibriVox’s ongoing production and documentation work.</p>
<p>LibriVox volunteers share and manage their recording and editing work in generous, flexible, and sometimes idiosyncratic ways. They adopt and adapt various applications, platforms, hardware, software, and multimodal file formats as needed, requesting help and offering tutorials and advice in the LibriVox forums along the way. No two volunteers will have the same recording space or environment, nor will they follow the same processes exactly. While many volunteers use the open source recording software Audacity, others have found and continue to find their own ways to contribute using other platforms, tools, and processes.</p>
<p>My research has involved clearly articulating and representing the activities of LibriVox volunteers as I retrace and untangle their past and present practices. Using what evidence that remains of those practices, I must “inventively reconstruct anecdotes from a variety of sources in order to provide a more co-constitutive account of humans thinking, dwelling, and building with and through their nonhuman surround” and “gather observational threads and interview snippets, then carefully weave human and nonhuman storylines back together” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#adams2016"> [adams2016] </a>. Importantly, this postmodern methodology “means letting a thing retain its silence” even “while gently coaxing it into the light, giving it time and space to speak so that we might take notice” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#adams2016"> [adams2016] </a>. The iterative process of coaxing LibriVox artifacts into the light has involved tracing and retracing my steps through the digital archives of this idiosyncratic community, cross referencing dates and events that have been partially documented across forum posts (see Figure 1), podcast episodes, website updates, and catalog pages (see Figure 2).</p>

<p>The eight LibriVox versions of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> serve as useful touchstones for this article’s exploration because their production has spanned a wide range of LibriVox history (2005–2016) and a range of project types (collaborative, individual, and one dramatic performance). Together, all eight versions include contributions from 51 individual volunteer readers, coordinators, and proof listeners who are part of a broad, global contingent of LibriVox members. By reviewing this range of audio production cases, I begin to uncover, recover, trace, and retrace what evidence is and is not left behind by volunteers as they contribute to the living archive of project documentation and public digitization work of LibriVox.</p>
<p>Table 1 organizes evidence and theories as to the structure and infrastructure of each <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> project, with details drawn primarily from the original project threads for each version. These project threads typically include a record of the volunteers who coordinated and completed each project, instructions for collaborators, links to the original e-text and to audio files in progress, and a series of back-and-forth updates and conversations about each version’s progress over time. LibriVox’s public forums help to preserve the shared knowledge and interactions of volunteers, old and new, over time.<br>

Though all eight versions, according to their catalog listings, appear to have been based on the same public domain source text — one digitized for Project Gutenberg by David Widger and Charles Keller in 1992<a class="footnote-ref" href="#montgomery1992"> [montgomery1992] </a>— the reader for Version 4 seems to have read directly from a printed and bound copy. The sounds of pages turning leave audible traces in her recordings. In her case, the catalog’s link to Project Gutenberg’s e-text could be a convenient shorthand, seeming to overwrite the true provenance of her performance. This instance in which the true embodied practice of an individual LibriVox volunteer is hidden behind a screen of metadata, presumed policy, or other project management convention, is one among many. Conversely, there are also examples where community policies and conventions are superseded by the specific needs or constraints of a volunteers’ material situation. Inconsistencies are prevalent across many of the very first items cataloged. Only later in LibriVox’s development were readers regularly given instruction to read from a specific digital text and only that text. Even still, knowing precisely which text (or in which format, browser, or type of screen) an individual reader read from in every particular case would be a difficult matter to ascertain.</p>
<h2 id="incarnations-of-anne-of-green-gables-at-librivox-invisible-chronologies">Incarnations of Anne of Green Gables at LibriVox: In/Visible Chronologies</h2>
<p>Following my survey of all eight versions, I conducted a more detailed review of four particular <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> versions, noting specific changes in file storage and retrieval, recording protocol for all audio sections, and other behind-the-scenes elements of LibriVox work. Each of these projects has left behind time-stamped traces of both the individual and the collective efforts involved in transforming alphabetic texts into accessible audio content. Some of these traces, in combination with others scattered around the LibriVox forums, reveal particularly interesting shifts in LibriVox’s collaboratively-built digital infrastructure, procedures, and policies. Some traces are much less scrutable, highlighting unpredictable contrasts between visible and invisible work.<br>
The very first version (2005–2006) has left prominent traces of the highly transient, decentralized nature of LibriVox’s early infrastructure. Works-in-progress were temporarily hosted on third-party file storage sites or donated server space.Over the two-year period (2006-2008) during which Annie Coleman worked on Version 4 of Anne of Green Gables, her solo project absorbed several changes in the policies and procedures of the still-evolving LibriVox community.A multitude of voices and volunteers came together for the most labor-intensive version of the text — the dramatic reading, completed in 2011. The individuals and voices present and not present in the project thread compared to those present (and not present) in the finished catalog entry for this version illustrate core LibriVox principles of openness, patience, and flexibility.Anne of Green Gables Version 6 (originally mis-cataloged as Version 5) was actually completed 3 years after what is currently labeled in the catalog as Version 7. Such quirks and inconsistencies in metadata and content management highlight deep complexities within the catalog’s database infrastructure and its management/re-management over time.</p>
<p>Through these example cases, I observe that LibriVox’s emergent, community-made procedures variously accommodate and at times resist the changing expectations of the project’s volunteers and its outside audiences.</p>
<h2 id="20052006-scattered-seeds-of-digital-infrastructure">2005–2006: Scattered Seeds of Digital Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The enthusiastic book coordinator, thistlechick (Betsie Bush), who opened the very first collaborative <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> project for LibriVox had been a member for only a week when, in December of 2005, she began inviting contributions to this collaborative reading. LibriVox was roughly four months old at this stage, and much of its infrastructure had yet to be built. That month, the number of active volunteers fell just short of 200, and only a dozen audiobooks had been completed<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mowatt2007"> [mowatt2007] </a>. Standard technical specifications for audio files had not yet been finalized, and discussions about creating a searchable, database-driven catalog were still slowly progressing.</p>
<p>LibriVox’s early growth and development into an online community and eventually an extensive global collaboration align with Wenger, White, and Smith’s observations about communities of practice: “Unlike the trajectory of a team that’s planned from the start, communities unfold over time without a predefined ending point. Communities often start tentatively, with only an initial sense of why they should come together and with modest technology resources” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#wenger2009"> [wenger2009] </a>. The beginnings of LibriVox were tentative, but also bold. Volunteers gathered first to a simple blog, then to forums, making do with whatever other digital platforms and tools they found useful. Several coordinators donated their own server space as temporary storage for the audio files of projects-in-process, and others used third-party file transfer sites such as <em>yousendit.com</em> or <em>megaupload.com</em> . Hyperlinks to these temporary sites of storage are still present, but broken, in this and many other early LibriVox project threads. Though no longer useable as paths to the works-in-progress they once were, they leave traces that evidence volunteers’ generosity, savvy, and resourcefulness in the early days of LibriVox. The ability and willingness to share/donate personal resources (such as time and server space) and the technical savvy to do so were important factors in helping LibriVox grow and settle into the robust volunteer space it has ultimately become.</p>
<p>The practice of relying on temporary file storage, whether from third-party sites or from generous volunteers with their own server space, continued for several months. It wasn’t until nearly two years later when LibriVox could claim its own central server space (also maintained via donation, and also meant to be temporary — all finished audiobooks are hosted more permanently at <em>archive.org</em> ). Even still, to some extent, the transient nature of works-in-progress at LibriVox persists. Completed projects at LibriVox still bear consistent marks of a transience, since even the central LibriVox file storage space is continually overwritten with new works-in-progress as previous works are finished and moved to their final catalog spaces. Evidence of this in-between labor is not meant to last, but does leave behind traces of past infrastructure (or lack thereof) and infrastructural development. As the LibriVox project has become more established and developed more standardized, centralized procedures, its community has also become more accessible to volunteers who may lack the same levels of technical expertise that early volunteers were more likely to need.</p>
<p>As this first <em>Anne</em> project drew to a close, LibriVox volunteers had begun discussing whether it would be worthwhile to enforce a “prooflistening” stage for all LibriVox submissions. After much debate about whether the extra effort and potential for inviting criticism<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chesley2018b"> [chesley2018b] </a>would prove too discouraging to future volunteers, the practice was gradually adopted and eventually instituted as routine. By the time the next version of <em>Anne</em> was begun, in August 2006, prooflistening had become fairly standard for all LibriVox works.</p>
<h2 id="20062008-negotiating-and-enacting-librivox-policies">2006–2008: Negotiating and Enacting LibriVox Policies</h2>
<p>The institution of the new practice of prooflistening was not the only instance of LibriVox policies changing in response to volunteers’ discussion and debate. During the two years that LibaryLady (Annie Coleman Rothenberg) spent gradually recording what would become Version 4 of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> , another small but significant change was successfully argued for and implemented — one that would subtly mark her solo rendition of the text.</p>
<p>As a crucial marker of their public domain status and their origin from within the LibriVox project, all LibriVox recordings begin with an introductory disclaimer and invitation to listeners:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a LibriVox recording. All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain. For more information or to volunteer, please visit librivox.org.<br>
This official disclaimer has remained fundamentally the same in wording and in length since the beginning of LibriVox, despite occasional attempts to shorten it. During LibriVox’s earliest years, readers customarily pronounced the standard disclaimer first before specifying the title, author, and chapter details of the section they were recording. And so it continued until in December 2006, roughly four months after LibraryLady began her version of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> , another volunteer related the following in a new thread in the “Suggestions, Comments, News, &amp; Discussion” forum at LibriVox:<br>
As I&rsquo;m listening to my iPod Shuffle (admittedly, with no screen) with shuffling switched off, iit [sic] takes a full 30 seconds to find out what track I am on. It would be helpful if we could say right away,Chapter 30 of Mark Twain&rsquo;s Innocents Abroad. This is a LibriVox recording, etc., etc. &hellip;That way those without screens (and there are many at the screenless Shuffle level, especially in schools and school libraries) can quickly know where they are.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sayers2006"> [sayers2006] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the sake of those without immediate visual access to the list of chapters or sections on a display screen, LibriVox volunteers determined together to modify the order of chapter/section numbers and the introductory disclaimer. New projects, from that time forward, would no longer begin immediately with “This is a LibriVox recording…” , but would instead first note the section or chapter number of the text being recorded. Volunteer coordinators and admins adopted this policy change gradually over the next months, modifying instructional documentation along the way.</p>
<p>Only a subtle trace of this change exists in the first few seconds of the finished audio files of LibaryLady’s <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> . The first 22 chapters, recorded between August 2006 and March 2007, begin directly with “This is a LibriVox recording,” according to the older, original LibriVox convention. The very next chapter gives listeners the updated, more informative introduction, with “Chapter 23 of Anne of Green Gables” first, and “This is a LibriVox recording…” next. The remaining fifteen chapters of the book all follow this new pattern. The audible evidence of this collaborative decision about recording protocol manifests only as a sudden, easily missed change between adjacent chapters. In response to a volunteer sharing their listening experience, the LibriVox community accepted and shared the discursive labor of negotiating this change, of shifting their established recording habits, and of updating documentation across the LibriVox community to represent the change in policy.</p>
<h2 id="20102011-adapting-_anne-of-green-gables_">2010–2011: Adapting <em>Anne of Green Gables</em></h2>
<p>The planning, preparation, recording, and editing of a dramatic reading entails extensive work. For the dramatic reading version of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> , coordinator wildemoose (Arielle Lipshaw) estimated it might take a full year to complete the project. The reading would need volunteers for twenty-four distinct speaking roles, including Anne herself as Narrator. In reality, several more than twenty-four volunteer readers professed interest in joining this project, posted claims for specific roles in the project thread. Yet not all of them are ultimately credited in the catalog as collaborators.</p>
<p>Because LibriVox maintains a volunteer-driven, loose and open structure, contributors may perform come and go from the project, dedicating as much or as little effort as they wish. Volunteer LibriVox coordinators do not require previous audio recording experience and do not necessarily expect any lasting commitment. When sections or roles in a project are claimed but not completed within a reasonable time (determined by the project’s coordinators), the convention at LibriVox is to “orphan” those sections and open them up for other volunteers to take on. Orphaned sections are common; all four of these collaborative <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> project threads contain comments about or other evidence of orphaned sections.</p>
<p>In the case of this dramatic reading, seven volunteers, most of them brand new to the LibriVox forums, arrived in the project thread to claim roles in the dramatic reading. Then — for reasons that now remain largely invisible and unknown — these individuals never completed their planned contributions. One would-be reader for the project, AmateurOzmologist (Miriam Esther Goldman) did submit two chapters’ worth of Mrs. Rachel Lynde’s lines, but disappeared from the thread with no public explanation before the project’s end. AmateurOzmologist’s work with this text, because it was incomplete, is entirely absent from and entirely unacknowledged in the finished audiobook.</p>
<p>Volunteers like AmateurOzmologist, who come to a project and get lost from it, whose un/recorded voices or other prospective efforts may ultimately not make it in to the final catalog, are still a part of LibriVox. The community values their willingness to volunteer even if it is only potential, put off until “someday, eventually.” And ideal of loose, open, volunteer-powered project means that the possibility (and apparent risk) of volunteers disappearing as quickly and easily as they arrive at LibriVox, of course, is unavoidable. These realities — where volunteer relationships and connections are tentative, easily breakable, and often lost — are part of the inviting, practical modularity of LibriVox. In response, the general attitude at LibriVox is one of understanding, tolerance, and patience. To tolerate so readily the apparent “failure” of seemingly earnest volunteers may seem something of a burden to the volunteers who do complete their work in good time. But part of LibriVox’s loose and open structure involves making space for those invisible, not-yet contributions from potential members of the project. Perhaps if they are too busy this time, they will come back to volunteer next year, or the year after that. Overall, volunteers have responded to the project’s open flexibility with an impressive number of volunteer hours, the true quantity of which is only hinted at by the cumulative recorded run time of the entire LibriVox catalog.</p>
<h2 id="2013-a-time-traveling-anne-and-the-impact-of-major-catalog-upgrades">2013: A Time-Traveling Anne and the Impact of Major Catalog Upgrades</h2>
<p>When WoollyBee (Sarah Parshall) began recording what later came to be labeled as <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> Version 6, she was brand new to LibriVox and especially enthusiastic about recording this children’s classic with which she strongly identified. The project took her about six months to complete and was cataloged in July of 2013. This date places WoollyBee’s solo chronologically between Version 7 (the dramatic reading completed in 2010, discussed above) and Version 8 (the most recent collaborative reading, completed in 2016). The reasons for the oddly anachronistic tagging of both the solo recording and the dramatic reading are not fully made clear in any LibriVox records I investigated, but the issue is likely tied to the major catalog update that took place during the summer of 2013. That August, the final stages of an in-depth, year-long overhaul of the LibriVox databases, workflow tools, and infrastructure were implemented<a class="footnote-ref" href="#librivox2012a"> [librivox2012a] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#librivox2012b"> [librivox2012b] </a>. Handfuls of error reports related to this crossover from old system to new were posted in the LibriVox forums during the first half of August 2013, including one from Woolly Bee herself concerning an apparent error with her finished <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> . Hers and most other reports during this period are answered with confident encouragement from administrators that the issues would be fixed as soon as the new catalog system was fully functional. The website and database infrastructure behind LibriVox, in combination with the distributed, ad hoc volunteer community that work within that infrastructure, are complex enough that quirks and inconsistencies in metadata like those noted here have likely accumulated in several other corners of the project.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this project, WoollyBee correctly cites it as the “seventh version” of Anne of Green Gables. She also recalls the catalog updates of 2013, and their overall impact on LibriVox, positively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most notable physical change that I’ve seen happen to LV during the time I have been volunteering here is definitely the huge update that happened maybe 3, 4 years ago. Once everything was updated there was definitely a huge learning curve, but I like our new system so much more. It’s so much easier to be a book coordinator now… it’s just a much better system all around.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chesley2018a"> [chesley2018a] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more we have an instance where volunteers’ labor — that of WoollyBee and the coordinators who worked on her <em>Anne</em> solo, and that of the volunteers who guided LibriVox through the upgrades and redesign process — are only visible in partial traces. WoollyBee hints at the work of re-learning how to coordinate LibriVox projects in the aftermath of the redesign. While a handful of forum announcements and blog posts communicate some of the labor involved in the update, including planned server outages, status updates, and a report of hours spent<a class="footnote-ref" href="#librivox2012a"> [librivox2012a] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#librivox2012b"> [librivox2012b] </a>, the full scope of individual and collective efforts to accommodate the change are not made completely transparent to the public.</p>
<p>As this case illustrates, public digital humanities projects have the potential to outgrow their tentative beginnings enough to warrant drastic changes in infrastructure and procedures. Whether that change emerges from within or is imposed from without, it will require flexible, patient human cooperation. The work of evaluating, building, and implementing new technologies and the work of accommodating fellow volunteers to that new technology are both important. The agility to navigate (and help others to navigate) ongoing technical and infrastructural change are crucial for supporting a sustainable, persistent digital humanities project. Fitzpatrick (2017) offers a comforting reminder in this vein, asserting that “Real sustainability, after all, isn’t just about revenue generation and cost recovery. It’s about relationships, about personal and institutional commitment, about the willingness to work together toward long-term means of ensuring that the platforms we build today will not just survive but evolve with our technologies and the people who use them” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#fitzpatrick2017"> [fitzpatrick2017] </a>. As volunteers and their many tools join and contribute to the LibriVox system, the infrastructure they use will also continue to evolve.</p>
<h2 id="stewarding-technology-stewarding-community">Stewarding Technology, Stewarding Community</h2>
<p>Through all of these <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> projects, relationships among human volunteers, digital technologies, interfaces, texts, recording hardware, software, and other tools intertwine and build upon each other. The time and effort volunteers donate to LibriVox, whether regularly or sporadically or somewhere in between, not only supports and maintains the project’s infrastructure, but becomes part of that infrastructure itself, working towards reinforcing (and at times contradicting) the purposes and practices that bring volunteers together.</p>
<p>In a global, digitally-distributed volunteer community, public and accessible instruction is crucial for the longevity of the project, and for attracting and training new participants. LibriVox’s archived technical documentation, however partial, contingent, or informally distributed among the project’s members, all plays a crucial role in shaping, managing, expanding, and sustaining this community of diverse and sometimes transient volunteers. Volunteers, their hardware and software tools, their forum posts, and their interactions all contribute to the stewardship and maintenance of LibriVox as a productive project and a welcoming digital community.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of what they call “technology stewardship,” Wenger, White, and Smith (2009) define the role of technology steward as one that emerges as “a natural outcome of taking care of a community that’s using technology to learn together” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#wenger2009"> [wenger2009] </a>. They go on add that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… in many cases, technology stewardship is a critical part of community leadership, facilitating a community’s emergence or growth. It becomes a very creative practice that evolves along with the community and reflects the community’s self-design — the process by which a community designs itself as a vehicle for learning, which includes use of technology.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wenger2009"> [wenger2009] </a><br>
As individuals learn and build themselves into the LibriVox project, they take on roles as technology stewards, contingent team leaders, just-in-time facilitators, teachers, or mentors. Their various and combined efforts help the project to expand and continue to “design itself” along the way. In some cases, as we saw with the discussion about re-ordering the LibriVox disclaimer, a single person’s observation about the potential needs of a group can eventually scaffold a whole new set of protocols. As volunteer Cori observed in a 2012 LibriVox forum discussion, “everything starts because one person thought it was a good idea. LibriVox itself, and all the processes and tasks within it” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#samuel2012"> [samuel2012] </a>. Even if only one volunteer notices and cares that something is done to serve a small subset of the community in a new or different way, their influence can spread and begin to benefit larger sections of the LibriVox project, its audiences, and the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theorizing the sometimes inscrutable decisions and actions of the many participants who contribute to LibriVox is perhaps an unusual undertaking, but valuable as an avenue toward appreciating the everyday digital humanities work that happens as part of our increasingly digitally-mediated lives. Of the possible range of motives shared among LibriVox volunteers, founder Hugh McGuire writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of us are making a stand about public, non-commercial space, about public domain, about the importance of efforts outside the pervasive commercial framework that dominates our world. But some of us are just reading because we like it. This can be political if you wish, or mean nothing more than this: we read books and give the audio files away for free. Both are valid, both are important.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcguire2005"> [mcguire2005] </a><br>
Whether motivated by pure enjoyment, by ideology, or by a mixture of both, LibriVox volunteers are engaged in a particularly open and inclusive project of cultural preservation. However, despite prevailing LibriVox policies that disallow censorship, bowdlerization, and abridgement, an almost invisible degree of macro-censorship is inevitable within the project, driven by what volunteers have so far chosen not to read. Through the results of the choices they make in selecting and producing free audiobooks, volunteers at LibriVox collectively influence what kinds of human culture and knowledge are being collected, digitized, preserved, consumed, and circulated by global audiences. This realization echoes Griffin and Hayler’s (2018) reminder that “DH tools and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode material realities which both pre-exist, and are co-produced by them.” The labor practices behind LibriVox’s ever-expanding audiobook catalog are not neutral, no matter how much LibriVox as a collective might espouse an ideal of impartiality. As is true of much volunteer work, individuals and groups who are most resource-rich, whether in material/monetary terms, education or expertise, or free time, are most likely to engage in and to benefit from such labor<a class="footnote-ref" href="#musick2008"> [musick2008] </a>. Similarly, as Bourg (2018) points out, the risks and benefits of participating in open projects are “unevenly distributed in patterns that match existing systems of oppression” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bourg2018"> [bourg2018] </a>. No matter now democratic or equitable new digital spaces and platforms may seem, we cannot merely assume that all identities or perspectives are being included. Nor can we take for granted that current systems and norms are adequate for supporting and serving the needs of all who might wish to be a part of public digital humanities work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the perspectives and values of the volunteers who are driving these processes will require further critical attention and research. Documenting the full range of motives behind all LibriVox contributions has been beyond the scope of this study, but efforts to do so could add depth to further discussions of public digital humanities work. Future research might also attend more specifically to the reception, circulation, and wider cultural effects of LibriVox audiobooks as another way of accounting for the value of the labor that is producing them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>LibriVox volunteers are digitizing and preserving literature and other texts in audio form in ways that afford near limitless access, re-distribution, and re-use. In retracing the archived conversations of LibriVox and in re-articulating some of the organization’s changes over time, I’ve begun to make more visible the extent of volunteers’ collaborative intellectual, social, and material work. Though their efforts do not necessarily stem from scholarly interest nor have the rigor that more academic digitization projects might require, LibriVox volunteers are engaged in a thoroughly public and thoroughly digital project, making extensive portions of human culture more widely accessible to more humans. As part of this ambitious public domain project, the relatively undirected work of amateurs and volunteers can make small but meaningful differences in how the world’s knowledge and information is preserved and passed down across media and across time. In turn, the kinds of documented culture available will influence the identities and lives of those audiences: the perspectives they are exposed to, the histories they may consume or to contribute to, the educational opportunities they are allowed or able to access, and the creative or economic or vocational decisions they might make.</p>
<p>As we recognize public, volunteer, crowdsourcing projects like LibriVox as established, yet unique, institutions of digital publishing and public digital humanities work, we also are more likely to remember that all institutions were once new, contingent, and shaped by the small decisions of regular humans making things happen as best they could with what was around. Recognizing the digitization and re-mediation work of such digital humanities projects, especially in spaces outside the typical institutions of workplaces and academia, is important in context of our increasingly distributed and decentralized world and the economic transformations that may attend increasing globalization and ongoing technological advancement. Inviting and involving more people into the processes of preserving human culture will mean that more kinds of culture, more perspectives on and from those cultures, and more embodied experiences from across diverse cultures will also be preserved and safeguarded.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-the-visible-work-of-a-dh-lab">Introduction: The Visible Work of a DH Lab</h2>
<p>In <em>The Big Humanities: Digital Humanities/Digital Laboratories</em> , Richard J. Lane discusses a number of types of “humanistic labs, centres, projects, and products,” but he maintains a striking focus on the possibilities of the digital humanities (DH) lab. For Lane, the digital humanities lab provides an opportunity to bring a Big Science research model to the humanities, which includes a shift to “lab-based” knowledge production<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lane2017"> [lane2017] </a>. Everything is larger: the research teams, the data sets, the duration of projects, the funding — evolution, so to speak, of what we might call a “lab ethos” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#lane2017"> [lane2017] </a>. In addition, the construction of <em>Big Humanities</em> as a topic area correlates closely with a shift in philanthropy in higher education, which is “less concerned about creating in-perpetuity funds than solving a large, intractable problem” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#thorp2010"> [thorp2010] </a>. DH funders such as the Mellon Foundation will fund projects for impact, which is viewed as highly interdisciplinary, with high levels of engagement, and market-consciousness<a class="footnote-ref" href="#thorp2010"> [thorp2010] </a>. The more scientific the model and technical the discourse, the more likely STEM funding may also be available<a class="footnote-ref" href="#thornham2017"> [thornham2017] </a>. For this reason, Big Humanities are in great demand, and labs compete for large-scale funding through the constructive and imagineering nature of their grants. Inevitably, the paradigm of funding shapes the kind of work that is done, and the tools and methods that are used.</p>
<p>Of course this is not the only value that institutions see in digital humanities labs. One need only inspect the technologies in a given DH lab to know what kinds of projects in which the lab is participating or able to support. A large, funded project will support the tools and methods needed to get the specific work of that project done. There may even be development of specific packages or software. By contrast, a lab that fits the computing support model will offer a broader range of technologies, tools, and personnel to fit a broad range of DH interests. An example of the former can be found in the humanities college-funded Digital Environmental Humanities Lab at California State University-Northridge, where students under the mentorship of one professor used XMIND software to visualize data related to the creation of the national park system in order to expose the exclusion of people of color in this narrative<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ruiz2017"> [ruiz2017] </a>. An example of the computing support model may be found in the press release issued by Bowling Green State University to announce their Digital Humanities Lab:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The goal of the Digital Humanities Lab is to encourage and support innovative, interdisciplinary research projects that make creative use of technology,” said Colleen Boff, associate dean for University Libraries. “We focus on supporting projects that are enhanced by visualization tools, multimedia applications, and manipulating data acquired through application programming interfaces (API).”<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bowlinggreenstateuniversity2015"> [bowlinggreenstateuniversity2015] </a>The press release then lists the training offerings for faculty and students related to the software that supports these kinds of projects. By comparison, a Big Humanities lab, much like a Principal Investigator&rsquo;s (PI&rsquo;s) scientific laboratory, may not necessarily have tools, methods, or training offerings for a wider academic audience at their institution. The DH lab, then, is fairly well-understood as a mechanism for advancing individual research goals, supporting faculty enrichment, striving for institutional alignment with scientific paradigms for enterprise-level research, as well as a hub for postdoctoral and postgraduate training — even in institutions where it is lacking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, what do we see when we de-emphasize the institutional and faculty aspirations so often associated with DH labs? The relationship between institutional role and research activity operates amidst other dynamics of research variation, and the DH lab is not uniform across it. As Mary Jo Deegan notes, the literature in DH in the United States (she mentions specifically Gold’s edited collections <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> ) tends to be more focused on theory and more focused on the Modern Languages Association and North America, whereas European DH tends to be more project and practice-focused<a class="footnote-ref" href="#deegan2014"> [deegan2014] </a>. The examples of DH labs offered by Claire Warwick tend to be more focused on the practices of large-scale projects<a class="footnote-ref" href="#warwick2012"> [warwick2012] </a>. Postgraduate and postdoctoral students tend to be situated as participants on these projects, who learn from PIs on the job.</p>
<p>In this article, we consider what invisible or less visible work becomes illuminated when practitioners understand the DH lab as a space for prioritizing graduate student needs. Graduate student perspectives may be sufficiently overlooked in the debates of “what,”  “why,” and “who” is the digital humanities, despite the importance of graduate students to most DH teams reliant upon their labor. Thus, this article examines the ways that the DH lab can foster unique experiences for graduate students that fulfill what Alexander Reid postulates as the “central task” of DH — graduate education<a class="footnote-ref" href="#reid2012"> [reid2012] </a>. More specifically, we argue that the DH lab as an institutional economic model does not necessarily promote a focus on graduate student professionalization, but that it can and should have a profound capacity to carve out space for deep thought in mixed-methods thinking, pushing back against competing discourses of neoliberal vocationalism, funding and labor precarity on one hand, and technological utopianism and tool fetishization on the other. Thus, as a critical and technological space committed to practices and capacities rather than a more exclusive emphasis on scholarly DH, the lab can train students in agile, contextual, and rhetorical mindsets with which to enter technologically-mediated workplaces and lives.</p>
<h2 id="dh-lab-models-and-the-treatment-of-graduate-students">DH Lab Models and the Treatment of Graduate Students</h2>
<p>It is difficult to discuss the DH lab in a vacuum from the forces that create, shape, and reshape it over time. Here, we will review how the lab as a specific form of DH institution comes into being, with specific focus on funding models and projected inputs and outcomes from that funding. We will consider how the practice of DH in the United States and outside of it may affect the composition of labs and their graduate training. The graduate students who come to labor in the lab are a visible and direct result of the synergistic forces of funding and institutional shaping rather than consideration for the goals and objectives of graduate education. Based on these considerations, we will take a look at how various labs have approached graduate training and education as a part of that institutional model. We then argue that much of that graduate training and education is invisible because it is not tied to these funding models and resultant lab practices.</p>
<h2 id="training-graduate-students-in-the-dh-lab">Training (graduate students) in the DH lab</h2>
<p>Training offerings in DH labs relate closely to the mission of the lab itself. As with the Bowling Green example, a computing support lab model tends to support general training offerings for the academic community related to “particular types of software or specialist tools” provided by the lab itself<a class="footnote-ref" href="#warwick2012"> [warwick2012] </a>. A Big Humanities lab, on the other hand, might offer graduate students the opportunity to work as RAs on a particular large scale sponsored research project, and be trained to support that particular project. These are the two polar opposites, and there can be a blending of these offerings, and other kinds of offerings as well.</p>
<p>The DH lab offers a space for experiential learning that challenges a more traditional classroom environment<a class="footnote-ref" href="#thorp2010"> [thorp2010] </a>in that it can be the professionals employed by the lab — often designated as support staff or unaffiliated with a traditional humanities discipline — that stand to offer the most expertise for experiential digital research training for graduate students<a class="footnote-ref" href="#nowviskie2015"> [nowviskie2015] </a>. Yet this same condition raises several questions regarding graduate student education: In the post-tenure university, Who does and should train graduate students, and to what ends? Who are graduate students to become (i.e., paid research assistants on Big Humanities projects, researchers on their own projects, future faculty in disciplines, “alt-ac” research professionals in higher education or industry)? At an institution like Arizona State University, for example, that has seen radical restructuring of its academic programs to as to create space for fostering interdisciplinary work, how do future faculty become effectively trained and usefully integrated into explicitly interdisciplinary spaces? Finally, why might a Big Humanities-focused DH lab participate in graduate student professionalization at all, if not incentivized under its funding model? These questions, answered or not, do much to influence how the DH lab views its mission in the university vis-à-vis its own disciplinary structure, and furthermore raise additional questions about the value of promoting such work and about the possibilities for the DH lab model. It is here where we begin our discussion of our own graduate training experiment that sought to make the work of graduate training visible in our DH lab.</p>
<h2 id="a-case-study-the-stories-from-data-workshop">A Case Study: The “Stories from Data” Workshop</h2>
<p>We consider the affordances and constraints from such a model by offering a teaching case from our own Lab’s fall 2015 “Stories from Data” workshop in order to render visible a set of principles to guide professionalization of graduate students in the DH lab. The context for this case study is the Nexus Lab at Arizona State University. During our time employed at the Nexus Lab (as Director and Postdoctoral Fellow), it worked largely within the Big Humanities model: teams sought out large-scale and long-term funding; faculty partnerships for research spanned humanities and STEM disciplines; and upper administration aligned the lab with other units at the University invested in broad-reaching and big-impact work. However, part of the mission of the lab was to operate in a Big Humanities space while at the same time integrating technologies and lessons learned from that activity into graduate student training.</p>
<p>The Stories from Data workshop ran in the Fall Semester of 2015. The curriculum spanned fifteen weeks, beginning in the second week of classes. Hosted in the Lab, sessions took place from 1:00-3:00 p.m. on Friday afternoons. Attendance was free and open to all university staff, students, and faculty. We did not require consistent attendance in order to participate. We believe this contributed to enormous initial interest, from which emerged a steady cohort of staff, faculty, and students. The workshop began with seventy five participants, and after steady attrition, concluded with a group of twelve who remained consistent attendees and participants. Their backgrounds included rhetoric, sustainability, industrial engineering, computer science, and literature.</p>
<p>Stories from Data was an ongoing exercise in connecting participant expertise with the process and tools for decision making with data. In many ways, we sought to provide as much value as possible to participants by using the workshop as a way of codifying into the recognizable skillset of “visualization” the critical thinking, collaboration skills, and mixed methods analysis that unfolds perpetually in the context of interdisciplinary research. While the concept of “interdisciplinarity” can seem esoteric and elusive, the ideas of “visualization” and “data visualization” have a more immediate appeal outside academia and possess crosscutting benefits even within university research.</p>
<p>Our framing principle for the workshop was “People make decisions based on stories from data, not the data alone.” Our goals for the workshop engaged the cognitive, cultural, design, and narrative dimensions of visualization: 1) understand the tendencies and capabilities of users; 2) produce visualizations that help us think, not merely present information; and 3) learn how to tell a story from data that considers visual and non-visual narrative parts.</p>
<p>Generally each session fell into two parts, a presentation/discussion and a hands-on exercise. Each session lasted two to three hours. Consistently, we referred to the audience of visualizations as “users” rather than “viewers” to foreground the idea that visuals are rarely passively consumed.</p>
<h2 id="goal-1-understand-the-tendencies-and-capabilities-of-users">Goal 1: Understand the tendencies and capabilities of users</h2>
<p>The first weeks of the workshop consisted of discussing and exploring the capabilities and limitations of visualization users. In this phase of the workshop, we used ineffective visualizations as negative examples. We solicited students to discuss the charts with the goal of understanding the relationship between the data and visual elements, identifying the story produced from the data, and producing recommendations for how to improve each example. For instance, we discussed the world economy voronoi plot (see Figure 1) as visually impressive, but hardly navigable visually. The circular shape of the chart and the irregular shapes of the cells make it difficult to understand the relationship between the data and the area assigned to each country. The voronoi layout also makes the countries with smaller economies crowded and illegible, possibly recreating the perception perhaps the visualization was hoping to remedy. Participants also raised a concern about the use of red and green colors together that would pose accessibility concerns for colorblind users. The group wondered what a bar chart or hierarchical chart might clarify about the data, as well as discussed potential questions that could mobilize a revised visualization in a story: is the goal to call attention to inequity? To power dynamics? To correlations among large economies?</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Additionally, we drew from Jeff Johnson’s <em>Designing with the Mind in Mind</em> (2010) to highlight perceptual and cognitive limitations that humans face when apprehending visualizations. For example, Johnson calls attention to the limitations of human abilities to recall visual information, making it all the more important to facilitate comparisons rather than recollections. Additionally, once users learn a format and spatial layout, maintaining consistencies across multiple charts — and multiple points in a story — can be seen as a technique for aiding comprehension<a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2010"> [johnson2010] </a>. Alongside these issues, we discussed other sources of limitations in users, such as pre-existing assumptions — understood as “bias” to some participants and expanded upon as ideological, cultural, and linguistic contingencies by others — and how a user’s prior conditioning can affect interpretation and overall narrative.</p>
<h2 id="goal-2-produce-visualizations-that-help-us-think-not-merely-present-information">Goal 2: Produce visualizations that help us think, not merely present information</h2>
<p>Drawing from Ben Fry’s <em>Visualizing Data</em> (2014), the next phase of the workshop emphasized the planning and conceptualization of a visualization as an opportunity to engage, understand, question, and refine data. In this phase, participants spent time evaluating the data from which visualizations were designed. This involved understanding the structure of the data; namely, what constituted an object or series in the data, and what dimensions of the data are available. Conversations about data progressed to form questions about planning visualizations, and the specific insights they mean to enable. In other words, before we can begin visualizing, we have to decide the problem we are approaching.</p>
<p>Defining the problem, and evaluating that definition, is the key area where we encourage the participants to apply their expertise. What data exists and what visual roles it will play are necessary considerations. But what data is missing, or the conceptualization of the problem itself required critical thinking and reflection on participant expertise. During one session, we presented the group with data and charts about the global production and circulation of food from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture’s 2015 survey<a class="footnote-ref" href="#khoury2016"> [khoury2016] </a>. In this exercise, there were multiple spreadsheet files, each derived from both the survey and some statistical analysis of the survey data. These files by themselves included historical, geographical, agricultural, and economic data; the group had to decide together what kinds of visual problem solving were allowed or silenced by the state of the data.</p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="A group of participants around a table in discussion about representative limitations of the data." src=""
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw"

     ><figcaption>

</figure>
<p>The group consisted of participants with various expertise in rhetoric, sustainability, industrial engineering, computer science, and literature. By the end of the day’s session, the group did not ever reach the point of sketching out or brainstorming possible visuals. Instead, they conducted a lively discussion about the representative limitations of the data in its current state (see Figure 2). A sustainability view challenged the explanatory value of any visualizations that selectively presented countries, while rhetorical considerations advised against presenting all countries at once in a display that looked impressive but communicated little. Additionally, some were reluctant to show spatial relationships without also showing those relationships unfold over time. At stake in each of these threads in the conversation is how to make a series of representations (first data, then any visualization of that data) relevant and responsible to the disciplinary values of their expertise.</p>
<p>By mid semester, then, the group engaged in practices that saw visualization as a set of practices rather than a digital artifact or set of tools. Before any ink or pixels, there must be a relevant and coherent sequence of inquiries.</p>
<h2 id="goal-3-learn-how-to-tell-a-story-from-data-that-considers-visual-and-non-visual-narrative-parts">Goal 3: Learn how to tell a story from data that considers visual and non-visual narrative parts</h2>
<p>We used the concept of a “story” to invite participation from multiple disciplines and points of view. The workshop had spent a good deal of time and resources emphasizing visualization as a practice of reasoning through a problem, and in the final phase of the semester we circled back to the limitations and biases of visualization users that began the semester. This time, however, rather than use the idea of bias as a way to motivate our understanding of visualization design, we asked participants to consider the cultural biases and prior assumptions of visualization users. Each participant, as part of a final project, was responsible for presenting a data visualization of their making that was part of a broader narrative. The narrative would tell a story about a problem, relate that problem to an audience, and punctuate that story with a visualization that helped its users reason through data relevant to both the problem and the story about the problem. For instance, in working through the global agriculture data from earlier in the semester, one student produced a Sankey diagram (see Figure 3) that diagrammed the total breakdown of global produce by calorie type. In this story, understanding the contours of global nutrition was the problem, and the student chose a small subset of the data with only a handful of dimensions (by crop: total calories, carbohydrate calories, protein calories, and fat calories). From the much larger dataset about global calories and flows among countries and regions, the student was able to tell a straightforward story about the kinds of plant-based calories available globally. The final idea that non-carbohydrate calories are scarcer is clear from the framing of the narrative, the selection of the data, and the visual presentation of the data.</p>

<p>In the end, some participants excelled at programming, others at design, and still others at the stories and rhetorical positioning of the analytical narratives. No matter what the aptitude, discipline, and interests of the participants, constructing the “story from data” became a multi- disciplinary project where expertise could matter in a venue outside that expertise. An English doctoral student’s perspective and craft was just as important to crafting a story from data as a computer programmer or graphic designer. The consistent training about visualization as a critical thinking and communication exercise helped to connect humanities expertise to applicable skills in visualization and data literacy. The idea of thinking through what it means to have an argument seen by other groups provided opportunities to articulate the value of individuals’ knowledge and research. The practice of storytelling with data is experience relevant to science, business, engineering, medicine, and more<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dykes2016"> [dykes2016] </a>.</p>
<h2 id="principles-for-professionalizing-graduate-students-in-the-dh-lab">Principles for Professionalizing Graduate Students in the DH Lab</h2>
<p>The Stories from Data workshop provides a teaching case to make visible what the work of professionalizing graduate students <em>might</em> look like. This work temporarily suspends the goals of sponsored research and academic promotion. This work moves beyond the poles of teaching tools for machines and software purchased for the DH lab as a support center and teaching tasks for work on PI-driven Big Humanities projects. In fact, this professionalization work rejects easy assimilation into any lab model. It is not a lab during this kind of work, in the sense that specific instruments or a number of experts are there, all working around a common problem or issue. Yet, a DH lab is precisely the place where this professionalization work can take place, as a site of experiential, cross-disciplinary, cross-rank, academic-industry collaboration.</p>
<p>Instead, we argue for centering graduate students and their development as individuals, to prepare them for a wide variety of contingencies in their future career paths. These principles do not invoke a particular set of skills, as the tools and methods used in industry and in academia are just tools, not development of the individual who may use them. As Goldman Sachs banking director Matthew William Barrett said in an interview, “I used to joke that if you can find me someone who has a degree in figuring out patterns of imagery in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, I can teach him to break down a balance sheet in 30 minutes. What you want is a mind” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#pitts2010"> [pitts2010] </a>. The set of principles behind the Stories from Data workshop for graduate students do not derive from a particular digital skillset. “Tools” are not the same as initiation into practice, or experience with the principles of mixed methods work. This set of principles may be applied to a variety of substantive areas.</p>
<h2 id="principle-1-a-dh-lab-can-foster-cross-disciplinary-conversation-and-understanding">Principle 1: A DH lab can foster cross-disciplinary conversation and understanding</h2>
<p>By nature and design, a DH lab can serve as a space of contact for graduate students from the humanities and STEM disciplines who are approaching issues of shared concern. It is in this way that the DH lab becomes a contact zone, much as Mary Louise Pratt described as “social spaces where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly asymmetrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths as they are lived out in many parts of the world today” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#pratt1991"> [pratt1991] </a>. The collision course of the humanities and STEM in the same learning environment forces students to confront not only the epistemological differences between the disciplines, but the way the student’s own discipline circulates and is taken up (or not) across the humanities-STEM divide, a divide fraught with competing value systems and cultures. The students can see how they are heard across difference in the academy, and be able to make better sense of their place in the wider world outside of it with the training they have received in their discipline.</p>
<p>This involves, in part, understanding the benefits from being trained in a particular discipline and working with others who are trained according to different disciplinary ideals. Often, it is in collaborating across difference — mixing methods or juxtaposing competing ideas within the same discussion — that it becomes possible to break through a problem. Unfortunately, interdisciplinary collaboration is rarely taught or trained to academics, and as a result, grant-funded research projects across disciplines can fall apart. As Bendix et al. notes, “Thrown into strange company without preparation, ongoing guidance, or long-term professional incentives, researchers fall back onto disciplinary habits and raise disciplinary defenses” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bendix2017"> [bendix2017] </a>. The “strange” company of those across disciplines must then be made familiar for interdisciplinary collaboration to be successful.</p>
<p>This principle aligns with a concept suggested by Patricia Bizzell as she argues how Pratt’s contact zone theory may be applied to graduate study. Bizzell writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would also mean reorganizing graduate study [in English] and professional scholarly work in ways I hardly dare to suggest. I suppose that one would no longer become a specialist in American literature, a “Shakespeare man,” or a “compositionist.” Rather, people’s areas of focus would be determined by the kinds of rhetorical problems in which they were interested.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bizzell1994"> [bizzell1994] </a>We are not suggesting altering a disciplinary program of study for graduate students, but instead, that the DH lab has great potential to enable the kind of work that Bizzell describes should order the focus of graduate study. In fact, the DH lab model for extracurricular cross-disciplinary inquiry has two benefits that altering the curriculum does not. First, it alleviates the concern posed earlier about training academics with a disciplinary identity. Here, we show that cross-disciplinary work in the contact zone of the lab accentuates a graduate student’s understanding of their discipline and how it travels. Further, organizing a workshop like Stories from Data with the “rhetorical problem” of how data is visualized and used also fulfills the kind of large-scale problem solving that funders of the labs themselves seek out. In this way, the DH lab alleviates concerns of those anxious about interdisciplinarity while also doing exactly what funders hope the DH will do.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="principle-2-a-dh-lab-can-offer-experiences-that-enhance-rhetorical-critical-and-contextual-mindsets-while-simultaneously-buildingmakinghacking">Principle 2: A DH lab can offer experiences that enhance rhetorical, critical, and contextual mindsets while simultaneously building/making/hacking</h2>
<p>It is neither new nor controversial to say that the DH lab has the capacity for experiential learning. What is harder to abide is the work of combining that experiential building/making/hacking with rhetorical, critical, and contextual understanding of the very technologies we learn to build/make/hack. As discussed earlier, the strictures of the semester system and the traditional classroom render this work nearly impossible in the curriculum. The workshop setting allowed those who wanted to invest the time to do so. This allowed the workshop to spend its time in lengthy discussion and then hands on exercises scaffolded to lead to the building of data visualizations with several different tools and methods.</p>
<p>The development of rhetorical and critical mindsets, and a greater understanding of the context of the tools we use, often coincided with team-based experiences across disciplines. For example, when the cross-disciplinary team tasked with creating a visualization from the agricultural survey data could not agree on an interpretative approach to the dataset, it revealed that it is much more complicated to collaborate with a tool than to just use it alone. Several students from the course went home to gain a greater proficiency with d3.js, but everyone in the workshop gained a greater intercultural proficiency around the context of use of the tool, a proficiency that will serve graduate students in all disciplines well, wherever they may find themselves in career or life.</p>
<p>Rhetorical and critical mindsets are also developed through the exposure to other disciplinary orientations towards technology. When humanities students critiqued the racial or gendered characteristics of a data visualization, students in STEM — not frequently exposed to cultural concerns — took notice. The reverse also took place, where students in STEM readily noticed that humanities students would be much more recalcitrant when it was time to build, instead reading or talking through the hands on components of the exercises. On the other hand, STEM students were much quicker to build first, question later (or never), which humanities students also found difficult to understand. However, over time, it helped each set to see how certain practices and activities made certain disciplines more comfortable, and how that might translate to the building of technologies and other products and services in the workplace.</p>
<h2 id="principle-3-a-dh-lab-can-render-visible-systems-of-power-that-circulate-in-their-disciplines-in-the-academy-and-in-industry">Principle 3: A DH lab can render visible systems of power that circulate in their disciplines, in the academy, and in industry</h2>
<p>By distancing the lab from both sponsored research and academic advancement (meaning, the workshop was not geared toward either), we aimed to create a workshop that was a space for graduate students to explore the material conditions of their education and employment. Inevitably — and likely because no one in the room was in a position of power over anyone else, as the workshop was not-for-credit and lab professionals were not affiliated with the disciplines or the tenure stream in the university — discussions became as much about labor in and out of the academy as well as the tools and methods for performing that labor.</p>
<p>Why do graduate students come to the DH lab? When graduate students arrived in our lab, they voiced concerns. Worried about the academic job market, about the kinds of work in industry they feel they may or may not be prepared to do, and about the kinds of menial work they already had, as RAs or as staff at the university. We are not alone, as Nowviskie writes about The Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Scholars’ Lab, we work for the betterment of the individual graduate students who come our way — conscious that they are laboring within larger systems that are broken and that can wound them. We want to broaden then their options and help them build the technical and conceptual skills that will enable their active engagement with the humanities well into its digital future. We hope to render them more capable of constructing new systems and of resisting inappropriate ones, from wherever they may land.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#nowviskie2015"> [nowviskie2015] </a>In this way, we agree with Nowviskie that “inappropriate” systems exist not just in the academy, but in industry and public life as well, and it is the work of professionalizing graduate students to be able to recognize inequities and injustices in their workplaces and in civic life, particularly as they surround the making, circulation, and use of digital technologies.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the last several years, several essays have been written about the state of the DH initiative in the United States and its successes and challenges. In 2011, Alan Liu issued a report and a critique of DH. He asked, “Are the digital humanities ready to live up to their responsibility to represent the humanities and higher education as the latter negotiates a new relation to postindustrial society?” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#liu2012"> [liu2012] </a>. Liu’s critique stemmed from what he saw as a divide between those who came out of humanities computing, who “lacks almost all cultural-critical awareness” and those working from new media studies, who are “indiscriminately critical of society and global informational empire without sufficient focus on the specifically institutional — in this case, higher education — issues at stake” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#liu2012"> [liu2012] </a>. Many other critiques of the Mellon Foundation-funded American DH initiative have been raised in recent academic trade publications, such as Brennan’s recent polemic “The Digital Humanities Bust” in <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#brennan2017"> [brennan2017] </a>. These critiques range from upbraiding a system that would fund particular types of scholarship perceived as lacking the rigor of more conventional forms of critique, to the questioning of the value of methods in DH for textual analysis<a class="footnote-ref" href="#brennan2017"> [brennan2017] </a>.</p>
<p>The workshop model and its set of principles for professionalization offer an opportunity to visualize a DH that does a different kind of work than what is often targeted in these criticisms. Much of the unrest and debate mentioned above focuses almost exclusively on past or current PI-driven, sponsored research projects in DH. What a workshop like Stories from Data makes visible is how DH might inform a digital future populated with professionals who do different kinds of work, in the academy, in industry, and in public life. The graduate students we trained experienced a curriculum that was skill-oriented, but anchored in a commitment to critical thinking and articulating their own expertise to the skills at hand. As graduate students assessing their professional trajectories and employment prospects, they experienced and interrogated the political, economic, and cultural realities of working with digital technologies, inside and outside of the humanities. They recognize the changing face of the neoliberalized university as well as industry hiring practices that largely reward experience with up-to-date technology tools devoid of the context of use. And, by working as a place for student development, the DH lab had given them opportunities to prepare for both.</p>
<p>Indeed, a key value of this kind of training is that it connects <em>ways of thinking</em> in addition to instilling a <em>specific skill set.</em> The Stories from Data curriculum has since been taken up in multiple venues on our campus across disciplines and participant groups. It formed the foundations of a subsequent workshop, “Decision Design for Sustainability Approaches,” produced in concert with the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University. Additionally, the materials and lessons from the workshop continue to inform and be refined by interdisciplinary, data-driven research and leadership training among humanities doctoral students, STEM students, active-duty military, and student-veterans at the Library’s Unit for Data Science (co-author Simeone serves as current Director).</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we hope to mentor graduate students who can render visible to the public how the academy contributes to knowledge production vis-à-vis technology. This is not a new argument; in fact, many digital humanists on large-scale projects echo this call to improve the public’s understanding of and engagement in DH projects.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#oh2013"> [oh2013] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#flanders2013"> [flanders2013] </a>. Further, on the week of the submission of this article, data scientist and author Cathy O’Neil wrote an op-ed for <em>The New York Times</em> titled “The Ivory Tower Can’t Keep Ignoring Tech.” In this piece, she argues “We need academia to step up to fill in the gaps in our collective understanding about the new role of technology in shaping our lives&hellip;It’s absolutely within the abilities of academic research to study such examples and to push against the most obvious statistical, ethical or constitutional failures and dedicate serious intellectual energy to finding solutions” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#oneil2017"> [oneil2017] </a>. While controversial in several respects (including her description of how data science is taught in higher education), O’Neil points to exactly the issue Stories from Data is designed to combat — our graduate students can identify and translate their role in exactly this work to multiple stakeholders after they leave the lab, and in a way that communicates their value as problem solvers in the issues of concern that O’Neil outlines here. In the case of the lab, then, the impact on the issues of “math destruction” and data and society is not measured in what is formally studied and published by faculty with the help of graduate students, but the subsequent conduct of participants in the world outside of academia or a home department. This helps DH labs to envision the training of graduate students toward careers in their own right, driven by their convictions and talents rather than labs focusing on what faculty teach or research<a class="footnote-ref" href="#anderson2016"> [anderson2016] </a>. As a way of engendering reflective technological practice, the workshop space is designed to avoid replication of any model, either industry-based or academic. No graduate student in Stories from Data is pursuing a PhD in data science. Their work with data — and extracting knowledge from data — is meant to enrich their understanding of storytelling and reasoning with data. Crucially, that understanding includes critique, production, and translation. While we hope that scholars based in universities continue to shed light into the need for more deliberation and oversight when it comes to the power that big data, artificial intelligence, and algorithms hold over the lives of individuals. But it has been our mission that the graduate students we train in the lab — who eventually become professionals and citizens in any number of spaces — meaningfully intervene in those same systems as they continue to challenge our ethics, values, and possible futures.</p>
