<p>With the<a href="https://ach.org/ach-statement-on-black-lives-matter-structural-racism-and-our-organization/">Association for Computers and the Humanities</a>, Digital Humanities Quarterly stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, and seeks to oppose systemic racism. We recognize the crucial role academic journals play in shaping perceptions about what research topics, methods, and authors are important, and in creating a visible profile of the fields they cover. DHQ recognizes that an academic journal must take active steps to achieve social change and social justice, and to make the field of digital humanities visible as a space for racial and gender equity. DHQ has not done enough in the past to recruit, support, and center the work of scholars of color. As part of ACH’s planned review of policies and organizational culture, DHQ commits to taking action based on that review. In addition, in DHQ’s already planned review and update of its editorial boards and policies in the coming year, we will focus on correcting the journal’s racial imbalance in both its editorial personnel and its publications. Finally, DHQ commits to a special issue at least every other year on a topic explicitly related to race and its relationship to additional axes of oppression, including gender, sexuality, disability, nationality, and language. A special issue on race in the rising DH generation is already under way. We welcome suggestions from the community on additional steps the journal could take.</p>

<p>Our study aims to investigate the historical phenomenon of censorship of Hebrew manuscripts performed by the Catholic Church in Italy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> during the 16th-18th centuries (1550-1775). Thus far, most of the studies on the censorship of Jewish manuscripts and books during this period were done in a qualitative and focused manner<a class="footnote-ref" href="#baruchson-arbib2007"> [baruchson-arbib2007] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#phillips2016"> [phillips2016] </a>.</p>
<p>Recently, quantitative methods have been embraced by scholars for the analysis of Big Data in the Humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kaplan2017"> [kaplan2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#leizeng2017"> [leizeng2017] </a>. Accordingly, in this paper we present the first (to the best of our knowledge) large-scale quantitative analysis of historical Hebrew manuscript data. For the purpose of this study, we identified 5,185 censored manuscripts in the catalogue of the Department of Manuscripts and the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts in the National Library of Israel (<a href="http://web.nli.org.il">(http://web.nli.org.il)</a>), which represent the largest collection of Hebrew manuscript metadata in the world.</p>
<p>In Ethington (2007) the author argues that “the past is the set of all places made by human action. … Knowledge of the past, therefore, is literally cartographic: a mapping of the places of history indexed to the coordinates of spacetime” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ethington2007"> [ethington2007] </a>. Inspired by the multi-perspective framework of Ethington&rsquo;s theory of visual representation of the past we propose a new multi-dimensional methodology for the large-scale quantitative analysis of historical manuscript data. Particularly, we examined the temporal, geographic, actor- and subject-based dimensions of the censored manuscripts and also compared the statistical distribution of censored manuscripts on these dimensions to the non-censored manuscript corpus. The proposed methodology is open-ended, as it is not limited to the dimensions specified above and can be extended with more dimensions which might be relevant for a given data collection.</p>
<p>The availability of a relatively large censorship database on one hand, and the ability to apply to it modern analysis and visualization techniques on the other hand, has the potential to discover new insights into censorship activity over the years. This includes both revealing unknown phenomena or trends as well as bringing new (mainly quantitative) perspectives to known facts.</p>
<p>Thus, the research questions posed in this research are:<br>
How are censored manuscripts distributed in various dimensions mentioned above? More specifically we explored:<br>
When were the peaks, inclines and declines in censorship activity and can they be explained by historical knowledge of the corresponding periods?In what cities did censorship take place?What major geographic transitions can be observed from the large-scale quantitative analysis of censorship data and what is known about them in historical literature?Who were the most dominant censors?Did censors work in collaboration and to what extent?What was the rate of repetitive censorship, when a certain manuscript was censored more than once?Finally, what were the main subjects of the censored manuscripts?</p>
<p>What are the differences between censored manuscripts in Italy in the 16th-18th centuries vs. non-censored manuscripts in the collection in various dimensions? These differences can shed light on special characteristics of the censored corpus which distinguish it from the rest of the manuscripts. Particularly, as part of the spatial analysis we investigated the following phenomena:<br>
Whether there is a difference in the distribution of censored vs. non-censored manuscript script types and whether this distribution changes over time?Whether the distribution of censored manuscripts among their current storage locations differs from the overall distribution of storage locations of the dataset?In addition, from the subject analysis perspective we examined: Whether the distributions of censored vs. non-censored manuscripts differ according to subjects?</p>
<h2 id="historical-background">Historical Background</h2>
<p>In the context of the Counter-Reformation, during the 16th-18th centuries, the Catholic Church closely supervised written and printed literature. Papal bulls were issued against proscribed books, and indices were drawn up containing lists of prohibited books ( <em>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</em> ), which also included Hebrew books. In addition to the indices that were written for literature in general, some indices listed Hebrew books only (see<a href="#prebor2003">Prebor 2003</a>;<a href="#raz-krakotzkin2007">Raz-Krakotzkin 2007</a>;<a href="#francesconi2012">Francesconi 2012</a>;<a href="#francesconi2016">Francesconi 2016</a>;<a href="#phillips2016">Phillips 2016</a>;<a href="#vanboxel2016">Van Boxel 2016</a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The techniques of censorship directed towards Hebrew literature evolved concurrently with, and as part of the development of church censorship as a whole, and were formulated by the same bodies. Italian Jews who wished to save their books operated in two ways: on the one hand, internal censorship of Hebrew printed books and, on the other hand, by lobbying the Pope and Church leaders to ease the instructions for confiscating books and forbidding the printing of the Talmud.</p>
<p>The Jewish lobbying of the Pope and Church leaders to ease directives regarding confiscation of manuscripts and books led to the operation of external censorship<a class="footnote-ref" href="#baruchson-arbib2007"> [baruchson-arbib2007] </a>. One of the concessions won by Italian Jews was the introduction of the censorship of manuscripts and printed books possessed by the Jewish public, as an alternative to confiscation and wholesale destruction of virtually all the books they possessed. The termpurification(Ziquq) is the commonly used term in this context, parallel to the Latin termexpurgatio<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sonne1942"> [sonne1942] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#benayahu1971"> [benayahu1971] </a>. To carry out the expurgation, the Church put censors at the disposal of the communities, most of them apostates and experts in the Hebrew language, and the communities undertook to pay their fees. The involvement of the Jews in the purification work arose from the fundamental approach of the Church that the Jews were responsible for theforbidden literaturein their possession.</p>
<p>The owners of Hebrew books were required in the name of the Inquisition to hand them over to the censors, who kept them in the local office. Concealing books was punished by their confiscation and a heavy fine, and in certain cases, also by the confiscation of property and imprisonment. The books collected were examined by the censors, who destroyed the forbidden books and punished those who kept them. The books of a controversial nature were expurgated and returned to their owners with the approval of the censor.</p>
<p>The censorship procedure entailed erasing or replacing all the paragraphs which, in the view of the censors, contravened the principles of Christianity, its customs and rites, or those paragraphs which contained blasphemy, heresy or errors. When the expurgation of the book was completed, the censor wrote a short approval note. The approval note was written for the most part on the final page of the book and sometimes on the title page. Proof of the activity of the various censors can be found in a large number of manuscripts and printed works which have survived until the present day, and in which ink erasures, emendations, signs of removed pages and the signature of the censor can be observed.</p>
<p>In the next section we review literature on computational methods for digitization and large-scale quantitative analysis of historical corpora and present several case studies of this research paradigm.</p>
<h2 id="related-work">Related work</h2>
<p>In the past decade computational methods were proposed and implemented for historical data analysis, e.g. Geographic Information Systems and spatial analysis for historical collections (see<a href="#gregory2007">Gregory and Healye 2007</a>;<a href="#ayers2010">Ayers 2010</a>;<a href="#moretti2005">Moretti 2005</a>;<a href="#knowles2008">Knowles and Hillier 2008</a>), temporal and subject-based analysis and visualisation of historical and cultural heritage collections (see<a href="#glinka2017">Glinka et al. 2017</a>;<a href="#chandna2016">Chandna et al. 2016</a>).</p>
<p>In this section we review several projects applying quantitative analysis of historical data on literary resources, such as hand-written manuscripts and printed books. The Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies, maintained by the University of Pennsylvania Libraries, presents the multi-faceted analysis of the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (SDBM) (<a href="https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/">https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/</a>). The database contains over 200,000 records representing 90,000 hand-written manuscripts from diverse collections and institutions (Van Hooland and Verborgh, 2014). The SDBM&rsquo;s website displays statistics on manuscript distribution over time and space as well as by subject, authorship and provenance based on historical sales lists. The Stanford project Republic of Letters presents quantitative analysis and visualisation of Voltaire’s letters, distribution of letters and writers displayed on a map and timeline, as well as their correspondence network<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> .</p>
<p>A closely related project which aimed to organize and quantitatively analyse the data on Jewish historical manuscripts is <em>SfarData</em> (<a href="http://sfardata.nli.org.il/">http://sfardata.nli.org.il/</a>). <em>SfarData</em> is the codicological data-base of the Hebrew Palaeography Project which locates all the medieval codices written in Hebrew script, which contain explicit production dates (until 1540) or at least scribe names (some 6000 codices). The project aims to study and document the codices’ visual and measurable material features and scribal practices in situ; to classify these features and practices in order to build a historical typology of the hand-produced Hebrew book. This, in turn, provides users of Hebrew manuscripts with a tool for identifying the production region and assessing the period of the studied manuscripts<a class="footnote-ref" href="#beit-arié2018"> [beit-arié2018] </a>.</p>
<p>Several projects investigate printed book distribution over time and space. The Footprints project maintains a database of printed Jewish books (<a href="https://footprints.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/)">https://footprints.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/)</a>. The goal is to consolidate and analyse scattered information on Jewish books (in Hebrew, in other Jewish languages, and on books in Latin and non-Jewish vernaculars with Judaica content) in order to build up a composite view of the movement of Jewish texts and ideas from place to place and across time. The French Book Trade in Enlightenment Europe (FBTEE) project<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burrows2012"> [burrows2012] </a>(<a href="http://fbtee.uws.edu.au/stn/">http://fbtee.uws.edu.au/stn/</a>) uses database technology to map the French book trade across late-Enlightenment Europe, between 1769 and 1794. It investigates best-selling texts and authors; reading tastes across Europe; changing patterns of demand over time; and networks of exchange in the print-trade. The project tracks the movement of around 400,000 copies of 4,000 books across Europe. It details, where possible, the exact editions of these works, the routes by which they travelled and the locations of the clients that bought or sold them.</p>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<h2 id="the-catalogues-data-structure">The catalogue&rsquo;s data structure</h2>
<p>The catalogue of the Department of Manuscripts and the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts in the National Library of Israel, lists most of the Hebrew manuscripts in existence in the world, whether held in public or in private collections. The catalogue provides rich data about these manuscripts, including references to censorship (<a href="http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/manuscripts/Pages/default.aspx">http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/manuscripts/Pages/default.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>The manuscript catalogue was exported as an XML file on January 31, 2016, and contained a total of 163,248 records. First of all, we excluded 30,418 Genizah manuscript records (18.6% of all the records). The Genizah manuscripts are fragments of codicological units that were separated from their original manuscripts (due in part to damage or deterioration of codices) and were preserved in designated storage units called Genizah (from Hebrewגניזה, the verbal noun signifying the act of storing/archiving). Most of them are from the famous Cairo Genizah and some are from the European Genizah. These fragments are not relevant to our study because they have different characteristics than codex manuscripts and since Genizah research is a separate field of study<a class="footnote-ref" href="#richler1990"> [richler1990] </a>.</p>
<p>Next, in order to create a dedicated censored manuscript collection, we automatically searched the catalogue&rsquo;s XML file for records with the word stemcensor(both in English and in Hebrew). In almost all of the cases, a propercensorstem was found in a dedicated MARC field, leaving only the cases where some morphological variations of the stemcensorwere found for manual inspection. The obtained dataset was further narrowed by filtering out some tens of manuscripts that were not censored in Italy and/or were censored later than 1775. The final dataset contains 5,185 censored manuscripts.</p>
<p>The structure of the catalogue follows a fundamental observation about the formation of medieval codices. The wordmanuscripthas multiple meanings including: scrolls and codices, entire volumes (these can include several works copied by different scribes either at the same time or in different periods), a fragment of a few folios or a single folio. In our research we analyzed only codices. In every codex we found three fundamental layers: (1) the entire manuscript – the Bibliographic Unit (BU) that refers to the physical entity comprising the entire codex with its shelf-mark in the collection (generally corresponding to microfilm numbers). (2) Codicological Units (CU) – Some of the bibliographic units include a number of codicological units, namely a number of different parts of the manuscripts that were produced in different locations and/or at different time periods, either with or without a common theme. (3) Paleographical Units – The codicological units can also contain a number of paleographical units, and fragments written by different hands<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sirat2002"> [sirat2002] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#beit-arié2018"> [beit-arié2018] </a>.</p>
<p>The catalogue database&rsquo;s basic unit, the record, describes a single CU. When the entire manuscript comprises a single CU (i.e. the codex is a single manuscript produced in one place and time), then the BU and the CU overlap and we obtain aunified codex<a class="footnote-ref" href="#beit-arié2018"> [beit-arié2018] </a>. The record&rsquo;s data, in this case, refers to this manuscript as a whole (the majority, more than 90% of the manuscripts in the catalogue are of such a unified nature). The catalogue does not have, however, an independent notion (e.g. a special record type) of BU. Rather, when a codex comprises several CUs (termed as anassembled codex- multi-CU), the catalogue contains a special record, anindex recordthat describes and lists the CUs of this codex BU. This set of CUs (excluding the index record) comprises a multi-CU BU with the shelf-number as its unique ID. In contrast, when there is a series of records that share a shelf number, but there is no index record with the same shelf number, we did not construct a BU for them and treated each record as an independent BU that contains a single CU. The index records themselves were not counted while calculating the various statistics of this study as in most cases they only summarize the data already contained in the individual CU records. However, we did use the data contained in index records when we built the study dataset, mainly as a means to verify the completeness of the data gathered from the BUs individual records (e.g. in some cases, the cataloguers specified the normalized full censor name only in the index record, while in the individual records they only gave a partial name).</p>
<p>In many cases it is difficult to decide when exactly in time a multi-CU BU (a codex) was bound. For example, if two censor signatures appear in a single BU, one dated to 1590 and the other dated to 1600, then one possibility is that this codex was bound before censorship (i.e. before 1590 (and censored together, while another possibility is that different CUs in this codex were censored in different settings/occasions only to be later bound together. Also, in some cases when the censor signed the manuscript, he also wrote the name of the place where the censorship took place (e.g. Mantua, Lugo). Following the previous example, by comparing the 1590&rsquo;s place of censorship to the 1600&rsquo;s place of censorship one may learn about manuscript transitions between people&rsquo;s hands and places. We manually checked all the BUs that contain two CUs or more. For each such BU, we used several inference rules to determine whether the signatures that the codex contains refer to all the manuscripts (CUs) in this BU or not. For instance, when the signature(s) appears at the end of the codex we assumed that the signature(s) refer(s) to the entire BU. If different types of script were used in different CUs of the BU, this can be an indication for distinct manuscripts that were censored separately.</p>
<p>Based on the above observations, BUs can be logically divided into two types of virtual entities:Whole Censored UnitandNon-Censored Unit. AWhole Censored Unit(WCU) groups CUs (of the given BU( that underwent censorship as a whole textual unit. The rest of the CUs in a BU, which are non-censored CUs are grouped under aNon-Censored Unit(NCU). We, thus, split partially or wholly censored BUs to one or multiple WCUs and a single NCU (see<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>We found that out of the 586 examined BUs, 428 were censored as a single WCU. Out of the remaining 158 BUs, 144 BUs have undergone censorship as a single WCU and were bound together with a non-censored unit at a later time. In 13 cases, we identified two separate WCU units, and in only one case did we split a BU into three distinct WCUs as we could identify that each one of them had been censored at different occasions and only later bound together into a single physical codex.</p>
<h2 id="the-proposed-data-model">The proposed data model</h2>
<p>In this study we adopted the event-based modelling approach presented in<a href="#zhitomirsky-geffet2016">Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Prebor 2016</a>and defined three types of events relevant to the goals of this research:</p>
<p>Manuscript creation event (CRE) – representing an individual CU&rsquo;s creation including the creation date and place, the script type and subject/s of the manuscript;Manuscript censorship event (CE) – representing a single censorship action on a single WCU encapsulating the date and location of the censorship action, and the involved censor/s name, life/activity period and location/s (if known); there can be multiple CEs associated with the same WCU at different periods and locations, each CE might be associated with multiple censors involved in it, and, apparently, the same censor can take part in different CEs;Manuscript storage event (SE) – representing the information on current storage (an institution and its geographic location) of an individual BU.</p>

The blue ellipses represent the event types (Storage Event - SE, Creation Event - CRE and Censorship Event - CE) and the rectangles are their main attributes. The hyphenated lines representpart-ofrelationships between the data entities, according to the dataset structure depicted in Figure 1 - CU is part-of a WCU or an NCU, and WCU and NCU are parts of a BU.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to the attributes of these types of events (represented as rectangles in Figure 2), the manuscript dataset was divided into subsets, such as censored (WCUs) vs. non-censored (NCUs) manuscripts. These subsets’ data were analysed separately in different dimensions, then the findings were compared and differences between the subsets were analysed.</p>
<h2 id="data-analysis-methodology">Data analysis methodology</h2>
<p>First, the corpus of manuscripts underwent a process of data cleaning and normalization. This process included decomposition of catalogue fields with mixed information into its defined atomic entities (e.g. people names, events, dates and places), standardization of a variety of date formats in the catalogue (e.g. specific Hebrew or Gregorian dates, ranges of years, centuries), and names of places (which appear in different languages and without the name of the country or geographic coordinates). Missing information was completed as well, using existing authority files and ontologies, such as VIAF (<a href="https://viaf.org/">https://viaf.org/</a>) and Geonames (<a href="http://www.geonames.org/">http://www.geonames.org/</a>). As part of this place normalization process we also obtained the coordinates of all the mentioned places in the collection which were extracted from the abovementioned authority files. The data normalization process was performed semi-automatically. It was based on identifying lexical patterns for each ontological entity, and further manual correction and completion by two experts in manuscript studies. For instance, for extraction of the censorship event’s location from the following string in the catalogue: censor signature: “LUGO 1611 CAMILLO JAGHEL” , the matching pattern was &lt;CENSOR * [PLACE] [DATE] [NAME]&gt;, thus LUGO was retrieved and then looked up in the Geonames’ “1000cities” list.</p>
<p>Next, we performed a systematic event-based analysis of the manuscript corpus. In addition to the descriptive statistical analysis we propose a new multi-dimensional methodology for a large-scale quantitative analysis of the historical manuscript data. The following types of variables were investigated for each of the dimensions:</p>
<p>For the temporal dimension: we examined the date of CRE (a CU creation event) and the date(s) of CE(s) (a WCU&rsquo;s censorship events).For the spatial dimension: we used the place of CRE, the place(s) of CE(s), the current place of the corresponding BU storage, and the CU&rsquo;s type of script (the scribe&rsquo;s writing type is determined by its country of origin (Beit-Arié, 2018,) which points out to the place of writing of the manuscript – although it should be considered that sometimes writers moved to other countries while still keeping their original script type.For the actor dimension: an individual censor activity was examined in terms of the number of CEs in which the censor was involved.For the subject dimension: we analysed subjects assigned to a CU.</p>
<p>Based on the above dimensions and variables a three-phase analysis has been performed:</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics and distribution of censored manuscript collection (WCUs) in multiple dimensions;Comparative analysis of the distribution of the two sub-collections of manuscripts, WCUs (censored manuscripts) vs. NCUs (non-censored manuscripts) in various dimensions.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h2 id="descriptive-statistics-of-the-censored-manuscript-corpus">Descriptive statistics of the censored manuscript corpus</h2>
<p>Only 5,185 CUs have censorship information recorded for them in the catalogue. These 5,185 CUs are grouped in 2,466 WCUs, while the other 118,921 non-censored CUs are grouped in 85,562 NCUs (as shown in Table 1). The total of 124,106 CUs are associated with 87,848 BUs. As explained before, there are cases when a single BU was (manually)splitinto a WCU and an NCU or cases when a BU wassplitinto more than a single WCU (a total of 158 of both cases). Note however, that the vast majority of cases (87,690) are indeed cases where a BU consists of either a single WCU or a single NCU. Moreover, note that 79,415 BUs (90% of all the BUs in the study corpus) are unified codices, that is, BUs that comprise a single CU.<br>

The 2,466 WCUs are associated with 3,914 instances of Censorship Events (CEs) (see<a href="#table02">Table 2</a>). The number of CEs is greater than the number of WCUs since in many cases, a WCU has been censored more than once, thus having more than one CE associated with it as discussed below. From Table 2 it can be noticed that in addition to the 3,190 CE instances where the censor responsible for the censorship was identified, in 724 cases, there is a clear notion of censorship, but no censor was documented in the manuscript&rsquo;s record.</p>
<p>Out of the 3,914 CEs, we filtered out 64 CEs: 56 CEs did not occur in Italy (and also didn&rsquo;t occur in the study period), and 8 Italian CEs were excluded since they occurred after 1775. The resulted dataset of Italian censorship events in the period of 1550-1775 consists, therefore, of 3,850 CEs (in 2,408 WCUs), 677 (17.6%) of which are un-named cases (see<a href="#table02">Tables 2</a>and<a href="#table03">3</a>). The earliest identified evidence of censorship in a manuscript in Italy is from 1554 and only two censorship events of Italian identified censorship have a recorded date after 1775 (in 1802 and in 1833), which fall outside our study period of 1550-1775.<br>

From Table 3 we observe that out of the 677 CEs in Italy that have no censor name associated with them, in 513 cases a censorship signature was blurry and thus could not be identified. In 151 cases a clear sign of censorship text erasures is present in the manuscript, but without a signature, and in 13 cases the cataloguers identified self-censorship actions.<br>

A rather interesting finding from analyzing the censorship events of the 2,408 WCUs in our corpus is the number of re-occurring censorship actions, that is, censorship of manuscripts that have been already censored. In other words, these are the cases where the same WCU (a single or a bounded set of CUs) has been submitted for approval to the same or a different censor at various times and locations. Of the 2,408 WCUs, 992 WCUs (41%) were censored more than once (see the distribution in Table 4). For example, the WCU - PARIS BN Velins 908 (identified by the shelf number F 73304) has been censored on four different occasions by four different censors, according to this manuscript’s record in the catalogue. It bears Luigi da Bologna’s signature from 1599, Camillo Jagel’s signature from 1623, Renato de Modena’s from 1626 and Girolamo da Durazzano’s from 1640. WCU - Moscow - Russian State Library, Ms. Guenzburg 147 (F 6831), on the other hand, records Girolamo da Durazzano’s signature, twice: once from 1640 and then from 1641, which suggests that this manuscript was censored in two consecutive years by the same censor (this manuscript has an earlier third signature by Renato de Modena from 1626).</p>
<p>The fact that Hebrew printed books have undergone repeated censorship is well known as is mentioned, for example, in<a href="#baruchson-arbib2007">a study by Baruchson-Arbib and Prebor (2007)</a>. What we are showing in our study is that a) the repeated censorship occurs in handwritten books as well, and more importantly b) that its scope is quite substantial: in total, for the 2,408 censored manuscripts (the WCUs) in our study, compared to an expected 2,408 censorship events (CEs) (one for each), 3,850 distinct CEs are registered for these manuscripts, i.e. 1,442 additional, repeated CEs (see<a href="#table04">Table 4</a>). This finding may indicate that the repeated censorship phenomenon cannot be explained only by sporadic actions by local censors, and that much more weight should be attributed to other, more general, explanations that were given to that phenomenon.</p>
<p>Several directions were suggested to explain this phenomenon. One explanation for this phenomenon is possibly that Church authorities feared that the Jewscorrectedtheir manuscripts after the censorship and hence re-checking is required. However, the substantial amount of renewed censorship must also be attributed to factors relating to the Church’s conduct on one hand, and the conduct of local inquisition administrations, on the other hand. Firstly, the act of censorship of Hebrew texts did not receive an official and formal authorization. As a direct consequence, manuscripts which were approved by an official censor did not gain the official recognition of the Church. Also, the Church’s policy regarding the censorship of Hebrew books was seldom changed as new Popes came into office and the rules by which censors should examine the text did also change and a stricter expurgation policy was adopted in the course of time<a class="footnote-ref" href="#raz-krakotzkin2007"> [raz-krakotzkin2007] </a>. On a local inquisition basis, censors apparently doubted their predecessors’ work for negligence or even deliberate eye-closing facing the monetary benefits from the Jews who paid for their job.</p>
<p>The findings in our study show that re-occurring censorship is a phenomenon that spread across time and across places. There are cases where repetitive censorship took place in the same place, while in other cases, the repeating censorship occurred in different place(s), and usually by different censor(s). Table 4 summarizes the repetitive censorship statistics. More detailed investigation, however, which will be dedicated to this phenomenon, could produce more insight. It may identify the censors who are responsible for repeated censorship more than others, it may find whether the repeated censorship happened on specific years or places, it might supply some characteristic as to the time elapsed between CEs of the same manuscript (e.g. is re-occurring censorship more common after a long time since previous censorship or maybe shorter elapsed time is more common).<br>

By lexical processing the censorship recording in the catalogue, we were able to automatically identify the cases where more than one censor was responsible for a censorship mission. Part of these cases were identified by having the censors’ signatures on the same page with a single mention of the year of the censorship (e.g. Alessandro Scipione 1597 (275b); Dominico Irosolomitano (275b)) like in the example of the campaign of expurgation by a censorship committee that was in Mantua in 1595-1597 (see below). Other cases were identified by their unique form of the censor’s approval text which explicitly mentions the multiple censors as in the following example: “Subsignavi ego Guidus menotius &hellip; Jac Geraldini &hellip; 28 Marti 1556” .<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="temporal-analysis-of-the-dataset">Temporal analysis of the dataset</h2>
<h2 id="censorship-events-dates">Censorship Events Dates</h2>
<p>We first looked at the years when the censorship actually took place and have used for this analysis the subset of the 2,901 precisely dated CEs out of the whole set of 3,850 CEs in the database. We have plotted a 5-year bin-based histogram of 2,901 dated CEs (see<a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>). The immediate observation from inspecting the histogram in Figure 3 is that although the recorded range of manuscript censorship in Italy is 222 years long (1554-1775), the majority of the censorship events took place during a much shorter period. The first substantial narrower period corresponds to the years 1589-1602 (with 36.0% of the total dated CEs) and the second substantial period corresponds to the years 1607-1629 (with 49.1% of the total dated CEs).</p>

</figure>
<p>This wave-like distribution of CEs along the study time period supports the historical knowledge we have about censorship activity in Italy. Much of the censorship was performed in accordance with the instructions of the church and local leaders and was the result of the activity of a number of censors who were active in certain years. The first big wave corresponds to the years 1589-1602 (with 36% of the total dated CEs). This reflects the big campaign of expurgation by a censorship committee that was in Mantua in 1595-1597. On August, 27th the bishop of Mantua appointed a committee of censors of the Jewish books in Mantua. Domenico Irosolimitano, determined by our analysis as the most dominant censor in the corpus, was the head of the Censorship Committee in Mantuain 1595-1597, and the author of <em>Sefer Ha-Ziquq</em> ( <em>The Book of Purification</em> )<a class="footnote-ref" href="#baruchson-arbib2007"> [baruchson-arbib2007] </a>. Sefer Ha-Ziquq is an index of forbidden Hebrew books specifying the corrections required for each of them. This censorship committee was active in the years 1595-1597 and censored hundreds of books and manuscripts<a class="footnote-ref" href="#baruchson-arbib1993"> [baruchson-arbib1993] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#baruchson-arbib2007"> [baruchson-arbib2007] </a>. The second wave in 1607-1629 (with 49.2% of the total dated CEs) corresponds to the activity of two prolific censors: Camillo Jagel da Correggio and Giovanni Domenico Carretto. Camillo Jagel was active from 1611-1629<a class="footnote-ref" href="#popper1899"> [popper1899] </a>. He began his activity as a censor in 1611 in Lugo (Segra, 1977-1980), which we quantitatively verified by detecting 26 censorship signatures with his signature with the year 1611 and with the place named Lugo. There are an additional 50 censorship cases with Camillo Jagel’s signature dated to 1611, but lacking any place reference. We inferred that these cases are based in Lugo as well. In 1613-1614 Jagel was in charge of expurgating Hebrew books in Modena and according to Francesconi&rsquo;s (2012) findings he also wrote censorship rules, lists of books to be censored and lists of passages to be erased<a class="footnote-ref" href="#francesconi2012"> [francesconi2012] </a>. After that, in 1619-1620, Jagel was active in Ancona<a class="footnote-ref" href="#popper1899"> [popper1899] </a>.</p>
<p>Giovanni Domenico Carretto served as a censor in 1607-1628, mainly in 1617-1619 when he was appointed to the position of censor of Mantua<a class="footnote-ref" href="#popper1899"> [popper1899] </a>. These two waves can be decomposed into a few micro-waves as shown by our findings (Figure 11).</p>
<p>Regarding the research question of the periods of censorship activity, the findings discussed above show that the censorship activity is not uniformally spread over time. There are periods of increased activity and periods of acalmernature. Whereas there is a direct correlation between the first wave of censorship (mainly 1595-1597 in Mantua) to the censorship committee appointed to at that same time in Mantua, there is no direct historical event that can be attributed to the second censorship wave. It is, however, known that during different Popes&rsquo; ruling periods, an inclination to force a stricter censorship policy or, on the contrary, to mitigate such activity was expressed<a class="footnote-ref" href="#raz-krakotzkin2007"> [raz-krakotzkin2007] </a>. In a broader perspective, it will be interesting to compare the trend of Hebrew literature censorship activity to the Church censorship of prohibited books in general. It might be discovered thatloweractivity periods are associated both with Jewish and general non-Jewish texts alike and can be attributed to different Papal periods.</p>
<h2 id="creation-events-dates">Creation Events&rsquo; Dates</h2>
<p>Overall, Hebrew manuscript creation during the last millennium was influenced by many factors. Examination of the distribution of the entire dated CRE set in Italy in Figure 4 (the grey bars), shows major changes in the rate of manuscripts creation over the years. This dataset comprises 3,213 CUs with a known creation place – Italy, and with a known precise or approximate creation time. In cases when only an approximate date (range of dates rather than a specific year) of the CRE was provided in the catalogue, the CRE was assigned a random year within the given range.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a sharp rise in the rate of manuscript creation in Italy in the 14th century compared to earlier times. Then, during the 15th century the manuscript creation rate is doubled. But in the 16th century we see lower rates compared to the previous century with a growing rate during the 1st half of the 16th century and a rather sharp decline in the 2nd half of the century continuing in the 17th century with a lowest rate point around 1700. From about that point, manuscript creation rates start to rise again with a pick of manuscript creation rate around 1800. From the middle of the 19th century we see an expected decline in creating new manuscripts.</p>
<p>In order to investigate a possible relationship between the different periods of high and low manuscript creation rates and the periods of censorship activities, we plotted the censorship activity histogram on top of the manuscript creation event histogram on the same time axis (see the red bars in<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). It can be noticed that the first declining period in CREs that starts around 1475 is not correlated with censorship activity as this have started only 75 years later, this decline is probably attributable to the invention of the printing press.</p>
<p>However, the second manuscript creation declining period which starts in 1590, right after the beginning of substantial censorship activity, might be influenced by substantial censorship activity in the closely preceding and following time periods (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). During the period of high censorship activity (the 41-year period between 1589 and 1629), Hebrew manuscript creation level in Italy was relatively lower compared to all other times in the period of 1375-1775.</p>
<h2 id="spatial-analysis-of-the-dataset">Spatial analysis of the dataset</h2>
<h2 id="censorship-events-locations">Censorship Events Locations</h2>
<p>When signing the censorship action, the censors, in most cases, added the date of the signature (mostly the year and in few cases the full date), but they very rarely (only in 71 cases, less than 2%) specified the place where this censorship had been performed and signed.</p>
<p>In order to complete the missing information on CEs locations we used ontological relationships between events, censors, time periods and locations and the information from the Pooper&rsquo;s list of Italian censors (Popper, 1889). In this list, Pooper recorded all the censors known to him in alphabetical order. For each censor he noted the years and places of his activity. For example, the censor Alessandro Scipione was active in Mantua in the years 1589-1590 and 1593-1598; Camillo Jagel was in Lugo in 1611, in Modena-Reggio in 1613-1614 and in Ancona in 1619-1620. We also used a newer study on the censor Domenico Irosolimitano that gave us more information on his activity as a censor<a class="footnote-ref" href="#prebor2007"> [prebor2007] </a>. Thus, given a CE’s censor name and date we could infer its location from the corresponding location in the Pooper’s list. As a result, we obtained places of censorship for 2,077 (53.9%) out of all the CEs in the corpus. Eight of the inferred places did not appear in the original list of 12 places that have been recorded in the catalogue: Ferrara, Milano, Monreale, Turin, Venice, Modena-Reggio, Ancona and the Papal States. In 1452–1796, 1814–1859 Modena and Reggio were part of the Duchy of Modena and Reggio. The place namePapal States, refers to a whole region which was at that time under the Pope&rsquo;s rule. In different periods this region included different parts of Northern Italy. Figure 5 displays the CEs geographic distribution on a map.</p>

</figure>
<p>As can be seen in Figure 5 the distribution of places of censorship events are spread out in various places in the Italian peninsula, especially in the north. This uneven distribution, which as stated above was dependant on the individual censor involved, also supports the historical knowledge we have about censorship activity in Italy. Much of the censorship was performed in accordance with the instructions of the church and local leaders and was the result of the activity of a number of censors who were active in certain places. The two places with the highest censorship events are Mantua and Modena.</p>
<h2 id="script-type-analysis">Script type analysis</h2>
<p>Another aspect of spatial analysis can be learned from the script types of the censored manuscripts. Hebrew manuscripts have been written in many scripts that varied from region to region, each with its typical script type. The Sephardic script, for example, is the typical script used by Sephardic scribes who worked within the Jewish community in the Iberian Peninsula. Since censored manuscripts were in the possession of the Jewish community in Italy, analyzing the distribution of their script types may provide new (quantitatively) perspectives of the extent of the transition of manuscripts from outside regions into Italy as well as on the immigration of non-Italian Jewish scribes who continued to write with the script type of their homeland and education<a class="footnote-ref" href="#beit-arié2018"> [beit-arié2018] </a>.</p>
<p>Five main branches of script types were proposed in the literature: Eastern script (which includes the Yemenite script and Persian script subtypes); Sephardic script; Ashkenazic script; Italian script and Byzantine script<a class="footnote-ref" href="#beit-arié2018"> [beit-arié2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#richler1990"> [richler1990] </a>. The catalogue named more than 70 distinct Hebrew script types. As a first step of the analysis, we have compiled a list of 17 script type classes with an additionalMiscellaneouscategory for the rest of the scripts: Ashkenazic Script, Italian Script, Eastern Script, Sephardic Script, Yemenite Script, Western Script, Byzantine Script, Karaite Script, Persian Script, Provencal Script, Samaritan Script, Ashkenazic-Italian Script, Sephardic-Eastern Script, Sephardic-Provencal Script, Sephardic-Italian Script, Sephardic-Western Script, Typewriter and Miscellaneous. Next, we classified all the manuscripts into seven unified script classes (ustypesfor short). For instance, the Sephardic unified script class was assigned to all manuscripts with variants of the Sephardic Script (e.g. Sephardic-Eastern script, Sephardic-Western script and Sephardic- Provencal script).</p>
<p>We then examined the distribution of the seven ustypes amongst 5,015 censored manuscripts and compared it to their distribution among a set of 72,233 non-censored manuscripts (overall, 77,248 manuscripts were created before 1700 as almost no censorship took place afterwards). The result of this comparison is depicted in Figure 6.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="" src=""

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It can be immediately observed that the Italian script type is the dominant one amongst the censored manuscripts (59.9%) compared to this script occurrence percentage (only 19.9%) amongst the non-censored manuscript created during the same time period. There was a significant difference in script type distribution between the censored and non-censored corpora, χ2(6)=118.21, p&lt;0.0001. This implies that a major part of the manuscripts in the possession of Italian Jews at that time were probably written by this community, namely, written in Hebrew with an Italian script type. This finding also strengthens the results of Beit-Arié that the Italian script was the most frequent one (55%) used in the manuscripts written in Italy before 1540<a class="footnote-ref" href="#beit-arié2018"> [beit-arié2018] </a>. These results can be explained by Italy being the centre of the Catholic Church on the one hand, as well as being a prominent centre of rich Jewish life and culture, on the other hand.</p>
<p>The presence of manuscripts written in other script types can be explained by manuscripts brought/bought by Italian Jews at different times as well by the use of these writing scripts by newcomer Jews. We show that 17.4% of the censored manuscripts were written in the Sephardic script which is an indication of the (mainly forced) immigration of Sephardic Jews into this region. This script type is found in only 14.0% of the non-censored scripts which strengthen the indication of a major transition of Sephardic Jews into Italy, compared to all other regions. Another well recognized fact confirmed from this comparative analysis is regarding Yemenite manuscripts. From Figure 6, one can infer that almost no manuscript written in Yemen arrived in Italy before 1700, as there are no censored manuscripts found that were written in the Yemenite script type. Thus, through analysis of script types we can indirectly identify migrations (or the lack of migrations) of Jews (with scribes among them) and partly answer research question number 1c (other parts of this paper discuss other types of geographic migrations, those of the manuscripts themselves, this time) see also in:<a href="#prebor2019">Prebor, Zhitomirsky-Geffet &amp; Miller (2019)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-the-locations-of-manuscripts-storage-events">Analysis of the locations of manuscripts&rsquo; storage events</h2>
<p>Another indication of the migration of manuscripts (albeit, through a later time span) is their current location. The original Hebrew manuscripts that are documented in the catalogue of the Department of Manuscripts and the Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts in the National Library of Israel belong primarily to public collections held by many public institutions (mainly academic or municipal/governmental libraries) or to private collections all over the world. As part of our research we wanted to shed light on the distribution of censored manuscripts in these institutions. We found that the Hebrew manuscript corpus is spread across 1,133 different institutions around the globe (see<a href="#figure07">Figure 7)</a>. 37.6% of them are stored in Israel&rsquo;s libraries (the majority are in the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem), 16.3% - in the United States and 15.7% are located in Russia.</p>

</figure>
<p>The largest portion of the censored manuscripts is still stored in Italy and the Vatican City: 35.6%. This portion is much higher than the portion of Hebrew manuscripts in general found in Italy and Vatican City out of all Hebrew manuscripts (5%). This is another indication of the censored manuscripts being primarily written in Italy, as well as an indication of a relatively high retention rate (i.e. archiving) of material of this nature in a close proximity to where it was originally written/possessed.</p>
<p>Yet, the majority of censored manuscripts were transferred over the centuries to institutions outside Italy as shown in Figure 8. Following Italy are the United Kingdom (20.5%) and France (10.3%). Israel is only sixth with a 5.5% share.</p>
<h2 id="subject-related-analysis-of-the-manuscripts">Subject-related analysis of the manuscripts</h2>
<p>Catalogue records include subjects from the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) (<a href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html">http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html</a>). Each manuscript record was assigned multiple subjects which were sometimes too specific.</p>
<p>In order to determine what were the main subjects of the censored manuscripts and whether there is a difference in the distribution of censored vs. non-censored manuscripts among subjects, we created a list of 13 general topics. The list of 13 subjects that generalize and group together some hundreds of subjects from the catalogue are: Popular Beliefs and Magic, Ancient Rabbinic Biblical Exegesis, Non-Legalistic Exegesis and Homilies, Science, Philosophy and Ethics, History, Mishna and Talmud Commentaries, Jewish Legal Texts, Liturgy, Bible and Commentaries, Kabbalah and Mysticism, Letters and Belles Lettres, Grammar. The Miscellaneous category includes Karaite literature, Jewish apocrypha, list of names, polemic, Gematria. For each censored manuscript we asked an expert researcher to assign subjects from the above list (thus, a single manuscript may have been assigned more than one subject).</p>
<p>In order to compare the distribution of the subjects in the censored manuscript corpus to that in the non-censored manuscript corpus, a random sample of 857 non-censored manuscripts written before 1700 was subject-annotated by our expert as well (with subjects from the above list only). For this analysis, we used a subset of 5,046 censored CUs that were created before 1700. The results are depicted in Figure 9.</p>

<p>We found significant differences in subject distribution for censored vs. non-censored manuscripts, χ2(7)=14.525, p&lt;0.05. The three major differences are in theKabbalah and Mysticism,Philosophy and Ethics, andLiturgythat were censored significantly more than other subjects. Subjects with percentages of 5% and lower are included in Miscellaneous in Figure 9.</p>
<p>The subject analysis of the censored manuscripts might shed light on the goals of the censorship activity. We found that the most censored subject wasKabbalah and Mysticism, 20% of the censored manuscripts belong to this subject (compared to only 14% of the non-censored manuscripts). This is not surprising since in the 16th century Kabbalah study became more widespread in Jewish culture and a debate arose over the printing of Kabbalistic literature. In this period, Kabbalah also attracted the attention of Christian scholars. Several Kabbalistic works were translated into Latin, and the interest and preoccupation with Kabbalah became wider. The main reason why Christian scholars expressed interest in Kabbalah is the similarity they saw in some of the foundations of the Kabbalah and the principles of the Christian faith. It is impossible to ignore the historical context of the debate over Kabbalah literature in the Jewish world in the period of the highest Catholic censorship activity when each body acted out of its own motivations and goals<a class="footnote-ref" href="#raz-krakotzkin2007"> [raz-krakotzkin2007] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#weiss2016"> [weiss2016] </a>. The second most censored subject is Philosophy and Ethics (17% of the censored corpus compared to only 11.4% in the non-censored corpus). The books of philosophy that deal with the core of faith and content that can harm Christian faith, such as Rabbi Joseph Albo&rsquo;s <em>Sefer ha-Ikkarim</em> ( <em>The Book of Principles</em> ), which has the most comprehensive censorship requirements in Sefer Ha-Ziquq<a class="footnote-ref" href="#prebor2003"> [prebor2003] </a>. The third subject with a significant difference between the percentage of censored and non-censored manuscripts is Liturgy. The ecclesiastical supervision of liturgical books, especially in the Ashkenazimahzorim(festival prayer books), was massive because they contained anti-Christian piyyutim (liturgical poems) and many expressions condemning the nations and the Christian faith<a class="footnote-ref" href="#benayahu1971"> [benayahu1971] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#raz-krakotzkin2007"> [raz-krakotzkin2007] </a>. The prayer books and themahzorimwere the most popular category in the libraries of the Jews of Mantua<a class="footnote-ref" href="#baruchson-arbib1993"> [baruchson-arbib1993] </a>. The percentages of the top-censored subjects partially correlate with the numbers of the required corrections for various subjects specified in <em>Sefer Ha-Ziquq</em> . The highest number of corrections (24 on average) in <em>Sefer Ha-Ziquq</em> is required for the Liturgy subject and Kabballah is ranked third (with 16 corrections required on average) following the ancient rabbinic biblical exegesis and non-legalistic exegesis subject (Prebor, 2003). In contrast, we found moreneutralsubjects that did not catch the censors&rsquo; attention, subjects withnon-problematiccontent. This includes Karaite literature, apocrypha, lists of names, polemics, gematria, letters and belles-lettres, science, popular beliefs and magic, and history.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-of-the-individual-censor-activity">Analysis of the individual censor activity</h2>
<p>The National Library cataloguers have identified 65 censors that worked in Italy between 1554 and 1775. Some of the censors were very active with hundreds of signed censorship actions, while others only appeared in 1, 2 or 3 CEs (censorship events). Figure 10 displays the counts of CEs for the top-20 censors (out of the 65) that were involved in at least 15 CEs.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As shown in Figure 10 the most active censor was Domenico Irosolimitano. Figure 11 displays his (and three additional most dominant censors’) activity on a timeline. Domenico Irosolimitano acted mainly from 1595 to 1602 (the pick year is 1597) and then again in 1612. His signature is found in 671 manuscripts (about 19% of all CEs) although only 378 (56.3%) of them has a date of censorship. Domenico Irosolimitano was not the first censor to act in Italy. He was preceded by several censors (Caesar Belliosus, Jacob Geraldini, Guido Menotius, Hieronymus Caralus and Laurentius Franguellus) that worked between 1554 and 1589, but each of these censors is responsible to only few dozens of CEs.</p>
<p>The censors’ frames in Figure 11 are presented in chronological order of their activity. Thus, the next censor (chronologically) is Luigi da Bologna who acted mainly between 1597 and 1602. Unlike Domenico Irosolimitano who has quite an exceptional pick year, the CEs of Luigi da Bologna are more evenly spread along its active years and are virtually all dated (326 out of 351). The third censor, Camillo Jagel, acted mainly in three years: 1611, 1613 (the pick year) and 1619. Camillo Jagel was responsible for 371 CEs (356 of them are dated). The fourth censor in Figure 11, Giovanni Domenico Carretto, acted mainly in 1617-1619 (the pick year - 1618). He is the second most active censor after Domenico Irosolimitano with 572 CEs (552 of them are dated).</p>
<p>The last frame in Figure 11 shows the overall censorship activity distribution over time. As can be observed, the CEs are not evenly distributed along the timeline. There were four main micro-waves of censorship activity in 1595-1602, 1608-1613, 1617-1619 and around 1626. These micro-waves generally match the activity periods of the four most dominant censors discussed above.</p>
<p>To complete the censor-related CEs analysis we performed a detailed breakdown of the CEs over time for the top eight places (including “the Papal States”) that have at least 30 CEs. The result is shown in Figure 12 (these places refer to 96.7% of the CEs with known or inferred locations: 2,009 out of 2,077). The figure also demonstrates the relative part of CEs that are associated with each of the most prominent censors (Domenico Irosolimitano, Camillo Jagel, Luigi da Bologna and Giovanni Domenico Carretto, represented with different colors).</p>

</figure>
<p>From Figure 12 it can be observed that in some places the censorship took place during a very short period (sometimes of one or two years), e.g. in Lugo, Ancona, Urbino and the Papal States. Censors’ movements in time and geographic locations can be traced as well, e.g. Domenico Irosolimitano (denoted by the red color in the chart circles) moved from Mantua to Ferrara and then to Rome, and Camillo Jagel (marked by the green color) moved from Modena-Reggio to Lugo and later to Ancona. Also, it can be noticed that Rome&rsquo;s CEs are mainly attributed to Domenico Irosolimitano, who was also a dominant censor in Ferrara and Mantua. Camillo Jagel is responsible for virtually all censorship in Lugo and Ancona. Modena-Reggio CEs are mainly executed by Luigi da Bologna with some noticeable contribution of Camillo Jagel (the late CEs in the 1640&rsquo;s are Girolamo da Durazzano&rsquo;s). Finally, Mantua&rsquo;s censorship was performed by Domenico Irosolimitano (in the early period until 1603), while more than half of the CEs in 1617-1619 are attributed to Giovanni Domenico Carretto. The CEs in the Papal States were almost entirely signed by Caesar Belliosus and in Urbino all CEs were signed by Antonio Francesco Enriques (not in the list of the top four censors).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This study presents the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the corpus of censored historical Hebrew manuscripts that survived through the centuries, particularly focusing on Catholic Church censorship in Italy. The primarily methodological contributions of this study include the following:</p>
<p>Definition of the generic data model of the Manuscript catalogue records.A new multi-dimensional ontology-based approach for historical data analysis from the geographic, temporal, actor- and subject-based perspectives.Utilizing previous studies results and ontological relationships for automated rule-based inference of over 50% of missing locations of censorship events.Comparative analysis of censored vs. non-censored manuscript corpora.Qualitative examination of the quantitative results in light of the extant literature and their historical and cultural context.</p>
<p>We found that the two centres of the most massive censorship in the history of Hebrew manuscripts were Mantua with 832 CEs and Modena-Reggio with 741 CEs. Also, rule-based inference helped discover eight censorship locations which did not appear in the catalogue. The time periods of the most intensive censorship activity in Italy were 1589-1602 and 1607-1629. The most active censors in Italy were Domenico Irosolimitano (671 CEs) and Camillo Jagel (572 CEs).</p>
<p>The distribution of the censored manuscript corpus differed from that of the non-censored corpus in several dimensions, e.g. by subjects, script types and storage locations. Furthermore, the following trends in censorship activity were discovered by our analysis:</p>
<p>A few big and micro-waves of censorship during the time period of the study;Geographic mobility of manuscripts, their creators and censors over time (the script types&rsquo; distribution reflects the dominance of the Italian script along with a significant transition of scribes from Spain);Current locations of the manuscripts (interestingly, as opposed to the entire corpus, censored manuscripts were less geographically mobile and are still mostly located in Italian libraries);Censorship influence on the Jewish literature in terms of applying more restrains on the “problematic subjects” (e.g. Kabbalah and Philosophy) and indirectly reducing new manuscript creation (our findings show a substantial retention in writing new manuscript during the pick periods of censorship activity).Repetitive censorship as a phenomenon (41% of the censored manuscript in the corpus were censored more than once, while only 2% of the censored manuscripts were collaboratively censored by two or more censors at the same time and location).</p>
<p>The above results show the power of a large-scale statistical analysis of the well-structured ontological data of the manuscripts. Firstly, the perspective of known phenomena was reinforced by a concrete number, for example, the migrations of Sephardic scribes to Italy. Also, the quantitative findings help determine whether a phenomenon is negligible as in the case of the small number of mutual co-censorship or substantial as in the case of repeating censorship. Secondly, new, previously not identified, insights were discovered. For example the relative restraint in creating manuscripts of “problematic subjects” manuscripts during periods of intense censorship.</p>
<p>This research has also some limitations, since Hebrew manuscripts are hosted in many different libraries around the globe, the metadata recorded in the catalogue is based mostly on microfilms or digitized images, and only in a few cases the cataloguers inspected the codices themselves. In addition, the catalogue of the Department of Manuscripts and Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts was created during a 70-year period by many different people. A large part of the catalogue was copied from catalogues of manuscripts in various libraries in other countries and contains only partial information. The rules of cataloging have changed over time. Therefore, there might be some mistakes in the catalogue data, but according to our arbitrary inspection, their proportion is relatively small and have no significant impact on the big picture of the studied phenomena.</p>
<p>In future work we plan to analyse more ontological event types, and extend the methodology for automated discovery and correction of catalogue mistakes as well as the completion of missing data.</p>

<p>This article describes a collaborative approach by faculty from Modern Languages and academic libraries at a public, land-grant research institution to design a digital humanities-inflected advanced French course on seventeenth-century French-language literature. Modern languages courses, although represented in digital pedagogy, are not as fully described in the literature as are disciplines like English and history. The approach to material in a Modern Languages department is inherently different from English and history in an anglophone context like the United States in that all subject matter is taught in the target language and developing linguistic proficiency in the L2 is the ultimate goal. Whether it be a language skills course focused on composition and grammar, a culture course, or a literature course, communicative language teaching necessitates a carefully scaffolded approach to maximize individual learners’ linguistic development and achieve programmatic learning outcomes. In Modern Language courses, there is a double concern, first on the course content itself and evaluating texts from thematic, theoretical, or cultural perspectives, and secondly on finding the means to do so linguistically in a language that is not one’s own. For example, reading a novel in the second language is a balancing act between developing an understanding of what is being said in the target language and how it is communicated. Additionally, the L2 classroom builds an immersive community of language users where the focus is on how information (language, concepts, texts) is processed, skills are acquired, and understanding is communicated amongst users of the target language. The inherently collaborative and cooperative nature of the L2 classroom, where meaning is built and evaluated in a community setting, parallels the skills and methods valued in the DH classroom. This focus on meaning making is consonant with approaches explored by new literacies in examining technology as a nexus through which community and meaning converge. While there are inherent parallels between these approaches, pedagogical texts that focus on integrating the digital humanities in, for example, the second-language context are few and far between<a class="footnote-ref" href="#pitman2017"> [pitman2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cro2020"> [cro2020] </a>. It is problematic that DH in the US has focused primarily and nearly exclusively on implementation in English-only environments given both the diversity of languages and experiences in the country itself, of the student populations targeted by DH in American higher ed institutions, and the purported global, public, open perspective indicative of work in DH<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gil2016"> [gil2016] </a>.</p>
<p>Steeped in a methodology that values collaboration, creativity, and digital literacy, DH is perhaps most successful in helping students to consider critically the potential for interdisciplinary, cooperative, and generative approaches to cultural and literary studies. This approach seems particularly apt for the L2 classroom. Indeed, both DH and Modern Languages may be characterized as inter- or transdisciplinary in nature with practitioners who draw from the realms of various subject areas like history, literature, art, philosophy, technology, design, etc.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#pitman2017"> [pitman2017] </a>. This echoes the often-interdisciplinary nature of work in an academic library. Academic librarians balance an expertise in information-seeking behaviors with the discipline-specific research methods of the teaching departments with which they liaise. They work with researchers to weave together information resources and methods from multiple disciplines, such as when guiding a historian through economic datasets. Additionally, academic librarians emphasize the critical evaluation and use of information and, increasingly, work with students and faculty as content creators as well as consumers<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kuglitsch2015"> [kuglitsch2015] </a>. L2 educators and academic librarians share a common mission in educating students to the degree that the students can exert their agency over research decisions. Students in an upper-level L2 class who are transitioning into careers or graduate degree programs need to be explicitly aware of themselves as creators of new scholarship. New literacies studies provides context for engagement with literature in an online environment. This multifaceted theory is used to study, among other things, reading online. Most important for an L2 and DH classroom, new literacies explores the ways in which reading, writing, and communicating using technologies reflect the communities that engage in those practices<a class="footnote-ref" href="#coiro2008"> [coiro2008] </a>. Knobel and Lankshear particularly focus on the “participatory, collaborative, and distributed, and less published, less author‐centric, and less individual ” nature of new literacies<a class="footnote-ref" href="#knobel2014"> [knobel2014] </a>, which strongly echoes DH practices. Given the similarities between the practitioners’ disciplines and the course goals, a DH-inflected class seemed a productive opportunity for engagement.</p>
<p>We introduced students to DH methods and tools that informed their ability to design and create a digital research project. The project, however, presented challenges for the professors. Firstly, at the time of the course, neither of us had any formal training in DH and, given the lack of institutional resources for the same, we undertook a “plucky” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#harris2013"> [harris2013] </a>DIY approach to learning the tools and designing assignments. We both brought some prior experience with DH to the course, and our pedagogy reflected our understanding that DH was not magical<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gianetti2017"> [gianetti2017] </a>but a practical means of engaging various approaches to literary analysis. In a previous course drawing on DH offered in fall 2016, the professor co-designed and taught a translation and archival project examining WWII correspondence wherein students developed a<a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/french-freedom-papers/index">Scalar site</a>to share information regarding the archive with interested members of the academy and the public.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> During that course, the librarian guided students in the research process<a class="footnote-ref" href="#antonioli2018"> [antonioli2018] </a>. The digital publishing project revealed the compounding complexities of introducing and completing a DH-project in a second language within the constraints of a sixteen-week class. While creating a tangible product was satisfying, our continued exploration of DH led us to reconsider DH as a series of experiences. The focus in <em>this</em> course, rather than digital publishing as in the previous experience, was to explore tabular data and visualization as a means of enhancing student approaches to textual and data analysis in the literature classroom. Rather than prioritizing the research essay or the final project as the ultimate expression of knowledge, we drew out the research process into an array of smaller, low-stakes assignments and encouraged students to experiment and propose means of analyzing the texts from a perspective informed by both digital and traditional approaches to the material. We were inspired by digital scholars like Katherine Harris (2013), who proposes a practical, hands-on, collaborative approach to implementing digital humanities in the classroom, and Jentery Sayers (2011) whose “tinker-centric” approach also calls for experimentation and freedom to play in the digital classroom. The challenge that had to be considered in design was that students had varying degrees of digital readiness. While technically in the generation commonly calleddigital natives, students were not, in fact, fluent in all technologies, as has been noted by others<a class="footnote-ref" href="#locke2017"> [locke2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#prensky2001"> [prensky2001] </a>. This meant that any DH activity had to engage and challenge students across the IT skill spectrum.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the course was successful in that students not only participated in and reflected upon processes for textual analysis and experimentation but examined ways for designing future projects. This necessitated also considering what their status as students at an institution of higher education afforded them in terms of access, and how they might continue and modify their approaches upon graduation in a professional context. The result was an inclusive and productive experience that underscored collaboration and equitable teamwork in the confines of the classroom to model future work in the field. It should be noted, however, that the output did not necessarily succeed in a traditional sense. Students designed a project that ultimately did not correspond to their expectations, but that moment of flux allowed for productive reflection on project design. Our approach mimicked what Croxall and Warnick have identified as “Failure as Epistemology” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#croxall2016"> [croxall2016] </a>, a pedagogical approach that recognizes and encourages what might be construed as failure in order to offer students an opportunity to reflect on the task, the process, and on questions related to design, user interface, and implementation. Leaving space for failure, for imperfections, for evaluating results that do not correspond to the perceived goals afforded learners the opportunity to develop resiliency and a growth mindset. In this case study, we analyze the productive spaces generated by a DHL2 pedagogy. Below we offer an overview of the pertinent DH and second language acquisition theories and pedagogical best practices that informed our course design; describe the course objectives and projects; and outline the impact that the convergence of DH, L2 pedagogy, and new literacies had on our approach.</p>
<h2 id="toward-an-inclusive-interdisciplinary-pedagogy">Toward an Inclusive, Interdisciplinary Pedagogy</h2>
<p>While there has been an increase in the attention given to DH pedagogy, termeddigital pedagogyby many practitioners, the number of resources dealing specifically with DH in the L2 context are scarce.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Several books offer varying approaches and practical advice with an overview of tools<a class="footnote-ref" href="#battershill2017"> [battershill2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#gardiner2015"> [gardiner2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#hirsch2012"> [hirsch2012] </a>and a recent issue of <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> (11.3, 2017) focused on DH undergraduate education. Even so, none of these sources explicitly describe how to implement a DH approach in the L2 classroom. This is particularly troubling given that DH is most effective from a pedagogical perspective when integrated and localized in a humanities course<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cordell2016"> [cordell2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#antonioli2018"> [antonioli2018] </a>. Pitman and Taylor (2017) note a similar lack of examples of DH in the Modern Languages and argue cogently for a “critical DHML approach” ; that is, a “hybrid Modern Languages and Digital Humanities framework” (para. 33) that capitalizes on the shared transdisciplinary nature of the two disciplines to examine how DH practices are inflected linguistically and culturally in a global context.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Global DH focuses on understanding the heterogeneous nature of digital practices across languages and cultures<a class="footnote-ref" href="#priego2015"> [priego2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#gil2016"> [gil2016] </a>rather than assuming all digital experiences and encounters parallel those of anglophone cultures, a critical consideration for an increasingly globalized world. This perspective parallels second language student training. Examining cultural artifacts from a critical distance and comparing personal experiences with those described in the L2 cultural landscape are core aspects of the World Readiness Standards developed by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#actfl"> [actfl] </a>. This is a practical skill that serves L2 students well as they encounter digital artifacts and consider how the digital is designed and utilized both in L1 (first language) and L2 contexts.</p>
<p>In addition to the lack of scholarship addressing combined approaches to DH and L2 pedagogy, many practitioners come to DH without the training and support offered in large DH centers in R1 academic institutions. DIY and individual ingenuity often guide approaches to integrating DH in the humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#harris2013"> [harris2013] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#roued-cunlife2016"> [roued-cunlife2016] </a>. Others note that DH is built upon “kludges” , workarounds, and the potential for failure; it is rarely an orderly process<a class="footnote-ref" href="#presner2009"> [presner2009] </a>. This reality conditioned our design, both in terms of the course as a whole and the project in particular. While conceptualizing the course, we were cognizant of the emphasis by some in the DH community that unless someone is building, or designing so that others can build, that person is not actually participating in DH<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2012"> [burdick2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ramsay2013a"> [ramsay2013a] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ramsay2013b"> [ramsay2013b] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ramsay2012"> [ramsay2012] </a>. We disagree. While building is an important aspect of DH, much can be gained through experimenting with existing tools, particularly for learners who may not have extensive backgrounds in coding. Additionally, the definition of building could be more widely and inclusively construed to reflect an attention to design and experimentation. This was the focus of our own intervention. A student in their first French class will not begin by reading a text as complex as, for example, the travel diaries of Jean Chardin.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Similarly, a student participating in their first DH experience will not reach the heights of a finalized DH project stemming from their own coding and design. We knew that students were not ready to code their own programs, so we adopted an intermediate approach, capitalizing on extant DH tools as Harris suggests<a class="footnote-ref" href="#harris2013"> [harris2013] </a>.</p>
<p>We asked students to map an aspect of seventeenth-century Francophone literature, using existing tools like spreadsheets and programs with mapping capabilities. Thus, they worked towards <em>building</em> a map. We demonstrated ways to discover and assess DH tools, drawing our pedagogical approach from our own experimental and self-taught backgrounds in DH. To that end, all DH work was situated in a computer lab. The computer lab ensured that all students had comparable computers and programs. Based on our work with college students, their access to technology is not equal and we did not want there to be a technology gap. While students were asked to do some brainstorming and exploration of DH outside the classroom, all design decisions and actual DH work on the project were undertaken in the classroom. In-class activities ensured that students had ample opportunities to share in ownership and ask questions, reducing the affective filter.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Moreover, we emphasized process-focused implementation in our instruction and design. Rather than presenting a completed framework for mapping, we broke down each aspect and walked through the decision-making process with the students. There was not one single way of achieving or defining success; rather, we recognized many such pathways and encouraged students to evaluate tools and research questions with open minds. Through this process, students explored the discrete aspects of a DH project. This resulted in their ability to apply the process of evaluating and questioning to their own future projects.</p>
<p>New literacies and academic literacies formed an important theoretical frame as we navigated the pedagogical and social implications of introducing students to DH within the context of literary analysis. Both theories emphasize the social aspect of literacy practices: the ways in which communities develop particular ways of reading, writing, and communicating, and the ways in which power, authority, and identity impact how individuals encounter and engage with those practices<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hui2018"> [hui2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#lea2006"> [lea2006] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#street2008"> [street2008] </a>. New literacies examines how technology, particularly online environments and their participatory features, impact literacy practices<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lankshear2011"> [lankshear2011] </a>. Academic literacies challenges educators to make explicit the literacy practices of a discipline, in particular how students will engage in those literacy practices within the specific context of an institution or a course<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lea2006"> [lea2006] </a>, a particularly productive perspective given the emphasis on the utility of explicit discussion of acquisition in L2 contexts<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bueno-alastuey2015"> [bueno-alastuey2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cohen2007"> [cohen2007] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#graham2011"> [graham2011] </a>. We wanted students to not just learn to use a technology, but to understand how that technology could be applied to their literary analyses as scholars of French literature as well as the impact of these mediums on their engagement with texts and artefacts.</p>
<p>In drawing out the social implications of DH, we emphasized the collaborative nature of the discipline through project design. We were influenced by movements such as the UVA Scholars Lab Charter (2016) and UCLA’s Student Collaborators Bill of Rights<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dipressi2015"> [dipressi2015] </a>that exhort creators to think carefully in terms of power structures and time constraints on students. To that end, we approached the material from an inclusive perspective, intending for the students to become fellow scholars, not laborers. We selected a joint mapping project which resonated with the course topic, “The Francophone World in the Seventeenth-Century” . All students in the class contributed to the same project and thus needed to agree upon a research question and an appropriate method to study, or map, that question. As educators, we forefronted discussions of applicable academic practices and how we were hewing to or deviating from those practices within the confines of our class. For instance, we knew the DH project would not be finished during this course. Rather than treat this as a research failure, we discussed the reality of research outside a course: it often takes much longer than the few weeks allotted a research assignment within a class and involves experimentation, failure, and reassessment. Engaging in a collaborative DH project afforded students the opportunity to practice their discipline’s literacies, including testing and challenging each other’s assumptions about what are important research questions and what methods to employ in order to investigate those questions.</p>
<h2 id="course-design-and-institutional-overview">Course Design and Institutional Overview</h2>
<p>This was a hybrid course designed for two populations: advanced undergraduate French majors and graduate students at the master’s level who needed a general, survey-like overview of the literary production of the seventeenth-century in the French-speaking context. The course, “The Francophone World in the Seventeenth Century” , examined the literary and cultural production of the period as well as the first phase of colonial expansion, its historical and cultural implications, and the way in which French national identity was constructed and represented in art and literature. Given the need to serve as a survey, the course material was organized chronologically. All materials were distributed through Canvas, the university’s course management system, using freely-available texts in the public domain, drawing from either the Bibliothèque Nationale Française’s online catalog,<a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/fr/content/accueil-fr/?mode=desktop">Gallica</a>, or<a href="http://wikipedia.fr/index.php?projet=source">Wikisource.fr</a>. In order to tease out implications of French identity, we read several works that dealt with the representations of other nations (ex: Spain in Corneille’s <em>Le Cid</em> ) and explored the significance of the same. Themes explored included travel and cartographic representations of space and emotion (for example, the <em>Carte de Tendre</em> of Madeleine de Scudéry) as well as the construction of both national and individual identity. Student work was carefully divided. In class we focused on both reflective activities and discussions of the literary texts (and various theoretical approaches thereto) as well as all DH work, presented as lab work that necessitated class time due to its inherently collaborative nature. Outside of class students completed readings, conducted research (bringing results to class), and reflected on work done in class. The rubric for the DH project (<a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>), comprising 15% of the total final grade, emphasized teamwork, professionalism, collaboration and the non-finite nature of the project itself, characteristics endemic to the best practices of productive members of the scholarly community and society as a whole.</p>
<p>Important in the course design was the institutional reality in which we teach. Ours is a large, land-grant university that plays a crucial role in extension activities across the state, related primarily to agriculture. The public nature of DH work is particularly beneficial as it coincides well with the primacy of public accessibility to research in our institution. Both of us believe strongly in the need to prepare students as engaged scholars and citizens who are ready to participate in a range of contexts upon graduation. With this in mind, an important aspect of this course was to explicate not only the ways in which public, digital databases facilitate access to early modern materials, but how digital archival methods are imperative to maintaining the same, and the professional opportunities that exist for those with this type of skill set. We wanted our students to see the type of research they started in this class as feasible outside the academy. Many students in the humanities will find jobs in K-12 schools, museums, libraries, small companies, and other organizations without access to the databases and software made available to them at a large public university. Digital humanities projects that leverage free or publicly accessible tools provide students with resources and skills that they can apply in a range of professional contexts. Additionally, many free or basic tools (like spreadsheets) serve as the foundation for more advanced digital tools that they may choose to explore at a later date.</p>
<p>The learning goals for the course reflected at once the subject matter objectives as well as the desired linguistic proficiency outcomes for this level of language learner. They were: (1) describe the works examined, their historical context and the importance of said works in relation to the themes, principle figures and events of the seventeenth century; (2) conduct literary analysis of and research into the works studied across a variety of genres (novel, drama, poetry, letter-writing, travel literature, etc.); (3) identify what are the digital humanities, describe the criteria of a DH project and create a digital map of one aspect of the course as designed and selected by the students; (4) demonstrate advanced spoken and written French skills (ex: compose a research paper, present one’s research findings professionally, contribute to course discussions in a professional and respectful manner, etc.). These goals parallel the student learning outcomes of our Modern Languages department and of the field as a whole, reflecting characteristics of advanced- and superior-level proficiency in all skill areas (reading, writing, speaking, listening) as defined by ACTFL (American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages) as well as enhanced cultural analysis and awareness. Through carefully scaffolded assignments, students achieved these outcomes. Each reading and project was organized along process-oriented lines; that is, the focus was to learn how to go about participating in the educo-professional goals of the course. Daily work included brief interactive presentations and sharing preliminary research on readings assigned, addressing questions raised by students regarding the texts, analysis of primary and secondary sources, drawing parallels between texts, and performative/creative activities (including imitating the writing style of authors, performing dramatic readings, or role-playing scenarios inspired by the readings). Given the lab setting of the course, we often made use of the Google office suite to share analyses, data collection, or creative endeavors.</p>
<p>One of the primary challenges we faced was the question of language. As an advanced French seminar, it was imperative that students work on developing proficiency in the target language. However, we had trouble identifying readily-available DH tools in the target language (Voyant Tools being a notable exception) because many DH tools are natively developed in English and the library sessions needed to be in English.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Additionally, we found it challenging to locate examples of DH projects that were French-language at a level that was accessible to students and illustrated concepts of mapping and literary analysis. Therefore, we had to think carefully about how to productively promote and facilitate linguistic development and acquisition in a range of contexts, including those sessions focused on DH. This was a rewarding aspect of the course design as it led to a practical skill-set focused on using the L2 in technology discussions that do not frequently present themselves in a French-language or literature course. Students learned to discuss literary/cultural topics and the use and applicability of digital tools in the target language. They negotiated with one another on questions of design and implementation, learning to discuss digital humanities both in the L1 in sessions with both faculty members present and in the L2 in discussions facilitated by the professor.</p>
<p>Throughout the course we walked through strategies for collecting data as well as designing and conducting research, focusing on scaffolding these complex processes and explaining the rationale for each of these steps. Students experience technology on a spectrum; what is inconsequential to one student can become an impassable barrier to other students, but some barriers can be reduced if instructors explicitly discuss them with students<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kearns2013"> [kearns2013] </a>. We broke down digital humanities projects in smaller steps so that they could be completed in-class in a communal and supportive setting, approaching all steps of the project as acts of co-authoring between the faculty and students. Such an approach embraces the tenets of the UCLA Student Collaborator’s Bill of Rights<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dipressi2015"> [dipressi2015] </a>and the UVA Scholars’ Lab Charter (2016) which recognize the potential for power differentials and the attendant labor issues that may arise in pedagogical settings.</p>
<p>Building on our discussion of labor and accessibility, we considered whether our students would have access to selected tools and resources after they completed their degrees and left the university setting. Rather than selecting software or programs that required subscriptions, we chose tools that were free, but did not have all of the features available from purchased software. This decision allowed us to focus on fundamentals that could be transferred across fields, rather than teaching the specific features of a particular application. We decided to focus on open access to tools and readings early in the course design. This foresight proved opportune as we found ourselves balancing the benefits of free and open access against hidden or unanticipated trade-offs. The course readings and all software were free and open access, with the exception of some databases and books available through the university library (e.g. MLA International Bibliography). Our commitment to public scholarship and open access often meant an increased labor burden for the faculty, either in preparing for the course or supporting the DH tools during the semester. Had we not begun planning the course months in advance, the reality of the time investment necessitated could have derailed our course goals. We discussed in class the ability to access materials regularly throughout the semester, a reality that surprised students as they had not considered the ramifications of researching outside an institutional context.</p>
<p>Despite a university subscription to the citation management system<a href="https://refworks.proquest.com/">RefWorks</a>, we decided to use<a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>which offers a free, basic account and supports multiple users collaborating in shared group libraries. These features supported our goal of introducing students to tools for public scholarship. A RefWorks subscription includes technical support, but Zotero does not. Our library only supported RefWorks at that time due to budget constraints. This meant that we assumed all troubleshooting for Zotero and students contacted us directly, without the option of using our library support services; this ad hoc support is common to DH endeavors<a class="footnote-ref" href="#posner2013"> [posner2013] </a>. We also hit an unexpected cost in regards to the group library we created in Zotero because it exceeded storage limits and requiring the group library owner to purchase additional storage. This proved a lesson in the limits offree. In the classroom, while the introductory day highlighted a range of reactions, from highly confident to somewhat tentative, students began using Zotero for this and other classes within days and reported finding the program both useful and easy to use.</p>
<p>Another risk of using free or open access tools is that they are reliant upon a person or institution providing continued access to and support of the tool. The stability of a tool is affected by continued grant funding or institutional support<a class="footnote-ref" href="#boyles2018"> [boyles2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#dhberkeley2019"> [dhberkeley2019] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#zhang2015"> [zhang2015] </a>. For instance, Google offered the program Fusion Tables as a data visualization app with mapping features. This relatively simple tool allowed us to use spreadsheets and metadata to map locations from the course readings. Multiple users could add and edit data simultaneously in a spreadsheet created in Google Sheets, allowing students to quickly build a shared dataset during a class session. The data was then connected to Fusion Tables and we determined what points to map and display. However, in late 2018, Google announced that Fusion Tables would be “turned down” as of December 2019 and that maps and other programs using it would no longer function<a class="footnote-ref" href="#google2018"> [google2018] </a>. Fortunately, most mapping tools we identified work with common csv files, which can be easily backed up and saved, even if Googleturns downSheets in the future. Creation and maintenance of a DH project necessitates ongoing access to appropriate tools. Whether that means paying an annual subscription or identifying, as we did, the most portable and common file type as your baseline for data sharing, depends on the resources available to the individual project managers.</p>
<p>The fact that many of the primary texts for the course were old enough to be out of copyright and in the public domain allowed us to assign free digital texts available through sites like Gallica, limiting expenses for students. One challenge to using texts in the public domain is the orthographic differences between early modern and contemporary printing practices. Where a critical edition will standardize spelling and grammar, there may be more variability in an earlier edition, adding complexity to the act of reading. This led to a consideration of the benefit of accessibility and cost-effectiveness for public domain texts against losing the critical apparatus, such as biographies, cultural contexts, and annotations, available in scholarly editions. Opting for the free texts inspired a productive discussion with students regarding the nature of the edition — the benefits and limitations of freely-accessible materials, the question of copyright, and the ways in which scholars put together a critical, annotated edition. However, this also meant that significant time was spent preparing introductions, designing activities that asked students to complete preliminary research prior to reading, and discussing strategies for interacting with texts (including identifying the types of things one might look for while reading that would be annotated in a critical edition). Counter to DH conversations of new ways digital texts can inform our understanding of a primary source<a class="footnote-ref" href="#latham2004"> [latham2004] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#webb2007"> [webb2007] </a>, we noted that digital texts, particularly the texts available in the public domain, were often editions that did not include the rich apparatus available in modern editions. By placing the French texts in a new, digital context instead of the accustomed print edition, we created an environment in which students had to think about the practice of literary criticism more consciously. Because these texts were not accompanied by a critical apparatus or annotated for readers, students had to take on the work of deciphering the text and clarifying textual references without the aid of a critical edition.</p>
<p>Flexibility was key in our conception of the DH project in order to facilitate a low-barrier of entry to students and reduce the affective filter. This practice ensured that there was always room for student ownership over the project. Because it was treated as a lab experience, students could call upon the group and the instructor to facilitate work and respond to questions. The value of this type of experiential, hands-on, skills-oriented approach was that it capitalized on active, engaged and reflective practices to promote careful consideration of DH implementation. For example, rather than front-loading the DH activities, creating a DH module, or otherwise focusing only on technologies, we paced the introduction of technologies to coincide with specific points in the research process. We introduced the concept of metadata early in the semester while learning to use Zotero, particularly the tag function, in preparation for creating annotated bibliographies. We revisited metadata when studying digitized maps and saving the maps’ details to Zotero, this time focusing on the unique data points needed to cite across media and generate a database. Later in the semester, we focused more fully on metadata in order to create maps using Google Fusion Tables and for our final project of mapping relationships in the targeted corpus.</p>
<p>Moreover, while copyright in relation to the primary materials used in class was not in question, significant time was devoted to the discussion of copyright and ownership of critical and individual scholarship as part of the library lessons and class discussions. Students, through DH, came to identify themselves as both content users who needed to acknowledge and cite sources and content creators contributing to scholarship. We explored copyright and authorship in a variety of ways, starting with a series of online lessons from the New Literacies Alliance (NLA)<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> project: <em>Question Authority</em> <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> , <em>Citations</em> , and <em>Scholarly Conversations</em> <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> (see these and all lessons at<a href="http://www.newliteracieslliance.org">www.newliteracieslliance.org</a>). The lessons are grounded in the Association of College and Research Libraries&rsquo; (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework). The Framework establishes knowledge practices and dispositions indicative of the critical evaluation of and engagement with information. The practices are organized into six core concepts, or frames, and each frame identifies how researchers, from novices to experts, navigate those practices. Most relevant to our work was the <em>Scholarship as Conversation</em> frame, as it includes concepts ranging from crediting others’ work to recognizing that any given avenue of research is part of a larger, evolving conversation. After these introductory lessons, we returned to the question of authority regularly during the course, recycling insights into authorship and discursive practices both thematically in terms of the texts studied and practically in relation to students&rsquo; own work.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, we focused on the nature of authority and authorship. Because the NLA lessons could be embedded in a course management system, we assigned them as homework to be completed prior to specific class periods when we would be introducing either related technology or research practices. Requiring the lessons as homework established a leveling platform whereby all students in the class were exposed to the same concepts and activities. They also had time to reflect on these concepts prior to in-class discussions about research as an ongoing process in which they could participate. Throughout the course, students were identified as content creators with the authority to participate in a larger conversation due to their adherence to scholarly practices in literature. Students gained familiarity with the research process and increased their confidence in their own voice. Because this course was designed to prepare students to conduct original research and analysis in seventeenth-century French studies while learning about diverse professional opportunities in the field, the NLA lessons were particularly effective in exploring how authority was constructed in various discourses. They offered an opportunity to bridge classroom activities with professional practices. We underscored a range of post-graduate experiences, from teaching to editorial to archival work in diverse cultural institutions. Additionally, we pointed to the transferability of the skills students acquired in the course to a variety of professional contexts across a range of disciplines.</p>
<p>External to the course planning was the serendipity of the community that developed among the students over the semester. Many of the students in the course had worked with us in prior courses. At least two students were in the prior DH-infused course referenced above. However, in this course, the students developed a back-channel communication method using an app where they could privately discuss the course itself. This turned out to be an immensely positive outcome as it afforded them a private space to discuss questions related to the course and express concern, frustration, or excitement and enthusiasm regarding the course content without the faculty involved. This was an organic development stemming from student initiative with the positive effect of creating and supporting the developing community. It also enhanced teamwork because the students became accustomed to discussing the class itself and the content in a less-formal setting and advocating for each other. For example, if a student had a concern but was nervous about emailing the professor, another student would volunteer and reach out to clarify the question and then report back. Another unexpected effect was increased enthusiasm regarding the materials studied; students were so keen on the material, particularly Corneille’s <em>Le Cid</em> , that they asked the professor to work with them to put together an abbreviated performance of the play in French for the campus community.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> These student-led initiatives further enhanced the course environment. There is not necessarily a way to implement or replicate this type of organic extracurricular contribution, but we believe that the model of collaborative engagement in the classroom did facilitate and favor these developments. In particular, the professor and the librarian modelled collaborative approaches in teaching the DH content and in exploring concepts such as new literacies, research strategies, and the history of the critical edition. This cooperative approach to instruction illustrated the collaborative nature of DH projects and of the research process and was reflective of the community building inherent in the L2 classroom. The students were developing linguistic proficiency and content mastery (both literary and digital) along parallel lines; while negotiating meaning, they negotiated alternative means of communication and engaged in critical and supportive ways with the material. The emphasis on collaboration in DH enhanced community building while the L2 focus on second-language production underscored opportunities for civic engagement, peer mentoring and advocacy, and developing empathetic, reflective practitioners. Students advocated for their peers, sought to ensure equal access to material and interrogated their own processes and the tools selected in a way that reflected the true potential of a global, linguistically diverse, DHML.</p>
<h2 id="mapping-collaboratively">Mapping Collaboratively</h2>
<p>Given the focus on cartography and its potential for encouraging considerations of space, authority, and representation, mapping was explored as both a form of visualization and a theme of study in the course. As the class read through the works, we made constant reference to maps, both contemporary and of the period, to render concrete the geography in play in the literary works. We also discussed the act of mapmaking and how modern advances in technology have deeply changed generative practices in the field of cartography. We curated and presented several DH mapping projects that the students explored in-class and we explored how to read different types of maps across varying mediums. As with the primary source texts discussed above, cartographic techniques in the seventeenth century compared to contemporary maps required learning new textual and visual cues. By focusing on digital maps and visualization techniques, students encountered not just new artefacts (maps) but artefacts that they could manipulate to change how they understood a culture or a primary text. Digital maps, such as ones we explored through the<a href="https://www.davidrumsey.com/">David Rumsey Map Collection</a>, allowed zooming and panning which in turn facilitatedclosereadings in geospatial contexts. The DH maps we explored contained features like timelines, connections between individuals, or notes imparting cultural context, and examined how these transform our interpretation of a text or map.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>In order to provide a sample of the potential for mapmaking, the professor and the librarian prepared a tabular datasheet of Jean Chardin’s voyages to and from Persia as the students were reading selections from his travel memoirs, <em>Voyages de Monsieur le chevalier Chardin en Perse et autre lieux de l’Orient</em> (ed. Philip Stewart, 2018). We then designed and presented a map using Google Fusion Tables as illustrated in figure 1, described our workflow, and discussed our project goals to students to illustrate method, collaboration, and design.</p>

<p>While we designed the class around mapping, we purposely stepped back from dictating what would be mapped and how. Cartography, and acts of mapping in particular, are potent opportunities to consider questions of authority and the influence that said authority can have. Maps have long served as defining documents that determine sociopolitical boundaries and impose the same on populations in a commanding fashion and without always permitting a plurality of perspectives on the question. Such concerns parallel those surrounding global DH practices. If one presents and practices solely in an Anglocentric vein, one is ignoring the import and the richness of a multilingual, multicultural approach to DH. With this reality in mind and paired with our own personal pedagogies related to student agency, we sought to avoid imposing an interpretation and instead encouraged students to assert their own perspective. New literacies affirms that new members to a community transform that community’s practices, sometimes with a nudge, sometimes with a shove<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lankshear2011"> [lankshear2011] </a>. Students had to feel free to experiment with voice, design, and scope, knowing that they had control over the project without feeling that they were going to be left alone without any instructional support. We reminded them that failure was an option, as it always is, but worked to reframe the concept of failure as a possible outcome in the natural workflow of any research project. In particular, we underscored that learning was the ultimate goal: learning how to use the tools, how to work collaboratively, how to design a DH project, and how to seek out support or answers when working in DH and research. Anyfailurewas just the first in a number of iterations that would be important for developing and strengthening their project and, ultimately, their research and project management skills. Striking this balance between scaffolded support and freedom of creation was imperative because we both believed that this course and the DH project served as a steppingstone into careers. We explicitly discussed their agency in the DH project and how that could relate to future endeavors. As professionals and scholars, the students would be expected to demonstrate initiative and problem-solving.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when it came to designing their own mapping project, students conceived of mapping in a far more abstract way than the rather concrete examples we had illustrated and catalogued. Our conception of mapping was highly geographic whereas the students’ was ultimately more a visualization of the text. In a subsequent class period, we asked students to break into small groups and propose their own ideas for a mapping project, largely construed. They had three questions to discuss: (1) What is the scope and objectives for the project? (2) What texts should be included and why? (3) What information will we need to begin the project? Students were encouraged to think widely and each of the three small groups proposed vastly different conceptions: one group proposed creating a map that connected both the tangible (physical locations) with the intangible (themes, concepts) in a range of works studied; another group proposed elaborating the Chardin map we had begun; another proposed exploring the writing of Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de Sévigné, a writer known for her extensive correspondence. These projects referenced tenets implicit in global DH by exploring multiplicity of perspective and voice, ranging from intimate women’s accounts to public conceptualizations of nation and identity in a broader Francophone context. These ideas were outlined on a shared Google Doc. Students then presented their ideas to the class and were asked to think about it overnight. In the following class period, students shared their views on pros and cons for each project proposal and ultimately decided on a more “intimate” project — rather than attempting to map the texts from the course as a whole, they wanted to explore the epistolary network of Madame de Sévigné and tease out whether there was a connection between place and theme reflected in the social networks.</p>
<p>The students made an independent and practical design decision conditioned by their own interests. Additionally, where we had conceived of geography in terms of demonstrating a larger physical reality, students were intrigued by what could be termed thegeography of the individual, more abstract constructions of the same in the vein of the <em>Carte de Tendre.</em> <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> We anticipated students would plot texts onto a map to visualize the Francophone world in the first phase of colonial expansion, perhaps conceptualizing the overarching course theme through mapping. The student’s approach was a tapestry focused on relationships around a single author. Perhaps our project example focused on Chardin served as an impetus for them, but students chose to explore on a micro-level Sévigné’s social circle rather than on the macro-level of course readings across time and space. This led to particularly productive reflections on the nature of social and epistolary networks: who were the recipients? what were the relationships between Sévigné and her correspondents? where were they when they wrote or received the correspondence? what was the nature of the correspondence and how were epistolary and social practices inscribed in the texts? That is, it was common practice to read these letters aloud&ndash;what stylistic choices hinted at these practices? Finally, what was the import of geography and how could mapping help to visualize this polyphonic network and set of relationships?</p>
<p>Students raised these and more questions as they grappled with the reality of transforming these observations into more precise data points that could ultimately be mapped and visualized digitally. We discussedtranslatingtheir questions and answers into tabular form. This was a particularly productive moment because it touched on design and project scope while helping students to clarify and isolate data that was truly necessary for their primary objectives from information which might serve as secondary considerations later in the project. It should be noted that this was the culmination of our introduction to digital tools and methods and occurred in the latter third of the semester. Because we purposely scaffolded pieces of this process into earlier assignments (i.e. methods for data collection, the importance of metadata and appropriate categorizing of information, etc.) students were able to draw upon and then recycle those methods independently. Students quickly recognized that the initial scope of their project, given Sévigné’s prolific letter-writing habit, was imposing and pondered how they could efficiently extract the data points from the thousands of pages of letters. This opened the window to return to the question of editions raised earlier in the semester during discussions of manuscripts and printing practices. We brought in the critical edition of Sévigné’s correspondence by the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade to discuss the paratextual material made available through the preparation of the critical edition itself. Importantly, this included an appendix that indexed the letters by correspondent, date, and location. With this appendix, students discovered many of the data points that they had previously discussed and encountered additional data points that arise in letter writing that they had not considered.</p>
<p>Students then embarked on the final DH activity, entering the data points into a spreadsheet and mapping the data. We created the columns and headings in advance to maximize in-class time, using categories discussed in the prior class, and during the class we reviewed the role of metadata (in this case the column headings) in the mapping process as well as modified the spreadsheet as necessary. Due to the collaborative features of Google Sheet, each small group entered unique data points while observing how their colleagues entered the material (see figure 3 below).</p>

<p>At one point, work came to a halt when one student raised the issue of how data points like correspondents’ names and days of the week were being entered. The class briefly discussed abbreviations and entering French terms rather than English, or vice versa, because they realized common data points would not be mapped appropriately if they were not uniformly entered. We did not participate in this conversation, making space for the students to independently resolve the issue, which they did, admirably. This moment encapsulated many of our learning goals, particularly in observing the students interact as professional colleagues interrogating their methods for meaningful data collection and the implications of collaborative research design.</p>
<p>Once students established their controlled vocabulary and entered a few dozen data points, we shifted to Google Fusion Tables and selected the locations from the letters for mapping. At this point, the whole room deflated when everyone realized that the only locations on many of the letters compiled into the spreadsheet were Sévigné’s two residences. We loaded the csv file into Stanford’s<a href="http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/">Palladio</a>and explored how the relationships could alternatively be mapped (see figure 4 below), reinforcing the importance of identifying tools and methods that support the research question.</p>

<p>While the class did not culminate with a glorious map, we nonetheless observed the students’ transition from a class of, well, students, to a community of scholars. This started as early as the first month of classes, when students could see each other’s Zotero folders and began recommending sources to each other. Their back-channel communication resembled the ways colleagues manage workplace issues, including advocating for each other. The DH aspect of the course opened the whole class to a greater breadth of research in modern languages. While independent research projects can result in one student learning the value of critical editions or using a visual medium to interrogate a text, this often occurs within a bubble comprised of the student and the professor. There is little opportunity to delve into nuances or to test the implications from several perspectives. The DH project shifted students from solo practitioners experimenting in discipline-specific practices into a community of scholars debating, critiquing, and building upon those practices in collaborative and engaged ways. This communal model of research in the DH classroom echoes thelaboratory modelwherein researchers test ideas within a shared space before public release. Humanities faculty seeking models to mentor student research may find this idea of the classroom as a micro-DH an attractive approach, with the potential to develop over time as a humanities laboratory that cumulates research from class to class and eventually support individual student research. DH did not present an easier route, but a different route to critically analyzing literature in the L2 context.</p>
<p>Through our interactions with the students during and after the course as well as through student evaluations and feedback, we noted a range of outcomes that paralleled our own goals for the course: (1) the skills students learned were highly transferable, not only to future professional contexts (which are intangible to many students) but immediately, to other class projects (i.e. the final research essay, research they were conducting in other disciplines from the social to the hard sciences); (2) students became comfortable with and conversant about the critical apparatus surrounding course topics; (3) several students chose to continue and pursue more advanced research topics in the discipline (for example, one student worked with the ML professor on a more advanced topic the following semester, resulting in a published paper); (4) students developed a more profound understanding of what labor and work in the humanities encompass (i.e. teaching, research, and service; research across humanities disciplines, particularly in literary criticism; and what work looks like in various settings, be they institutions of higher learning, museums or public archives, or academic or commercial presses); (5) students in the class formed an engaged community of scholars who assumed roles as active project designers and researchers. These outcomes underscore the vast potential a global, multilingual DH-inflected approach informed by new literacies represents.</p>
<p>Creating flexibility for student-driven decisions and troubleshooting capitalizes on characteristics of digital pedagogy that correlate nicely with L2 pedagogy, but we did not fully embrace one aspect of digital pedagogy: the exhortation to reach a larger public. While in a previous course the focus was to share results publicly and openly, a key component to DH<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sample2013"> [sample2013] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sample2011"> [sample2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#spiro2012"> [spiro2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#antonioli2018"> [antonioli2018] </a>, in this course we sought to extend the traditional definitions ofpublic. We propose that, particularly within a pedagogical context, DH project work might be conceived ascommunalin addition to or in contrast withpublic-facing. That is to say, we encouraged students to present results within their own scholarly community, recognizing that while it would not result immediately in public-facing, open scholarship it would represent an important step towards that ultimate goal. Moreover, we pointed out that the initial work done here would be shared with future courses in the field, thereby building a wider community beyond their own class that would share in the findings. At each step we laid the foundation for students to engage in public scholarship in the future by emphasizing open source, open access technologies and discussing implications of authority and access in the public sphere, outside the confines of an academic institution.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-expanding-notions-of-community-success-and-labor-in-a-global-dhml">Conclusion: Expanding Notions of Community, Success, and Labor in a Global DHML</h2>
<p>We believe that exploring DH in the L2 classroom allows a productive space to examine notions related to linguistic and cultural power-dynamics. The more diverse the approaches to DH, the more diverse DH itself becomes. Moreover, exploring digital tools as cultural products with their attending sociocultural contexts in terms of language, costs, and access, challenges the inherent monolingualism of the field and diversifies approaches to and perspectives on DH, DH tools, and DH methodologies. In the L2 classroom, even students for whom English is their first language, the language of technology can be as new and unfamiliar as a second language. Exploring the digital humanities from a scaffolded perspective that calls attention to the nature of cultural power dynamics and the ways in which information is transmitted and interpreted enriches the field immeasurably. For example, students in this course engaged in the participatory nature of new literacies, DH, and L2 practices that emphasized taking advantage of interactive tools to reconsider primary source texts while elaborating that work within a global context. Taking a micro approach to community capitalizing on the iterative, reflective, project-oriented practices inherent in L2 pedagogy and new literacies theories resulted in a course design that drew attention to larger theoretical concerns within DH such as definitions of public and open-access in various contexts, the import of productive failure, and the potential and importance of collaborative practices with shared authorship among all participants.</p>
<p>In terms of community building, students formed their own scholarly community through both in-class interactions and private social messaging apps, creating forums to discuss the academic literacies they encountered within the context of a specific class. These interactions promoted students’ agency and reconceptualized their roles in scholarly endeavors, enabling students to recognize their own potential as authoritative voices. This student-to-student tutelage reflected thetriangularlearning and social constructivism observed in other DH projects in L2 environments<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mahony2014"> [mahony2014] </a>. We consciously worked to encourage students to feel comfortable engaging in disciplinary discursive practices from which they often feel excluded because they lack a perceived authority and agency therein. We were particularly gratified when students chose a research path distinct from what we had anticipated, illustrating how new participants to an academic literacy transform the conversation and practices, and solidifying that they felt invited to the table to participate. The true value of informing DH and L2 pedagogy with a new literacies perspective is to focus on inclusive discursive practices.</p>
<p>In addition to students developing their own authority and confidence, we worked to broaden their notions of success. We sought to help students understand more fully the “nuts and bolts” of research design and project management, particularly in terms of defining scope and setting realistic timelines. The average semester-long course can promote false notions that research projects can be begun and completed within three to four months. Additionally, not every research endeavor ends in a neatly packaged product. The reality, as researchers in the humanities know, is vastly different. This project helped to promote patience, in terms of design and results, and with themselves as researchers. Students began to understand that they could (1) participate in multiple projects, such as traditional papers and DH explorations, simultaneously and (2) that not all projects may be defined and designed in the same way. Throughout, we emphasized the importance of process over product, giving the students space to design and conceptualize without the pressure of needing to have a predefined deliverable ready by end of term. This approach diverged from facile notions of success in terms of completion, focusing instead on the potential for failure as a productive practice<a class="footnote-ref" href="#croxall2016"> [croxall2016] </a>that may be just as important to the ultimate research process as success and would lead to successful completion. This perfectly encapsulated and modeled a scholarly conversation — students shifted roles from readers to researchers, claiming an active part in the work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, re-defining success permitted constructive discussions regarding labor and the division of the same, both in DH research initiatives and in terms of designing such a course. Boyles, et. al. (2018) note the precarity of digital humanities in academia, both in terms of those who support DH initiatives (often contingent labor from across various departments in the institution or faculty/staff whose work flow differs substantially from the teaching faculty) as well as the students who are participating therein<a class="footnote-ref" href="#boyles2018"> [boyles2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#anderson2016"> [anderson2016] </a>. While theutopistideals of collaborative teamwork and inclusive practices have been variously espoused and critiqued in DH scholarship<a class="footnote-ref" href="#price2013"> [price2013] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#presner2009"> [presner2009] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2012"> [burdick2012] </a>, as Anderson et. al. have noted, “very little deals with students as collaborators or active participants in the projects whose success depends, to a great degree, on their labor” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#anderson2016"> [anderson2016] </a>. It was imperative, in our course conception and project design, that students be fully engaged and understand the potential and ramifications of work in the digital humanities. This, in large part, was why we ensured that all DH project work took place in the confines of the classroom where we could work alongside students. Additionally, students were invited to participate in this sphere as fully contributing members, involved in design and work equally. While the impetus for creating the DH project was faculty-led (and noted in the syllabus as part of the course goals), the project itself was a cooperative effort that attempted to correspond to the best practices, including clearly formalizing group structure and work, treating project management and training as part of the course content, encouraging student-led design in the project, and recognizing that projects need not have the same finite deadlines as other coursework<a class="footnote-ref" href="#anderson2016"> [anderson2016] </a>. Underscoring the process as product itself greatly facilitated this work.</p>
<p>Alongside varying expectations for success, we also promoted building a community that recognized at once the multiplicity of voices in the room and reflected on the impact of discipline-specific practices in a global, multicultural context. In our approach to instruction, we capitalized on the benefits of zones of proximal development<a class="footnote-ref" href="#vygotsky1978"> [vygotsky1978] </a>through extensive group work, characteristic of L2 pedagogy to promote language acquisition. This focus on collaborative practices necessitated students prioritize listening to and learning from their peers. Such an approach valorized diverse perspectives and experiences that may diverge from a student’s own worldview. Students’ prior experience with this type of group work in the L2 classroom facilitated transitions to the intensely collaborative work that characterized our classroom and are imperative to a global DH. Working with a global DH in mind contributes towards developing a nuanced, egalitarian, and collaborative work ethic that is particularly apropos to multicultural and multilingual interactions that are increasingly common in the workplace. Not only did we encouraged all participants to practice agency and advocacy through their shared scholarship, these competencies reflect our institutional land grant values. This evokes the core mission of the Modern Languages department, namely to “prepare a linguistically competent and culturally aware citizenry poised to live and work in an increasingly global and diverse society, in accordance with Kansas State University&rsquo;s land grant mission” (Dept. of Modern Languages n.d.). These values, namely the ability to advocate and participate equally in a multicultural and multilingual environment, are at the base of global DH. Adopting this type of approach, however, is not without consequences; namely, that of the time involved. We worked to ensure that integrating a global DH approach into the seminar would not overwhelm students and that the project itself would not exceed the limits of obligation for any one member of the team. This ensured a balanced approach to student labor that ultimately corresponded to our course goals and expectations.</p>
<p>One aspect of labor that must also be considered is that of the faculty members involved. Designing and implementing this scaffolded approach was a time-consuming process. We met and corresponded regularly outside of class both prior to and during the semester to consult on design, reflect on student progress, and modify where necessary. A nimble approach to DH projects demands that faculty prepare for multiple research scenarios depending on student interest and design. This involved investigating more tools and resources than were ever introduced or used in class. Our own level of collaboration increased over the course of the project as we progressed from initial conversations about a specific DH project and became more invested in a DH-inflected course. As others have noted<a class="footnote-ref" href="#harris2013"> [harris2013] </a>, the inherent time and labor necessitated by the faculty embarking on such an approach is at times staggering. While it may be true that future collaborations will be less time-intensive because we designed all the materials and assignments for this course and the approach from scratch, a significant portion of time was spent in meetings to reflect on progress in the course and consider how best to address questions raised and desired outcomes. This type of reflective practice would be necessary whenever implementing this approach.</p>
<p>It is true that this approach requires time and patience, two commodities that are not easy to come by, particularly as one reflects on one’s institutional profile and the inherent requirements of faculty therein. However, there are concrete benefits to a DH approach informed by L2 practices and new literacies, both in terms of student learning and faculty development. We found that the student learning theories and practices that already informed our discipline-specific work with students (such as best practices in second language acquisition and new literacies perspectives) remained highly relevant to our implementation of DH pedagogy. Rather than supplanting or overshadowing disciplinary-specific discursive practices, we found that DH methodologies put those practices into greater relief, forcing students and faculty to more consciously explore processes that can become unconscious or habitual. Moreover, this type of experimentation and collaboration is immensely beneficial, particularly if made part of faculty’s research, teaching, and service agendas. While larger institutional attitudes regarding expectations for tenure remain challenging to modify, we who are tenured faculty can shape our scholarship practices to record our own work in collaborative pedagogical endeavors, thereby lending credence to initiatives to widen what counts asscholarship.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Digital environments are characterized by a kind of writing wherein fragments are constantly reorganized and reformatted in order to establish new structures of meaning. Sentences and information are in fact intended to be recovered, recontextualized, “rearchived” (in Frenchredocumentarisation)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#zacklad2010"> [zacklad2010] </a>in collages or pastiches sometimes produced by algorithms. These new types of writing can recall a long-standing literary form: the anthology, a tradition that Milad Doueihi argues represents the spirit of contemporary digital culture<a class="footnote-ref" href="#doueihi2011"> [doueihi2011] </a>. In this way, digital environments are able to provide a new structuring of content, to such an extent that we believe the anthological form bears a structural resemblance to the digital. The anthological form in fact proves to be difficult to characterize and categorize: its constitutive heterogeneity creates tensions relating to the idea of a literary “oeuvre” as a unified whole. The first example of an anthology is often identified as the Garland of Meleager, a collection of epigrams composed in the first century BC which represents the primary source of what is now called the Greek Anthology. This composition is, in itself, the anthology of anthologies: it is the foundation of an anterior collection, that of Simonides of Ceos (556-468 BC) dating from the 5th century BC. The Garland of Meleager thereby constitutes the first collection of epigrams to be united in a single volume, prevailing as the canonical model of the literary genre that is the anthology.</p>
<p>The Palatine manuscript assembles epigrams produced over the course of over sixteen centuries, written by more than one hundred authors. Almost all collections of Greek epigrams have been preserved through a single manuscript: Codex Palatinus 23, kept at Heidelberg<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cod2018"> [cod2018] </a>. Understanding the diversity of such a collection becomes increasingly relevant over time. If we cannot consider the Anthology to be a unified “literary” work, how do we describe it? What are the possible ways that we can read a text produced in antiquity? To answer this questions, we have initiated the project of a “collaborative edition” of the Anthology which operates outside of the confines posed by mainstream digital scholarly publishing. Within this project, we consider that the characteristics of the digital environment, new forms of writing, and notably the concept of editorialization discussed in this article are best equipped to conceptually unravel the nature of the anthological form, in particular via the establishment of an open and collaborative edition.</p>
<p>The collaborative approach thereby benefits from digitally open and collaborative methods allowing an international community to read, interpret and comment on the Palatine manuscript according to the theory of collective intelligence<a class="footnote-ref" href="#levy1994"> [levy1994] </a>. Since the Palatine manuscript is a collection of heterogeneous texts, it is difficult to fully grasp the collective values, beliefs, attitudes, and postures – herein referred to as collective imaginaries or topoï – associated with the Anthology. In this way, traditional publishing methods limit our capacity to interpret collective imaginaries – common and perceived “truths” – associated with the text. Our digital edition moves away from singular interpretations of the Palatine Anthology (PA) and proposes to understand the plural meanings and possibilities associated with reading the classical epigrams.</p>
<p>In this article, we will present the theoretical basis and editorial foundations (observations regarding the contemporary editorial milieu) adopted by the PA project, as well as the methodological and technical processes put in place to meet the particular challenges posed by our objectives. Therefore, this article aims to outline our academic posture regarding a digital approach to antique literature, an approach which enhances both the interpretative possibilities – for both scholarly and non-scholarly readers – of the Palatine manuscript. Our main thesis is that the Anthology should not be considered a unified, uniform and coherent body of work. Rather, it assembles various texts produced over many centuries by numerous authors and thereby represents a dynamic and open collective imaginary. Before clarifying this thesis, we will first describe the problematic nature of the definition of the Anthology and then outline the complex history relating to the publication of the PA.</p>
<h2 id="greek-anthology-a-problematic-definition">Greek Anthology: a problematic definition</h2>
<p>One of the first concerns a publisher encounters when he or she examines the textual material of the Greek Anthology is how to define it. One could define the Greek Anthology as a collection of epigrams compiled in the 10thcentury. In fact, the editions of this text are based on the Codex Palatinus 23, a manuscript dating from around 940 AD, stored in the Palatine Library of Heidelberg (leaflets can be found at the BNF under the symbol Suppl. Gr. 384), discovered in 1606 by Claude Saumaise. This collection is based on a previous Anthology, composed about a half a century prior by Constantin Cephalas. To date, it is understood that most of the epigrams found in the Codex Palatinus 23 derive from the work of Cephalas<a class="footnote-ref" href="#aubreton1968"> [aubreton1968] </a>. Therefore, the Greek Anthology fundamentally refers to the Palatine Anthology. Most current editions (Paton, Waltz) enable us to understand the complexity of the corpus. Indeed, in addition to the fifteen books of the Anthology that correspond to the division of the Codex Palatinus 23 that can be found in the 1916 Loeb edition produced by Paton (or in the 1972 Belles Lettres edition produced by Waltz), these two sets add volume XVI under the title of Appendix Planudea. Maxime Planude had composed his own Anthology in 1301<a class="footnote-ref" href="#aubreton1968"> [aubreton1968] </a>, and it includes some of the epigrams of the Codex Palatinus 23 to which other epigrams not present in this first manuscript were added.</p>
<p>We therefore consider the Greek Anthology an object reconstructeda posterioriby modern editors who, in reconstructing the Greek Anthology, attempt to give a somewhat exhaustive account of the Greek epigrammatic. But we must go back a little further in our chronology to the work of Cephalas, whose work is based on earlier sources, the most notable of which are the Garland of Meleager, the Garland of Philip of Thessalonica and the Garland of Agathias of Myrina, dating from the 1stcentury BC, the 1stcentury AD, and the 6thcentury AD, respectively<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gutzwiller1997"> [gutzwiller1997] </a>. In accordance with contemporary taste during the Hellenistic period, Meleager, who composed the first collection of epigrams together in a single volume ( <em>Anthologie Grecque. Première Partie. Texte établi et Traduit Par Pierre Waltz</em> 1928, XI), says, “to weave” with these texts “a wreath of flowers” (literal translation of the Greekanthologia). In the preface of his crown - which we find at the beginning of book IV of the Codex Palatinus 23 - Meleager lists these poets by comparing each of them with a flower:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Μοῦσα φίλα, τίνι τάνδε φέρεις πάγκαρπον ἀοιδάν; / ἢ τίς ὁ καὶ τεύξας ὑµνοθετᾶν στέφανον; / Ἄνυσε µὲν Μελέαγρος, ἀριζάλῳ δὲ Διοκλεῖ / µναµόσυνον ταύταν ἐξεπόνησε χάριν, / πολλὰ µὲν ἐµπλέξας Ἀνύτης κρίνα, πολλὰ δὲ Μοιροῦς / λείρια, καὶ Σαπφοῦς βαιὰ µέν, ἀλλὰ ῥόδα</p>
<p>To whom, dear Muse, do you bring these varied fruits of song, or who was it who wrought this garland of poets? The work was Meleager&rsquo;s; he produced this gift as a keepsake for the illustrious Diocles. He wove in many red lilies of Anyte, and many white lilies of Moero; a few of Sappho, but they are roses.</p>
<p><a class="footnote-ref" href="#paton1916"> [paton1916] </a></p>
<p>The material harvested by Meleager is composed of texts, the first of which can be traced back to poets from the 6thcentury BC (eg Sappho) or the 5th(Simonide, one of the first poets to consider the epigram as a literary genre) up to Meleager himself, who inserts into his work several texts from his hand<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gutzwiller2007"> [gutzwiller2007] </a>. Following the anthological contributions of Meleager, scholars continued over the centuries to add new epigrams to the old material. The Anthology became a growing compilation that surpassed the temporal constraints usually relating to literary work. Some texts are, literally, epigrams. That is, they are short and sometimes witty texts designed to be inscribed on objects, tombs or buildings<a class="footnote-ref" href="#pfeiffer1968"> [pfeiffer1968] </a>. Most epigrams are, however, poems that appropriate the epigraphic format by subverting their function: they are not real inscriptions, but poems that stylistically imitate the first inscriptions. Indeed, it could have been as early as the 1stcentury BC that the epigram became a recognized literary form. The popularity of this form exploded during the Hellenistic period when great literary figures like Callimachus and Asclepiades became prolific epigrammatists<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gutzwiller1998"> [gutzwiller1998] </a>. We can only understand the meaning of this literary form by considering it as a living and moving material, as an open oeuvre, one which has resonated among many literary imaginaries across different societies and throughout different periods in history, from archaic Greek culture to Byzantine society. Over the centuries, epigrammatists have written their own texts as per the tradition developed by their predecessors<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> .</p>
<p>As a whole, the Anthology initially assembled texts from the 6thcentury BC, only to add, in the 10thcentury AD, more than a hundred poets - including several anonymous poets - who wrote in the interim period, that is over the course of sixteen centuries. The editorial history of the Anthology is, as we will now outline, extremely complex and layered.</p>
<h2 id="critical-editions-of-the-anthology">Critical editions of the Anthology</h2>
<p>Since the discovery of the manuscript in Heidelberg by Claude Saumaise in 1606, many critical editions of the Anthology have been published.</p>
<p>Claude Saumaise – who never achieved his goal of producing a critical edition of the Palatine Anthology –, produced a collation of the P23 manuscript and composed a set of critical notes. These notes were used for the first time at the end of the 18thcentury, in order to conceive of the PA prior to its edition. Thus, between 1772 and 1776, Richard-François-Philippe Brunck produced the first complete edition of the Palatine Anthology in his <em>Analecta veterum poetarum Graecorum</em> , which he published in three volumes. In this edition<a class="footnote-ref" href="#tyrtee1772"> [tyrtee1772] </a>, the epigrams do not follow the order of the original manuscript. Instead, they are chronologically grouped according to the author&rsquo;s name. Friedrich Jacobs took over Brunck&rsquo;s work a few years later and arranged the epigrams according to the same structure, grouping them into 13 volumes under the general title <em>Anthologia Graeca sive, Poetarum graecorum lusus ex recensione Brunckii</em> . This is his first critical edition of the Anthology, published in Leipzig between 1794 and 1814<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jacobs1794"> [jacobs1794] </a>.</p>
<p>Between 1813 and 1817, Jacobs edited a second critical edition of the Anthology, this time arranged in three volumes<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jacobs1813"> [jacobs1813] </a>. The first two volumes include the epigrams of the Palatine Anthology, arranged in the order of the Palatine manuscript, to which are added the appendix of Planude&rsquo;s epigrams, as well as 394 pieces from the ancient authors. In the third volume, the critical notes and indices have been arranged. This second edition was based on the careful collation of the text, although its compilation was not based on the Palatine manuscript, but rather on the copy of J. Spaletti<a class="footnote-ref" href="#waltz1928"> [waltz1928] </a>.</p>
<p>Along with these philological works, critical studies of the Anthology and its manuscript tradition continue to multiply. Johann-Friedrich Dübner integrates such research in an edition published between 1864 and 1877, borrowing and developing different aspects of Jacobs&rsquo; organization method. He thus edited the epigrams of the fifteen books of the Palatine Anthology, and added a Latin translation, an Appendix Planudea, and an appendix gathering the epigrams of the ancient authors, under the general title <em>Epigrammatum Anthologia palatina cum Planudeis and appendix nova epigrammatum veterum ex libris and marmoribus</em> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dubner1864"> [dubner1864] </a>.</p>
<p>It is precisely during the 19thcentury that philology is endowed with stable scientific methods. 20thcentury philologists working on the Anthology claim to represent these same critical currents. Two major critical editions then emerged: that of WR Paton, published by the Loeb Classical Library in 1916-1918, and that of Pierre Waltz, published in <em>Belles Lettres</em> and continued, after the death of the philologist, by Jean Irigoin, Robert Aubreton and Felix Buffière. This edition (1928-1980) comprises thirteen volumes.</p>
<p>WR Paton&rsquo;s edition relies on the manuscript of the Palatin Anthology as well as that of the Planude Anthology, demonstrating how certain philological variants, observed in the other sources, differ from the conceived text<a class="footnote-ref" href="#paton1916"> [paton1916] </a>. It also includes the lemmata in the conceiving text and accompanies its edition by an English translation of the epigrams. Pierre Waltz also wished to include, in his edition of the Greek Anthology, not only the epigrams of the Palatinus as well as those of the collection of Planude, but also the epigrams drawn from the papyrus and the metric inscriptions. It therefore takes into account the whole manuscript tradition of the Greek Anthology, but prioritizes the Palatinus manuscript text in order to establish the epigram texts contained in this collection. In the critical notes accompanying his text, he comprehensively outlines the philological variants<a class="footnote-ref" href="#waltz1928"> [waltz1928] </a>.</p>
<p>The UTET editions in Turin have recently published a last edition made up of the work of Fabrizio Conca, Nario Marzi and Giuseppe Zanetto, published in three volumes between 2005 and 2011 that propose an Italian translation of the text<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conca2005"> [conca2005] </a>. This complex and layered history – filled with additions, republications, translations, and scholarly comments – demonstrates the need for alternative editorial means of presenting the Anthology.</p>
<p>These different critical editions all agree on the prevalence of the Codex Palatinus 23, choosing it systematically as their main source. At the same time, they wish to synthesize the Greek epigrammatic work, including the annex pieces. Thus, philologists try to account for the character both of the abundant and scattered collections of epigrams and their editorial work to show the complexity induced by the anthological nature of these texts.</p>
<p>Strangely, none of the existing critical editions systematically conceive the text of the scholia<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> despite their abundance in the Palatine manuscript. These scholia play a fundamental role in the text, especially when we consider the anthological form: scholia organise and enable a rich set of internal references by building intertextuality within the anthological material. They relate epigrams that mention the same characters (for example, a scholium may inform the reader that two love poems were written to the same person) or connect the epigrams of the same author. Let us take, for example, the scholia attached to the epigram 5.19 “τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἔρωτ (α) ἀλλόκοτον” : while the same author refers to this epigram, it also contains intertextual ties to another epigram. They also provide precise information on the composition and constitution of the anthological corpus, specifying the sources of the textual material. For example, the very first scholia of Book IV explain that the first poem of the book is the preface to the Garland of Meleager, but it also gives us a number of biographical details. It is still the scholia that teach us that the source of the Codex Palatinus 23 is the Anthology of Constantine Cephalas. Last but not least, scholia establish thematic links between different epigrams, thus drawing a relating of topoi whose influence has proven vital in both artistic and literary history. We understand, therefore, how scholia – a feature heretofore neglected by publishers of the Anthology – complement our understanding of the contents and meaning behind the texts, as well as the essence of the anthological structure. This approach proposes that we understand the anthological structure as a format which supports and displays an entire literary imaginary.</p>
<h2 id="the-anthological-imaginary">The anthological imaginary</h2>
<p>In our project, we consider that the Anthology should not be considered as a coherent and self-contained literary work but as a document relating to a dynamic and open collective, literary imaginary: as an open text, the PA performs via its intertextual structure and contemporary readers ought to be able to appropriate this structure through referential associations. This hypothesis is the reason for our pursuit of a new, digital means of presenting the Anthology, and it draws on three considerations:<br>
As the above described history of the Anthology demonstrates, the form – orgenre– has evolved over centuries and is thus, intrinsically, a continually evolving collaborative work.In terms of content, it is fundamentally characterized as heterogeneous (in terms of its form and themes, in particular).The purpose of the Anthology is to refuse semantic closure — that is, to enable the works that it compiles to continue to find new meanings, to establish links with one another over time according to various methodologies and approaches.</p>
<p>By examining the history of the Anthology, its philogical complexity, we observe that it is less a unified work (or aunit), than the outcome of a stratification of texts. Over a hundred poets across more than sixteen centuries<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cameron1993"> [cameron1993] </a>have contributed to its creation. In fact, in terms of content, the Anthology is essentially heterogeneous, testifying to the personal preferences and subjectivity of each contributor. Alongside the few “real” inscriptions (here we adopt reference to the etymological origin of the termepigram) appearing in the Anthology, there are innumerable epigrams created from scratch to integrate into the Anthology, which is therefore transformed in literary play. On the formal plane, the elegiac couplet (the epigrammatic privileged form) coexists with other metrical forms (iambic trimmers, dactyl hexameters, etc.). The range of themes is spread from erotic epigrams to Christian epigrams, bearing witness to developing societal tastes and concerns over time.</p>
<p>The texts establish a dialogue with one another over time. This dialogue, which weaves in and out of the work, complements the Anthology&rsquo;s structural heterogeneity<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gutzwiller1998"> [gutzwiller1998] </a>. Thanks to the scholia in particular, we observe the highlighting of topoi that not only reappear throughout the manuscript, but have also had a strong resonance in literature, from medieval troubadour songs to contemporary music and Hollywood movies. Consider, for example, the topos of the Carpe diem, very present in Hellenistic epigrams like those of Asclepiades (see AP 5.85), later taken up in the <em>Odes</em> of Horace, and whose traces are also found in the poetry of Ronsard ( <em>Sonnets for Hélène</em> ) and Laurent de Médicis ( <em>The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne</em> ), in the songs of Brassens ( <em>Saturn</em> ), or even in the movie <em>Dead Poets Society</em> . Thus, the Anthology essentially refuses any closure and, on the contrary, encourages a continual expansion and development of the text and its references. Even today, the Anthology remains an open text that internally refers to other pieces present in the manuscript, while also echoing external texts potentially related to the material of the Codex Palatinus.</p>
<p>The material of the Anthology still inhabits our literary topoi far beyond the explicit references made to its texts. To publish them implies an attempt to account for its circulation over a millennium, the diversity of the material involved as well as the richness and heterogeneity of the references between the texts.</p>
<p>For a modern reader, we believe that it is important to be able to represent the various (internal and external) connections that the works of the Anthology establish with one another. In other words, in order to edit this rich and complex anthological imaginary, we must be able to represent and do justice to the plurality of meanings possible. But how do you represent to a modern reader such richness and complexity? The traditional methodologies and experiences of scholarly publishing do not seem appropriate to harness and express the complexity of the Anthology. Indeed, while it is quite possible to contextualize the text of the Palatine manuscript and to make a critical edition of it, it is very difficult to give an account of the overall cultural value of this material, and in particular of the impact it has had on collective imaginaries over the centuries. In other words, we could, of course, make a critical edition of the Codex Palatinus, but it is impossible to do this in the case of the Greek Anthology because this work abounds in references, contexts and implications. The interpretative limits of the Anthology are endless.</p>
<h2 id="editorialization-an-open-collaborative-and-interactive-solution-to-editing-the-anthology">Editorialization: an open, collaborative, and interactive solution to editing the Anthology?</h2>
<p>How does one publish the anthological imaginary? In order to answer this question, it seems appropriate to refer to the theory of editorialization. This theory proved to be useful in understanding how the dynamics of production and the circulation of contents, in a digital environment, help us interpret and propose an edition of an object such as the Anthology. Editorialization then became a founding principle of our editorial approach.</p>
<p>The termeditorialisationhas come to be used in the last decade by French-speaking scholars to refer to the production and circulation of content in digital environments<a class="footnote-ref" href="#vitalirosati2018"> [vitalirosati2018] </a>. However, it is sometimes difficult to grasp the exact meaning that researchers attribute to this concept. To give a precise definition, we can say that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editorialization is the set of dynamics that produce and structure digital space. These dynamics can be understood as the interactions of individual and collective actions within a particular digital environment.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#vitalirosati2018"> [vitalirosati2018] </a>In other words, editorialization is an open and collective process, which produces contents and visions of the world that organize our relationship to reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sense, the theory of editorialization can help us to understand the essence of the Greek Anthology as an alternative to traditionnal edition. Indeed, this textual material is an open and collective process, which is not unified but has nevertheless played a large role in forming and transforming the social imaginary relating to literature. The arrangement of editorialization mechanisms found in the Codex Palatinus is one possible way to understand anthological culture<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crane2009"> [crane2009] </a>. The following three aspects of the concept of editorialization have proven to be the most relevant in fulfilling our goal:<br>
Editorialization is not a closed process, but an open and dynamic one, where content that circulates in digital environments can always be used, modified and reused, to fulfill another function. This is exactly what characterizes the process of conceiving the PA prior to its edition, as we have analyzed it.Editorialization is a collective process, as is the Anthology, and because neither has a single author, the result is textual material made up of a multiplicity of voices and hands.Editorialization is a process that cannot be controlled because it frees itself from its own instigators and goes beyond the objectives leading to its creation in the first place.</p>
<p>It is on these theoretical foundations that we have built the collaborative publishing project of the Anthology. We have specifically designed a digital environment in which scholarly publishing is conceived as a form of editorialization: an open process, based on the interaction between different teams of researchers and other contributors (a contributive model) and which invites each participant to appropriate the textual material and modulate it or use it according to his or her own needs and wishes. These interactive priorities move well beyond the scientific requirements of a traditional scholarly edition.</p>
<h2 id="methodology-and-technical-aspects">Methodology and technical aspects</h2>
<p>From a methodological and technical point of view, we decided to set up a digital infrastructure that best reflects the theoretical hypotheses previously described. The desire to leave the canonical paradigm of scholarly publishing led us to make three strategic choices:<br>
Create an open database queryable via API.Allow a free structure of data (that allows data to be structured in many ways), to avoid imposing a predetermined epistemological approach.Encourage communities to collaborate on heuristic and editing tools.</p>
<p>The choice of an open database, searchable by an API, participates in the very nature of the anthological model, which ultimately relies on an aggregation of fragments selected by an author or a compiler. In the same way, we chose to structure data in JSON rather than XML / epidoc. This decision may seem to break the rules of the digital critical edition, but we believe that it stimulates the appropriation and reconfiguration of the contents, in harmony with the spirit of the Anthology. The static structure of the JSON, unlike the tree structure of the XML / epidoc, allows the contributor/editor to reorganize data according to different paradigms of interpretation.</p>
<p>Finally, just as the poets of the Anthology have done over the centuries, our model aims to stimulate exchanges and interactivity between contributors. We have created a digital editorial environment based on a collaborative and interactive logic, in order to establish a community of contributors. In particular, we have launched a vast educational project, in partnership with secondary schools teaching the Ancient Greek language. Supervised by their teachers, several groups of pupils translate the Greek text and publish it online. This project has many educational advantages:<br>
language learning;text analysis;learning digital publishing tools.</p>
<p>In addition to being a unique learning opportunity for the secondary student, the work produced by this less scholarly community facilitates the task of the scientific community by supplying usable contents for research. In addition, this collaboration is based on a strong epistemological positioning, since it erases the boundaries between the work of the scientific community and the contribution of novices. This part of the project resonates entirely with the theoretical and methodological positioning recommended in the Digital Classics<a class="footnote-ref" href="#terras2010"> [terras2010] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#blackwell2009"> [blackwell2009] </a>. As explained above, the very idea of “truth” of the text - that is usually based on a critical or genealogical approach - is not, in the case of our editorial project, an objective to be achieved. On the contrary, we seek to bring out the pluralities of perception of the textual material - because it is this plurality, at the origin of the collective imaginary woven by and around the Palatine Anthology, which constitutes, according to us, the essence of this text.</p>
<p>Thanks to its multiple tables, our database should allow us to pursue and complete the philosophy specific to the anthological genre, highlighting not only the intertextual connections - as an hypertextual relation, the possibility of any text of a return to another older text<a class="footnote-ref" href="#genette1982"> [genette1982] </a>, but also the networks of references built through the centuries, between the anthological texts and any other cultural or artistic object<a class="footnote-ref" href="#coffee2012"> [coffee2012] </a>. On our contributive platform, we find different translations. For example, we include a word-by-word translation faithful to the literal meaning of the text as well as a literary translation prioritizing its more poetic and figurative connotations. The translations are provided in several languages, mainly English, French and Italian. These different translations emphasize the importance of the appropriation of textual material. The Anthology and its contents have also proven capable of crossing time and space: its temporal and spatial circulation was enabled during the Hellenistic period by the fact that the Greek, as ‪Koiné dialektos, ‬was a universal language. That is to say that we deem it essential that translations be included so that the text may continue to circulate across several academic disciplines and places.</p>
<h2 id="description-of-the-editorial-infrastructure">Description of the editorial infrastructure</h2>
<p>Our infrastructure can be described according to three aspects:<br>
The relational database;The API;The different displays made from the API.</p>
<p>The database is built from the notion of entity, the epigram, in a repository aligned to the Perseus URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier) which constitutes the textual unit. Each entity corresponds to an epigram, understood as an anthological fragment and not as a textual manifestation attached to a specific manuscript or edition. This entity then takes shape in various textual manifestations. In our database, we can therefore associate each entity with several pieces of information and, first and foremost, with text versions of the epigram. Our epistemological model leads us to consider the different versions of the Greek text in the same set of possible translations. All these versions can be aligned with each other, thanks to a software editor that we have developped and which allows us to compare the Greek texts and the different translations. Each entity can be attributed to one or several authors, and can be tagged by keywords, which include information on the themes of epigrams, on literary genres, on the characters mentioned, or on the reading path established by users. Each entity can also be linked to one or more scholia, either the original Greek or a modern translation. Entities can also be associated by any API users with iconographic material or other texts that echo with the corresponding epigram. This possibility allows us to underline as previously defined the “weak links” between the text and artistic works, in order to enrich the anthological material. If we go back to the example mentioned above, we can insert, in the database itself, the links between the epigram of Asclepiad - which evokes the topos ofCarpe Diem- and the famous <em>Ode</em> of Horace or the poem of Laurent de Médicis. Finally, each entity can be aligned with the facsimile of the corresponding manuscript.</p>
<p>The database is exposed in JSON through an API, which makes it possible to carry out queries to display the data, as well as to enrich a preexisting entry.</p>
<p>The API obviously allows several forms of appropriation of textual material. As an example, in the case of our project, we propose a “scientific display” , which makes it possible to visualize all the information available on the base, a public display, which offers a navigation by thematic reading paths (these paths being conceived of in order to narrativize a group of epigrams), and finally, a Twitter bot which posts epigrams on the social network, associating them with the corresponding image of the manuscript.</p>
<h2 id="expected-benefits">Expected benefits</h2>
<p>Our project is currently in its third year of development. We have since witnessed the enthusiasm of various communities (scholarly, educational, contemporary readers) involved in the editorial activity of this project. The project thereby resonates beyond the academic sphere. The potential for appropriation of the Greek Anthology by contemporary readers is therefore very strong and proves the vitality of this material in contemporary culture. This is a work of the Digital Humanities. We adopt, in particular, the approach prescribed by the Digital Classics as it relates to the critical editorialization of ancient texts. We thereby wish to promote, through the use of digital tools, an appropriation of such texts by contemporary readers<a class="footnote-ref" href="#solomon1993"> [solomon1993] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#bodard2016"> [bodard2016] </a>. Given its current development, we can identify four expected benefits of the project:<br>
Although our project is primarily an experiment in Digital Classics and our publishing model is a prototype, we are convinced of its potential as a reusable model for other projects because it develops and improves the preexisting philological approach and embraces the nature of the anthological form.By opening the users of the API to the world of Greek epigrams and related literary or artistic objects, our project enables contemporary readers to not only appreciate, engage with, and enjoy ancient texts, but to participate in contributing and in developing collective understandings of these texts. In addition to being exposed to new meanings associated with the Greek Anthology, users are able to demonstrate how literary topoi develop and adapts across centuries. The API imitates the notion of a collective imaginary because both insist on plural meanings, development, dialogue and the mutual influence of ideas.By renewing the classic philological approach, we have shifted the boundaries between scholarly practices and those of the novice, both in terms of production and dissemination of editorial content. The boundaries between scholar and novice now must undergo reconsideration.It goes without saying that our project not only contributes, but also promotes the advancement of knowledge, therefore serving the interests of the scientific community. The role that the novice plays in our approach takes into account the way in which our database can also be structured in scientific ways. In particular, our project contributes to improve the Perseus database (our partner) by contributing further information, as it will collect, in xml / epidoc format, all the texts, translations and alignments produced, as well as other relevant information, thanks to queries on the API (at the moment, Perseus does not have, for instance, French, English and Italian translations of the epigrams, nor the Greek text of the scholia)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crane1992"> [crane1992] </a>. In addition, the project contributes to the production of semantic data thanks to the alignment of our data with linked data repositories<a class="footnote-ref" href="#romanello2009"> [romanello2009] </a>. The API queries Wikidata ad hoc to retrieve existing data (for example, information about an author or a city). All the data collected on the platform will then be reinserted on Wikidata via the API.</p>
<p>In accordance with the principles of the Digital Classics and Digital Humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#schreibman2016"> [schreibman2016] </a>, we are contributing to encyclopedic projects by playing an active role in the pooling of knowledge.</p>

<p>In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, troupes of English players began leaving London to perform their plays for foreign audiences. They took plays from Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Decker, and other Elizabethan and Stuart playwrights and performed them across the Continent, as far east as modern Poland, as far north as Sweden. While early performances were in English, they were quickly translated and adapted in these foreign contexts, made to fit the various social and religious milieus of performance.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#drabekandkatritzky2016"> [drabekandkatritzky2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#bosman2016"> [bosman2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#haekel2004"> [haekel2004] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#schrickx1986"> [schrickx1986] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#limon1985"> [limon1985] </a>. In the process, the plays were cut down, reworked and adapted in various ways, even sometimes reworked as puppet theater, and the play texts associated with these players, left in a “mutilated” state, were objects of critical derision for most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cohn1865"> [cohn1865] </a>.</p>
<p>With recent critical interest in cultural exchange, however, scholars have begun to recognize this theater as an “unexampled success” in the “history of cultural relations.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bosman2006"> [bosman2006] </a>. Precisely because the players became so adept at navigating various regions, their theater as an institution can reveal practices of performance and cultural translation, features of transnational early modern cultures, and the earliest reception history of Shakespeare and his contemporaries on the Continent. In response to this growing interest, the (few) texts associated with this theater have begun to be newly edited and translated, made available to a wider audience of students and scholars. I am currently producing a digital edition of <em>Fortunatus</em> , one of the plays in the 1620 collection <em>Engelische Comedien und Tragedien</em> , for <em>Digital Renaissance Editions</em> . The wider availability of these texts will not only be useful for students and scholars, especially considering the critical turn to transnationalism, it might also help corroborate a reevaluation of the theater. And yet, as I hope to show, precisely because of the extemporaneous and adaptive performance style of these players, the surviving texts often misrepresent the practice of the theater; indeed, the static form of the printed playtext explains much of the critical derision directed at this theater, some of the misunderstanding of the travelers’ art.</p>
<p>In this essay, I argue that the digital medium might be more congenial to the adaptive theater practiced by early modern players, and I suggest how we might encode characteristics of the theater into a digital edition. More broadly, I attempt to show that creating a digital edition of the travelers’ <em>Fortunatus</em> can help us better understand the success of this theater against its critics by illuminating the episodic and modular characteristics of their performance.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-of-editing-the-early-modern-travelers">The Challenges of Editing the Early Modern Travelers</h2>
<p>Even more than most early modern dramatic texts, the playtexts associated with the early modern traveling theater present difficulties for the editor. Not only are they quite rare, but they are, arguably, even further from performance than the texts associated with the London stage for two interrelated reasons: their episodic and extemporaneous style. The travelers’ performance of any play could differ significantly in different contexts. When the players performed a play in a new location, they would not only rework lines or scenes, but add or cut entire episodes. Scholars have shown, for example, that popular scenes from different plays might be stitched into a new performance; or that a play’s content could change significantly depending on a region&rsquo;s official religion<a class="footnote-ref" href="#williams1990"> [williams1990] </a>. Early performance sometimes staged only scenes from plays, strung together for the audience&rsquo;s entertainment, and this suggests that, at least early in their travels, these players viewed the plays not as coherent literary works but rather storehouses of engaging episodes. With the plays and pieces of plays staged dozens of times across the Continent, each, perhaps, differently, it becomes difficult to establish aTraveling Players’ Fortunatus.</p>
<p>We might, then, turn simply to the surviving text, since evidence of each individual performance is likely unrecoverable, letting the edition stand as a record of this cultural object rather than attempting to capture the players’ performance of <em>Fortunatus</em> more generally. Even here, however, the printed text misrepresents the players. The players’ style was not only episodic, but also extemporaneous, heavily reliant on clowning and nonlinguistic elements of the theater. They were famed acrobats and musicians, also frequently afoul of authorities because of the bawdiness of their performance style. While, as we will see, the <em>Fortunatus</em> associated with these players attempts to capture this extemporaneous style, the static form of the codex proves incapable of accurately representing the players.</p>
<p>As the remnants of this theater, we are left with a relatively small number of texts, often related in complex and partial ways to multiple English and German dramatic and prose works. These works insinuate the variable, but also, of course, irrecoverable plays that were actually staged by these English players on the Continent, but they are also calcified in print, producing final and static versions. A storehouse of these texts was printed in 1620, <em>Engelische Comedien und Tragedien</em> , likely compiled by Friedrich Menius<a class="footnote-ref" href="#freden1939"> [freden1939] </a>. It contained German translations and adaptations of a number of English plays, including <em>Titus Andronicus</em> , <em>Fortunatus</em> , biblical histories, and seven interludes featuring the popular stage clown of this theater, Pickelhering.</p>
<p>Because most of these texts are notoriginalsbut rather adaptations, usually part of complex and multifaceted story traditions, recapturing the relationships between the original play in London and the travelers’ adaptation can be almost impossible. <em>Fortunatus</em> demonstrates this complexity well. We have records of three performances of <em>Fortunatus</em> by the traveling players, each associated with the troupe of John Green, one of the most prolific early travelers. The first was performed at Kassel in the winter of 1606/7. Shortly thereafter, the players staged the play in Graz in 1608 before Maria Magdelina, documented in her letter to her brother, the Archduke Ferdinand. The last performance, also by Green’s troupe – though Green had perhaps died shortly before this performance – took place in Dresden in 1626<a class="footnote-ref" href="#limon1985"> [limon1985] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#schrickx1986"> [schrickx1986] </a>.</p>
<p>Of course, most archival records of the travelers’ performances do not include a list of plays, and Green’s troupe performed across Northern Europe, likely staging <em>Fortunatus</em> dozens of times. Even the three performances we know, moreover, place the Fortunatus myth in starkly different religious and cultural contexts. Moritz’s court at Kassel was among the first that welcomed the English players, and the duke was well-known in England in the period as a champion of Reformed Protestantism and a diligent internationalist. At Graz, on the other hand, the players worked in a counter-Reformation state and performed before a Catholic princess. These venues raise interesting questions about the text: for, as scholars have shown, troupes would regularly adapt the religious messages depending on context<a class="footnote-ref" href="#williams1990"> [williams1990] </a>. How might the Fortunatus text have changed in the hands of Green before a Reformed Duke like Moritz and a staunch Catholic like Archduchess Maria Magdelena? Jerzy Limon has suggested, based on Green&rsquo;s choice of patrons, that Green may have been Catholic himself, and thus even the translation involved in an English Catholic player (Green) adapting a playtext written by a fairly radical internationalist Protestant (Thomas Dekker) based on a medieval Catholic proto-novel suggests the religious complexity of this cultural exchange – only amplified in the more overtly religious texts common to this theater<a class="footnote-ref" href="#limon1985"> [limon1985] </a>. Though we have no access to these performances, we can safely speculate that a different play was performed in each of these three locations.</p>
<p>Moreover, this play staged a legend that was popular across Europe. Before the end of the seventeenth century, in fact, the Fortunatus story had been translated into Dutch, Polish, Danish, Hungarian, Low German, English, French, Swedish, Icelandic, Italian, and perhaps Czech. This kind of popular culture served as ideal material for the traveling theater, but it also offers us a fascinating site for examining cultural translation in the period. How, we might ask, were plays adapted in different linguistic and cultural areas? And did the circulation of the legend – and even the English players – reshape the central story?</p>
<p>Even focusing simply on the most immediately relevant English and German editions provokes a great deal of uncertainty. Scholars generally divide the prose versions of <em>Fortunatus</em> into two families: The earliest printed version of the legend appeared in Augsburg in 1509, from which a number of printings followed; a second family derives from a Frankfurt edition, simplified, Protestantized, and moralized, from 1549 onwards. This second family group led to the translations throughout Europe, including the English translation (possibly) by Thomas Combe<a class="footnote-ref" href="#blamires1996"> [blamires1996] </a>. (More on this shortly.)</p>
<p>Fortunatus appeared first on the English stage in 1595-6, recorded by Henslowe as <em>The First Part of Fortunatus</em> . Dekker then received payment in 1599 for <em>The Whole History of Fortunatus</em> . And finally, a month later, a smaller additional payment for “the altrenge of the boocke of the wholl history of fortewnatus” and “for the eande of fortewnatus for the corte” . This last version, performed at court before Elizabeth, is Dekker’s printed version,The Pleasant Comedie of Old Fortunatus<a class="footnote-ref" href="#schlueter2013"> [schlueter2013] </a>.</p>
<p>Since the nineteenth century, the 1620 German <em>Fortunatus</em> has been considered a translation of Dekker’s play. For Charles Herford, it is a “barbarous piece,” and a “meager epitome of its original,” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#herford1886"> [herford1886] </a>but its connection to Dekker’s work is clear; Paul Harms agrees, though he demonstrates also that the author of the German piece drew extensively on the language of the German prose work<a class="footnote-ref" href="#harms1891"> [harms1891] </a>. June Schlueter has recently argued that this version may in fact be derived from an intermediary between the Dekker’s two Fortunati, and thus it serves as important evidence into the character of the first text before Dekker reworked it for court<a class="footnote-ref" href="#schlueter2013"> [schlueter2013] </a>. The play shares a number of elements with Dekker’s play (such as the use of echo in the opening scene, and the appearance of spirits to judge and admonish the characters) while also employing stock characteristics of the German stage (especially the stage clown, Pickelherring).</p>
<p>The relationship between the English prose translation and Dekker’s text has also been a subject of critical debate. In the nineteenth century, German scholars conclusively established that Dekker’s play relies on the Augsburg and Frankfurt versions of the Fortunatus story, but scholars have disagreed over whether these works were mediated through a translation. In his discussion of the many Fortunati in English translation, David Blamires assumes the priority of the prose, relying primarily on the fact that Fortunatus appears well-known in England from about 1577<a class="footnote-ref" href="#blamires1996"> [blamires1996] </a>, while Michael Haldane has more recently suggested that Dekker’s work influenced the prose version<a class="footnote-ref" href="#haldane2006"> [haldane2006] </a>. The earliest surviving English prose work we have, 1640, claims that it was translated by T.G.; all extant later editions emend this to T.C. According to the titlepage of the final printing, this work went through fourteen editions with relatively minor changes. Some have suggested that Dekker used a Dutch intermediary translation, but no Dutch translation before the seventeenth century is known.</p>
<p>My purpose here with both Dekker’s play and the prose work is not to take sides, but rather suggest quickly the complexity of the Fortunati-field. And this overview tracks simply a very few of the English and German editions, neglecting the multiple editions in other languages throughout Europe – and far from all English and German versions. (There is, for example, a manuscript of another copy at Kassel, perhaps composed at the court of Moritz, that seems influenced primarily by Hans Sach’s 1553 play.) We have a complex enough set of sources that discussing linear relationships seems almost impossible: there’s a circularity inherent in the 1620 text, relying both on Dekker and the German prose work, which itself had been a source for Dekker (perhaps with an English translation serving as intermediary). Instead of origin and adaptation, then, the theater presents a convoluted picture of mutually influencing sources and traditions, all tied together in a network, all sources available to the travelers as they adapted their text. As each performance varies, the borders of the work become more obscure; and if a digital edition can expand indefinitely to include related material, where should the line be drawn?</p>
<p>Even if we could recover the history of adaptation, however, these texts would not actually capture the kind of performance that made these players an international success. They used this complex tradition in spontaneous and contingent ways, catering their plays to their audiences<a class="footnote-ref" href="#limon1985"> [limon1985] </a>. Drawing on popular scenes, players felt free even to stitch scenes from various plays together if they had proven successful in the past<a class="footnote-ref" href="#haekel2004"> [haekel2004] </a>. Tiffany Stern has shown that many early modern playwrights saw themselves as “patchers,” and, if Gabriel Egan has qualified this for the London stage, it seems abundantly clear that the travelers worked with plays as piecemeal products; they apparently worried little about the integrity of thewhole<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stern2009"> [stern2009] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cordner2014"> [cordner2014] </a>. In the first decade, while players performed in English to German-speaking audiences, short, visual stories replete with shared iconography certainly helped mitigate the language barrier; but this necessity, reimagining plays as storehouses of performance episodes, shifting authority to the performer, who would respond to what worked on these foreign stages, fits poorly in a printed codex. Indeed, as Richard Preiss has demonstrated with clowning, to set in print the antics of Pickelherring reimagines them not as extemporaneous wit, but as an authored dialogue.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#preiss2014"> [preiss2014] </a></p>
<p>Much of the history of scholarship on this theater has been determined both by the challenges that the episodic character of this theater poses to source studies and the challenges that the extemporaneous style poses to aesthetic judgement. In the early twentieth century, these plays received rather desultory attention primarily for their connection to canonized playwrights. Almost always, early scholarship on the traveling theater was tied specifically to Shakespeare and fueled by the desire to trace these plays back to their prestigious originals and show how fully the players had corrupted Shakespeare’s art.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cohn1865"> [cohn1865] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#brennecke1964"> [brennecke1964] </a>. While, therefore, the archival scholarship was often excellent, and these sources remain valuable resources for the study of the travelers, they tend to privilege original English versions, denigrate the remaining playtexts associated with the theater, and oversimplify the relationship among the various plays because of a desire for simple and unidirectional connections. Indeed, it is the adaptable and episodic character of the theater, frustrating these attempts at tracking influence, that often elicited the most critical ire. For Albert Cohn, one of the earliest and most influential scholars of the travelers, this defined their failure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no inward connection among the parts; we see a succession of moving incidents, adventures of all sorts, intended to excite the interest of the spectators, to gratify their curiosity and their love of spectacle, or to tickle their risible muscles, but all these incidents are merely placed side by side without any internal unity.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cohn1865"> [cohn1865] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cohn concentrates specifically on the lack ofwholenessor coherence, framing his discussion of the <em>Engelische Comedien</em> by focusing on theirpatchedcharacter: he finds them in a “cruelly mutilated state” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cohn1865"> [cohn1865] </a>; their “corruption and mutilation are quite inexplicable,” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cohn1865"> [cohn1865] </a>he adds, if they had worked directly from the originals. Cohn’s image visualizes the original playtexts as complete texts – a whole codex – and the German adaptations as partial, incomplete – leaves ripped apart and regathered in an aesthetic abomination.</p>
<p>In the translation of <em>Fortunatus</em> , this piecemeal quality has similarly been disparaged. The story of Fortunatus, like the legend of Faustus and other popular folk stories that the travelers took on the road, was itself composite and episodic. One early scholar describes both the prose-version and the adapted plays as “an aggregate of very heterogeneous elements and a series of episodes, loosely appended and easily detached” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#herford1886"> [herford1886] </a>. For early critics, this typified the play’s aesthetic failures; for the players, it presented opportunities. The element drawing perhaps the strongest critique appears multiple times in the play: “Hier agiret Pickelhering” . Here Pickelhering performs. Those cryptic words end the first two acts and appear three times in the third act, and they advertise the extemporaneous and hybrid nature of this performance. According to Paul Harms, they almost certainly could not have been performed and resulted instead from a garbled memory of Dekker’sShadowcharacter. Once again reading the text as a unified whole, Harms proclaims: “Die englischen komödianten studierten die Wirkung, welche ihr Spiel auf das Publikum ausübte, sicherlich genau, und sie werden wohl kaum in dem Augenblick, wo die Spannung den höchsten Grad erreicht hatte, durch ein unorganisches Zwischenspiel sich um den Effekt gebracht haben” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#harms1891"> [harms1891] </a>. “The English Comedians studied the works which they performed to the public, surely enough, and they would hardly have broken the effect in the instant where the suspense had reached the highest level through an inorganic interlude.”</p>
<p>Despite Harms’ distaste for the extemporaneous elements, however, these brief scenes fit perfectly with what we know about the theater. We hear continually of the success of interludes, the popularity of the stage clown, and the use of visual icons and music.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> While failing in the text, then, these scenes apparently succeeded on stage, as Pickelhering remained one of the most popular and recognizable characters of the English travelers throughout the century. The problem, we might argue, comes from a breakdown in the remediation as the work moves from stage to page, encouraging us to search forwholeness.</p>
<p>The original author or compiler sought to stress the reciprocity between print and performance and, in his title, almost erases the translation that occurs in this move to printing the plays (for the first time): “der Gestalt in offenen Druck gegeben/ dass sie gar leicht darauss spielweiss widerumb angerichtet&hellip; können” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#meinus1620"> [meinus1620] </a>. “Given form in print that they might easily be reworked from there for performance.” Menius apparently desired the collection to be used as performance texts, and the works often reflect this connection to performance on stage. The stage directions are far more robust than in contemporary English editions, including even minor actions and emotions that they players expressed. Some speeches, moreover, seem as if Meinus attempts to capture exactly the performance he had witnessed. In one of the Pickelhering interludes, for example, we have a long and flowing sentence from a troubled old man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hum / hum / hum / alle meine Nachbarn / hum hum / hum / die thun mir sagen / hum / hum / hum / wie meine Fraw Maria / hum / hum / eine lose Hure seyn / hum / hum / hum / und bey den Schwager auch wol schlaffen sol / wol schlaffen sol / hum / hum / welches denn traun ein grosses were / ein grosses were / hum / hum / ich kan es nicht gläuben / noch nicht gläuben / hum hum / nein noch nicht gläuben kan ich das / denn die Fraw helt mich auch gar zu werth und lieb / ja grewlich lieb hat sie mich / O ein tugendtsam Weib / in 9. Herren Landen wird ihres gleichen nicht gefunden werden<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#meinus1620"> [meinus1620] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hum, hum, hum, all my neighbors, hum, hum, hum, they say to me, hum, hum, hum, how my wife Maria, hum, hum, is a loose whore, hum, hum, hum, and will also sleep with her brother-in-law, hum, hum, which then would be a big thing, in truth, a big thing, hum, hum, I can&rsquo;t believe it, still can&rsquo;t believe, hum hum, No, I still cannot believe that, for my wife holds me in such high regard and love, yes, an outrageous love she has for me. O a virtuous wife, in nine kingdoms her like isn&rsquo;t to be found!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sprawling, repetitive sentence presumably mimics the deliberative and anxious action of the old man, uncertain about his soon-to-be bride. Not only the diction – with the inclusion of guttural fussing ( “hum hum” ) – but even the punctuation highlights this performative aspect, with pauses (/) littered across the page, and even the odd double-colon (: / :).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> . Meinus, it seems, means to capture the dynamism of the plays in performance, but also struggled with the remediation, the impossibility of rendering performance entirely with punctuation.</p>
<p>In printing the plays, they were locked into a static form that belied the dynamic quality of the theater, and thus subject to a measure ofwholenessandunitythat seems entirely inappropriate to the kind of theater these players practiced. The messiness of the previous speech, with its odd punctuation, offers only one instance of this marked failure. More fully, we see the inability to capture the extemporaneous elements in the placeholders, theetc’s.in actors’ speeches and stage directions. As Laurie Maguire has shown,etc’swere much more open and ambiguous in the early modern theater, and could serve a range of purposes, from a bawdy pun to representing interruption. In this play, however, almost always theetc.’soffer the actors freedom in their performance<a class="footnote-ref" href="#maguire2018"> [maguire2018] </a>.Etc.appears eleven times, four times in a spoken line and seven times in stage directions, generally calling for either repetition (as when a disguised Fortunatus calls out apples to sell: “Beautiful apples of Damascus, etc. Beauty of youth, buy apples of Damascus, which will give you a beautiful countenance. Apples of Damascus, etc.” ) or for an embellished action on the stage: “ Now Andolosia comes. Sets Agrippina angrily on the ground. Goes around like a bear. Throws a rock. Turns his eyes in his head. She shivers and quakes, etc. ” Despite the very detailed account of Andolosia’s action, theetc.at the end of the line appears to grant both actors permission to extend this visual and emotion-wrought scene. Almost dumb-show-like in its visual interpretability, this kind of action seems particularly useful for this cross-cultural performance, especially before the works were translated, as this theater performed across languages.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most characteristic of this theater, we see the centrality and spontaneity of performance in both the detail and the occasional ambiguity in stage directions, especially, again, in the calls for Pickelhering to perform: “Hier agiret Pickelhering” . Pickelhering might act differently each time, playing on the audience, drawing extemporaneously on the materials of this particular stage or the beliefs of this particular community. As current research on this theater has stressed, Pickelhering was essential to the travelers’ popularity<a class="footnote-ref" href="#alexander2014"> [alexander2014] </a>; and yet, his kind of performance is erased in print. With the obvious absence of a performance archive, scholars encountered only the “shadow” of Pickelhering that remained.</p>
<p>The point, here, is that for this kind of transnational theater, based in adaptation and extemporaneous performance, a print edition misrepresents the players, and the inevitable flattening explains much of the critical dismissal of this theater. Both the research foci (which texts are related) and, perhaps more controversially, the aesthetic assumptions (in praise ofwholeness) of early scholarship on this theater was inevitably tied to the material technology of the works studied – the printed playtext. Our judgement of the theater is refracted through aesthetic appraisals of the printed remnants. The traveling players, however, could easily cut and replace, add and subtract, scenes and elements from their performances not because their theater was derivative and inferior, but because it took part in a tradition that did not privilege wholeness and sequential reading. To recreate these aspects of the theater, we need a kind of text similarly adaptable and episodic, that recovers the iconic elements and the visual elements of this theater without locking it into place; to recover Menius’s intention of plays that recreate these varied performances, we need to capture the piecemeal and extemporaneous style of the players.</p>
<p>The digital text, I would argue, allows us to do just that: to undercut the very notions of wholeness and plot linearity that have been insisted upon in the criticism of this theater. For several decades now, editors have been exploring the possibilities of e-space, challenging our continued reliance on the metaphors and assumptions of print, and they have developed a theory of digital publication that often aligns well with the practices of this theater in its modularity<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and spontaneity. For works in this theater, the mutability and multiplicity of the digital text, often stressed in scholarship, seems particularly germane, both in our attempt to re-imagine the digital text and to recover the aesthetics of the traveling theater. Over a decade ago, Jerome McGann noted that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A critical edition can clearly be built in digital form that allows a dynamical tracking and analysis of that recent literary discovery, thereaderly text.This clearly also means that the fundamentally dynamical character of the textual condition can be digitally realized: the dialectic of the field relations between the history of the text’s transmission and the history of its reception [&hellip;] In such a case you will not want to build a model of one made thing, you will try to design a system that can simulate all the realized and realizable documentary possibilities – the possibilities that are known and recorded as well as those that have yet to be (re)constructed.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcgann2006"> [mcgann2006] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extending this insight beyond the document to include performances, we might add that to recover the character of this early modern traveling theater, we should design an edition that highlights the spontaneity and modularity of the players’ style. To indemnify the lost records of this theater requires going beyond the traces that exist to look instead at how these dynamic plays might have been put together on stage.</p>

<p>A digital edition of this <em>Fortunatus</em> , then, might mitigate some of the challenges in understanding the success of the traveling players. As digital publication has become more prevalent, a large scholarly conversation has developed around experimenting with and theorizing the new medium. The work of digitizing texts has been so important and productive, in fact, that scholars continue to argue for its centrality to the digital humanities more generally<a class="footnote-ref" href="#earhart2012"> [earhart2012] </a>. While early enthusiasm for the digital over the print form has cooled, we now have over three decades of critical work that thinks through the difference between the codex and e-space and hypothesizes the future of the book in the digital age. The purported advantages of the digital, scholars have insisted, can be immense. Most simply, digital publication allows for the almost endless inclusion of material. For editors focused on drama, the multimedia capabilities of digital publication, along with this extra space, have seemed especially promising, as editions have experimented with including video of scenes or even entire versions of their chosen play<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jenstadandhirsch2016"> [jenstadandhirsch2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#hirsch2011"> [hirsch2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#caveloweandwoolland2014"> [caveloweandwoolland2014] </a>. Scholars have also focused on how the digital environment shifts audience participation. For digital scholarly editors, for example, Peter Shillingsberg’s sense of the text as work site has reshaped the kinds of things we want our editions to do<a class="footnote-ref" href="#shillingsburg2006"> [shillingsburg2006] </a>. Johanna Drucker’s catalogue of features offered by e-space has also been influential for editors, particularly her critique of mimicking the features of the codex and the call to instead take advantage of the ability for digital texts to be manipulated at the level of code; to be marked at each stage of manipulation; and to open collaborative spaces of exchange<a class="footnote-ref" href="#drucker2009"> [drucker2009] </a>.</p>
<p>Although debate continues over what exactly constitutes adigital scholarly edition,for many theorists and practitioners, taking advantage of these new capabilities is essential in distinguishing between print and digital media.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#robinson2013"> [robinson2013] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sahle2016"> [sahle2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#vanhoutte2010"> [vanhoutte2010] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#gabler2010"> [gabler2010] </a>. In Patrick Sahle’s definition, at least, it is not the mere fact of digitization, but rather an underlying “digital paradigm” which capitalizes on the new functionalities of computer publishing: “As long as the contents and functionalities of a typographically born and typographically envisioned edition do not really change with the conversion to digital data, we should not call these derivate editions digital . It is the conceptual framework that makes the thing – not the method of storage of the information either on paper or as bits and bytes”” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#sahle2016"> [sahle2016] </a>. This has been insisted frequently: that we cannot simply replicate the printed book online<a class="footnote-ref" href="#buzzoni2016"> [buzzoni2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#vanzundert2016"> [vanzundert2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#bryant2002"> [bryant2002] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#jenstadandhirsch2016"> [jenstadandhirsch2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#schloen2014"> [schloen2014] </a>. And yet, even decades into digital publishing, we still are discovering in practice and experimentation myriad ways in which this digital paradigm might take shape. As in digital publication generally, scholarly editors have explored how the use of hypertext, fluid publication, and the multimedia capabilities of these platforms have reshaped editing. Sahle, for example, has noted an overall shift from form to content<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sahle2016"> [sahle2016] </a>, while others have seen the de-centering of the editor and the democratization of editing<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crompton2014"> [crompton2014] </a>. In terms of the text itself, rather than the editorial role, many scholars have noted a move to a pluralistic notion of the text, what Elena Pierazzo calls the “dynamic, Heraclitean view of texts” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#pierrazo2016"> [pierrazo2016] </a>that results from digital publication. I would like to argue further through this case study of <em>Fortunatus</em> that these features will also, inevitably, shape the aesthetics of the early modern texts we move online; indeed, as we will see shortly, the very modularity that the digital environment encourages might help us recapture the style of the traveling theater.</p>
<p>Aesthetics has, of course, also been a central concern for scholars of digital media, though less often raised in discussions of scholarly editing, as theorists have cataloged the changing aesthetics of the new form: how do we experience the text differently – derive pleasure from the text differently – because of these new characteristics? Much of the early response to digital publication in the 1990s exuberantly theorized the radical change that hypertext would bring about, as well as the ephemerality of the new medium<a class="footnote-ref" href="#landow1992"> [landow1992] </a>. While these arguments have long been qualified, still, the facility of movement in a digital environment certainly changes the experience of reading. Commentators have long noted the continued de-centering of the author and intellectual property<a class="footnote-ref" href="#odonnell1998"> [odonnell1998] </a>, as well as the increasingly interactive and adaptive nature of the text online<a class="footnote-ref" href="#shillingsburg2006"> [shillingsburg2006] </a>. Similarly, the modularized structure of the hypertext, reflecting the web more generally, privileges a kind of episodic, context-laden writing and allows us to derive enjoyment from the text in new ways. As we have seen, the modular and collaborative ethos encouraged by the digital form strikingly reflects several neglected features of the early modern traveling theater.</p>
<p>As has often happened both in textual studies and humanities computing, the early modern theater, because of its eccentricities, fragmentary nature, and unpredictability, serves as an intriguing test site for practicing theory. Despite noting the tension between the past-facing textual scholarship and forward-facing interface design, Alan Galey encourages textual editors to continue their digital experimentation: “Why speculate when we can prototype? – that is, to regard the future of the book as something we create, not just observe and comment upon” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#galey2010"> [galey2010] </a>. A move away from the text, as we will see, might in fact be truer to the theater than a careful and exact rendering of the printed work online. Like many of these scholars, I am interested here in the aesthetics of form, but primarily as a way of solving the problems posed by editing the travelers’ <em>Fortunatus</em> . I will attempt to show that the nonlinearity and even randomness made possible in the digital platform not only recaptures an element of these early modern players’ performance erased by the codex, it also hints at the ways in which working from printed playtexts has shaped reaction to these early modern players and, indeed, distorted our focus on the traveling theater.</p>
<h2 id="coding-the-theatergram">Coding the Theatergram</h2>
<p>My question in this edition, then, is how might new technologies challenge the century-long interest inwholenessand instead help us address the impasses scholars have encountered when attempting to study this theater. The first problem, the problem of the episode, seems to me an issue that can profitably be addressed with richer metadata in editions of the traveling theater’s playtexts. As we have seen, source studies alone tend to oversimplify the complex matrix of influence and borrowing. In fact, focusing on the episodic character of the players&rsquo; text might help us re-conceive both the staging of early modern plays and the interrelations between national theaters. The episodic structure can be easily captured by the modularity inherent in the digital text – a simpler version, in fact, of the numerous TEI projects that code everything down to the smallest unit (as suggested by Peter Robinson in his work with Chaucer)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#robinson1996"> [robinson1996] </a>.</p>
<p>First, this markup would facilitate our attempt to track adaptation as the legend moves across the Continent, supplementing traditional approaches, and better fitting this messy history. As any critical edition requires, the digital <em>Fortunatus</em> will include a history of sources and adaptations, along with other closely-related versions of the play. Scholars involved in some of the most successful publication of early modern drama online have often stressed this expansiveness characteristic of the online edition, and it has allowed a number of innovative textual apparati<a class="footnote-ref" href="#massai2004"> [massai2004] </a>. And yet, from what we know of the character of this remarkably adaptive theater, this contextual material becomes practically endless. While the borders of Shakespeare online tend to be demarcated with some solidity – though perhaps unfairly – this lesser known and more collaborative theatrical production lacks both the cultural capital and the (somewhat) clear transmission history; thus an online version of the players&rsquo; <em>Fortunatus</em> , as we have seen, presents new challenges for a digital text that operates primarily by supplement.</p>
<p>More recent scholarship has turned from critique of the traveler&rsquo;s texts to examining the complex interconnections among sources in the early modern theater, and has shown, in the words of Robert Henke and Eric Nicholson, that “the transnational dissemination of European theater resembled an amorphous net or web much more than a line” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#henkeandnicholson2014"> [henkeandnicholson2014] </a>. This critical shift to modular thinking – invoking networks to explain social phenomenon – is certainly related to technological development, and we should perhaps be wary of our theory falling into yet another pattern (everything is a network); but undoubtedly digital publication also facilitates this approach. Moreover, this editorial stance reshapes our critical approach to the text. Re-conceiving the early modern theater text in this way, we are encouraged to search not for source and adaptation, but rather nodes and points of connection. And in the case of this theater, as I have suggested, our nodes should be not thewholeplay, but rather its building blocks: the episodes within.</p>
<p>Drawing on George Louise Clubb’s work on thetheatergram, a detachable and translatable story block used in drama, might help us conceptualize this network of connections<a class="footnote-ref" href="#clubb1989"> [clubb1989] </a>. By establishing the key story blocks and examining how they change in various editions – whether printed or recorded in the diaries of audience members &ndash; we might more accurately speculate on the relationship between plays, troupes, and even theaters. A larger attention to these overlappingtheatergramsin digital editions could thus prove useful for re-conceptualizing the works themselves, as well as for understanding the history of adaptation and transmission. In this edition, therefore, I have experimented with including metadata on eachtheatergramcontained in the text, treating each as a detachable unit. To accomplish this fully, we need a common language oftheatergrams. Early modern dramatic works are already divided into acts and scenes, obviously, but coding for thetheatergramencourages us instead to look for portable storyblocks that can function on their own – or be drawn into another work. Sometimes, however, these scenes might cross traditional hierarchical divisions (of scenes and acts) and therefore challenge TEI’s base in XML. TEI provides resources for embedding non-hierarchical structures, and perhaps the simplest and most applicable for the task of codingtheatergramsis the floatingText element, which allows us to encode front and back matter for each individualtheatergram. In fact, floatingText is often used for encoding plays-within-plays and dumb shows, and thetheatergramis certainly comparable in structure to a play-within.</p>
<p>The floatingText element allows us to associate a range of metadata with each of these smaller units, including characters, setting, and properties. Stage materials, for example, are important for the material history of the travelers, as we will see shortly. I have included them with a list in the set element, but remain open to any more elegant or efficient means. Less materially, we might also include information about the tropes and icons referenced in eachtheatergram. Because this theater was so visual, steeped in transnational icons, the metadata might profitably build on kinds of search techniques developed for images.</p>
<p>As an example oftheatergram, early in the German Fortunatus (as in Dekker’s play), when first confronted with the option of wealth or wisdom from Fortune, three spirits appear to share their fate and the lessons they learned of the futility of riches. This scene is incidental to the main plot, the three spirits never again appearing, but it does offer a generalizable lesson that, with the appropriate costuming, could be repeated again and again on stage. Moreover, though short, its inclusion in the play’s full title signals a kind of importance attached by the players to the episode. It might be coded with the floatingText element like this:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>While this is far shorter than mosttheatergrams, it conveys a sense of how we might define the characters, properties, and even images that constitute this packagable story block. The episode captures the adaptation of the theater, since it helps connect it to Dekker’s work (which included a similar scene) and distance it from the original prose editions (which did not). And, if three kings in royal regalia show up elsewhere to lament the cruelty of Fortune, we might speculate that these scenes are in some way connected. Data about visual icons and properties can help reimagine connections between plays, since these travelers, limited by what they could physically carry, must often have reused their materials of performance. Examples of overlapping properties are manifold for the traveling theater; we might wonder, for example, whether the horns given to Agrippina and the earls in <em>Fortunatus</em> were the same property used in the scene from <em>Faustus</em> (in the B text) in which Faustus gives a skeptical knight horns. Tracking the use of this object might link the two plays and provide insight into when the scene was added to Faustus.</p>
<p>Additional metadata at the level of the theatergram, moreover, would facilitate a better understanding of how context and resources shaped the episodic character of this theater. In the early twenty-first century, scholars revitalized the study of stage properties, as cultural materialists demonstrated the embeddedness of these products in economic, social, and religious systems of meaning . Indeed, in this scholarship, the circulation of props outside the theater becomes as important as their role on the stage. The travelers carried props and costuming across various regions of Northern Europe, and these materials themselves often marked the theater’s success and sanction. We have significant archival records – perhaps even better than our performance records – of the gifts of stage properties and costuming given by dukes to the travelers. Because these materials of performance were expensive, court books often recorded in detail what was purchased for the players. In 1612, for example, we know the Brandenburg players were given 70 ells of red silk; 50 ells of red cord; monks&rsquo; dresses; eighteen large and seventeen long plumes; a sword with a gold hilt; a wooden shield; four death heads; a painted cloud; and various carvings<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cohn1865"> [cohn1865] </a>. Most of these materials were associated with the <em>Turkish Triumph Comedy</em> , but inevitably, such expensive gifts would be reused and reshape later performance of other plays. Connecting plays to the materials necessary to stage them, therefore, once again helps us understand the relationship between the economic history and performance history of these players.</p>
<p>As with all editing, deciding what constitutes atheatergramand what material to include is an interpretive act. But it is based in the materials and conditions of the travelers’ performance, and it might help us begin visualizing the nodes and connections in this great web of early modern theater.</p>
<h2 id="an-aesthetics-of-randomness-and-the-episodic">An aesthetics of randomness and the episodic</h2>
<p>The problem of performance style is more complex and opens long-running debates over editing early modern drama for performance. While the online Fortunatus is not intended as a performance edition (but aimed at readers: students and scholars), increased attention to issues of performance in editing certainly facilitates a recovery of the strengths of the travelers and should shape any new edition of their plays<a class="footnote-ref" href="#worthen1997"> [worthen1997] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#jenkinsandsanders2014"> [jenkinsandsanders2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#hollandandorgel2006"> [hollandandorgel2006] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#caveloweandwoolland2014"> [caveloweandwoolland2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#thompsonandmcmullen2003"> [thompsonandmcmullen2003] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#erneandkidnie2004"> [erneandkidnie2004] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cordner2002"> [cordner2002] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#orgel2006"> [orgel2006] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#kidnie2000"> [kidnie2000] </a>. Scholars have also begun exploring the intersections between digital texts and performance<a class="footnote-ref" href="#galeyandniles2017"> [galeyandniles2017] </a>. My chief interest, however, is in capitalizing on the digital text to make the history and aesthetics of the traveling theater more apparent. The traveling theater, I would argue, represents a special case in which not only do we have few existing playtexts, long considered derivative of other plays, and almost no record of performance history, but the playtexts themselves point to the importance of spontaneous, contingent (context-based) performance. We might also add that the tension between authority and collaborative performance does not exist for the traveling theater’s texts; they are attached to no author, but rather evidence of how the English plays were adapted during performance in European contexts.</p>
<p>Coding the theatergram already shifts our focus from the whole to the episode, inevitably influencing our critical insights. Beyond this, however, new capabilities of the digital medium might usefully illuminate the traveling theater’s performance, in part because the modular style (plays built from small, interchangeable storyblocks) and spontaneity (plays changed based on context in impromptu performance) are especially congenial to the digital text. We might, for example, note simply the expansion of space and the multimodality common to the digital edition. Perhaps videos of Pickelhering characters, or at least the clowning tradition that stems from these characters, are available on Youtube. Certainly, experimentation with multimodality in performance editions has proven successful<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jenstadandhirsch2016"> [jenstadandhirsch2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#roberts-smith2013"> [roberts-smith2013] </a>. As the editors of the experimental and influential <em>Richard Brome Online</em> have argued, “where there is no substantial stage history of a playwright’s canon, then editing to illuminate the <em>theatrical</em> strengths of the texts becomes more urgent” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#caveloweandwoolland2014"> [caveloweandwoolland2014] </a>, and videos of actors performing these roles, like the <em>Brome Online</em> edition provides, could help readers understand the success of these plays. Yet such videos, while very useful for imagining the multiplicity of performance, would be only a static way of filling in the placeholder provided by the stage direction, and once again would not necessarily replicate the adaptation and dynamism of the actual performances. I have therefore also experimented with a simple Javascript program, which randomly presents one of the Pickelhering interludes included in the collection in the space of the stage direction calling for Pickelhering to act. Seven of these interludes were contained within the collection, ranging from short plays to long songs, and each capitalizes on the non-linguistic strengths of this theater: slap-stick comedy, music, acrobatics. This, certainly, would still never perfectly replicate the player’s performance, which remains its own distinct form; players often navigated their contexts and appealed directly to their audiences in sophisticated ways, habits of performance that a randomly generated text would belie. This form does, however, ensure that different readers would experience a slightly different play; the overlapping themes between <em>Fortunatus</em> and the recorded Pickelhering plays, from gender competition to class resentment, might highlight different elements of the central, Fortunatus plot. More simply, and yet I think more importantly, the text changes with each reading, and the possibilities in the digital space for animation allow us to recreate at least the experience of reading a work with changing parts. In this, perhaps, even the aesthetic value of wholeness might be challenged.<br>
<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><br>
The program is quite simple, modeled after the number of random generators operating online. It uses a Request command to pull the text from a file in a folder of Pickelhering Plays, and Math.random() to ensure that each time the play loads a new, random Pickelhering interlude is selected. Currently, readers must click on the stage direction to display the text of the interlude, though it would, of course, be simple to immediately include the text.</p>

O, might I have been born of royal blood, I&#39;d serve the king so truly that he would have to give her to me; but I am far too common.

Near him sat his exuberantly beautiful daughter, Agrippina, over whom I am now even more fervent than before, and more fervently in love, so that I almost couldn&#39;t eat or drink anymore. O woe to me that I came here, for here I received a fire in my heart that cannot be put out, for Agrippina, you consider me too lowly, because I was born in a poor, not a royal, family. O, there is nothing more difficult on earth than to love without enjoying. I, too, can now complain, that I am just a little slave of love. Yet what doesn&#39;t love do?

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As this short example shows, this randomness both employs and also frustrates some of our central methods for reading plays, for making sense of plot and subplot. Trained to value wholeness, we inevitably attempt to integrate and synthesize, to show how the juxtaposition of the interlude might comment on the main plot. At the same time, the randomness that is a feature of this text insists that, however true those congruities might be, they are coincidental rather than intentional; the subplot has no necessary role, and will, in fact, likely be changed if you refresh your browser. We might even imagine a productive course discussion in which students have read different interludes. At the very least, this kind of program offers a textual representation of the fact that, when dealing with plays, the same work doesn’t always contain even the samelinguistic code(to borrow McGann’s language).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If, as I have tried to show, the form of the codex has shaped our response to the early modern traveling theater, the question becomes how will new forms of digital publication reshape this response: how will the aesthetics of the digital reveal – and perhaps also distort – the travelers’ plays that have come down to us from early modernity? While my use of TEI offers nothing new, the focus ontheatergramsshifts our critical focus and forces us to interact with the text in a new way; we might, I suggest, discover quite a bit that was missed when constrained too tightly by our desire forwholeness.</p>
<p>Early criticism of this theater was very much a book-based criticism. Understandably, as these were the only remnants they had from which to work, the nineteenth century pioneers tied research and response to the travelers to text rather than performance, influencing the kind of aesthetic judgements they made. My claim throughout, however, has been that as we migrate these texts into a new medium, we have the opportunity to recover characteristics of the original performance – spontaneity, randomness, episode – not only to help us better understand and experience the theater’s success, but also to solve some of the critical problems posed by the traveling theater.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a long way from conservative textual scholarship, and one might argue that, in creating this episodic text, not only am I failing to capture the actual character of performance, but I am equally failing to capture the codex in which these works first appeared; that instead, I have Frankensteined into existence a new work. And this is certainly true: we have no way of knowing if these included interludes were the ones performed with <em>Fortunatus</em> , nor how varioustheatergramschanged in performance. The digital environment provides options for the reader/user, however, and I hope this criticism is blunted by the fact that a reader might simply read through a careful diplomatic transcription of the 1620 text, ignoring the interludes. In the randomness of the episode, I am interested more in the form than content – and in what the experience of reading might tell us about the interaction of form and content. I am interested in trying to understand what made this episodic, spontaneous performance so successful, to get away from the textsmutilatedinto the codex. One might even make the argument, as many have, that the move from print to digital is one from wholeness – a finished, closed product most often read linearly – to modularity – an open process, connected with hyperlinks, blurring lines between text and context. But perhaps in this move, we more closely approach the ethos and aesthetics of the early modern travelers.</p>

<p>For at least two decades, scholars have written on the degree to which we live in analgorithmic culture, acomputational theocracy, or been beholden to the power of computer algorithms [<a href="#granieri2014">Granieri 2014</a>] [<a href="#bogost2015">Bogost 2015</a>] [<a href="#introna2000">Introna and Nissenbaum 2000</a>]. In recent years, scholars have published book-length critiques of the sexism and racism behind increasingly omnipresent and opaque search systems and mobile apps [<a href="#eubanks2018">Eubanks 2018</a>] [<a href="#noble2018">Noble 2018</a>] [<a href="#oneil2016">O’Neil 2016</a>] [<a href="#wachter-boettcher2017">Wachter-Boettcher 2017</a>]. I build on these scholars’ groundbreaking works on the hazards of algorithmic bias by analyzing one academic database’s topical indexing functions. Beyond a critique of inaccuracies and omissions, I detail how such subject miscategorizations reinforce sexist and racist belief systems, thus having a disproportionate effect on marginalized groups and research.</p>
<p>In April 2018, I attempted to use the topic indexing system in the academic database, JSTOR, to prepare a state of the field presentation on early American women’s history. I quickly realized that in several areas of my expertise (colonial North America, women’s, race, Indigenous and African American histories), JSTOR’s topic categorizations displayed concerning shortcomings. Articles that were focused entirely on women’s history did not seem to be categorized by the topic ofwomen. Instead, some were mischaracterized withmenas the most relevant topic. JSTOR’s topics for African, African American, Native American and race histories showed misapplications and erasures as well, fundamentally distorting the content of scholarship in these fields.</p>
<p>Most scholars are at least passingly familiar with the Library of Congress Classification System and the controlled vocabulary (a set list of terms used for indexing and information retrieval) of the Library of Congress Subject Headings [<a href="#loc2019a">Library of Congress Classification</a>] [<a href="#loc2019b">Library of Congress Subject and Genre/Form Headings</a>]. These systems have structured knowledge for well over a century. Such categorization schemas have always been less than objective, as the 2016 struggle between the Library of Congress and House of Representatives over the subject headingIllegal aliensmade abundantly clear [<a href="#peet2016">Peet 2016</a>]. Scholars have pointed to anti-LGBT bias, Eurocentric and anti-Afrocentric biases, outdated terminology, and the limitations of discipline-based, hierarchical structure within the Library of Congress classification systems for many decades [<a href="#bethel1994">Bethel 1994</a>] [<a href="#christensen2008">Christensen 2008</a>] [<a href="#diao2016">Diao and Cao 2016</a>] [<a href="#drabinski2009">Drabinski 2009</a>] [<a href="#howard2018">Howard and Knowlton 2018</a>]. Thus, concern over bias in indexing and classification schemas is not a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, the rise of digital databases and accompanying machine learning technologies has brought new concerns. Critical algorithm studies have developed in response to the influence of unknowable algorithms on consequential decisions and actions. At their most basic, algorithms are a list of programmed instructions, and can be millions of lines of proprietary coding, never seen or understood by end users. Scholars have called attention to the difficulty in “deconstructing the black boxes of Big Data” that create our algorithmic culture<a class="footnote-ref" href="#pasquale2015"> [pasquale2015] </a>. Proprietary algorithms that produce racist results, in particular, have been a repeated concern among data scientists and social justice advocates. [<a href="#buolamwini2016">Buolamwini 2016</a>] [<a href="#paul2016">Paul 2016</a>] [<a href="#schwartzapfel2019">Schwartzapfel 2019</a>] [<a href="#ulloa2019">Ulloa 2019</a>]. One of the most influential media and library information scholars, Safiya Noble, has convincingly argued that we must interrogate the “implications of the artificial intelligentsia for people who are already systematically marginalized and oppressed” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#noble2018"> [noble2018] </a>. Noble’s work documenting and challenging the racism reproduced by search engines (primarily Google) has been particularly impactful both within and outside academic discourse.</p>
<p>Digital Humanities scholars have argued that seemingly objective search functions are anything but, and have offered varied approaches to analyzing the systems we so readily adopt. Many have argued for more broad definitions of algorithms to account for the entire socio-cultural process that produces them [<a href="#kitchin2017">Kitchin 2017</a>]. Accordingly, JamieSkyeBianco warns that “tools don’t reflect upon their own making, use or circulation or upon the constraints under which their constitution becomes legible” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bianco2012"> [bianco2012] </a>. Feminist and anti-racism scholars have convincingly shown how algorithmic shortcomings in search, database construction, and knowledge organization can be particularly detrimental to non-mainstream fields. Tara McPherson directly ties the marginalization of race-related studies to “the very designs of our technological systems” and “post-World War II computational culture” that continues to “partition off consideration of race in our work in the digital humanities” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcpherson2012"> [mcpherson2012] </a>. Moya Z. Bailey more broadly asks about the effect on diverse scholars: “How do those outside the categories white and male navigate this burgeoning disciplinary terrain?” , and Roopika Risam questions the degree to which digital humanities processes as a whole (re)produce centers and peripheries<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2011"> [bailey2011] </a>[<a class="footnote-ref" href="#risam2015"> [risam2015] </a>. Such intersectional approaches recognize the structural, ideological and political forces that contribute to the creation and promulgation of digital library technologies.</p>
<p>Scholars have questioned the role of the database, specifically, as its own configured media object and unit of inquiry, rather than just a neutral tool [<a href="#manovich1999">Manovich 1999</a>] [<a href="#vesna2007">Vesna 2007</a>]. Librarians, especially those with technology expertise or digital interests, have likewise begun investigating bias in academic discovery systems and scholarly databases. With the creation of massive digital corpuses of scholarship and archives, providers have looked for ways to provide enriching metadata. (Often described as data about data, metadata in this context is added information about a document or item, often used for discovery.) Unfortunately, classifying contents is rife for the introduction of biases. Jeffrey Daniels noted in 2015 that an Ex Libris discovery tool returned sexist results: a search on stress in the workplace returned only a Wikipedia article on “Women in the workforce” , implying that women and stress were the same thing<a class="footnote-ref" href="#reidsma2019"> [reidsma2019] </a>. Matthew Reidsma’s recent book, <em>Masked By Trust: Bias in Library Discovery</em> , points to the additional demands on library discovery systems to support a variety of intellectual inquiries that may be particularly complex, including “big, challenging, often contentious topics” without objectively correct answers, in contrast to mundane generic searches, such as “nearest gas station” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#reidsma2019"> [reidsma2019] </a>. Riedsma’s earlier work on Proquest, an academic digital document provider, found that problematic search results related to likely already-marginalized or politicized topics, including “women, the LGBT community, race, Islam, and mental illness” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#reidsma2016"> [reidsma2016] </a>.</p>
<p>As one of a relatively small subset of women’s historians with long-term engagement in both machine learning and feminist scholarship, I may be relatively well placed to undertake a critique of JSTOR’s possible algorithmic bias [<a href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013, 123-124</a>] [<a href="#block2011">Block and Newman 2011</a>] [<a href="#newman2006">Newman and Block 2006</a>]. Still, I write from the perspective of an academic teacher and researcher with substantial knowledge in digital humanities, but without training in taxonomy or library and information science. Accordingly, rather than a comprehensive analysis of JSTOR’s search and topic-based systems, I offer a targeted and detailed review of the topics applied to scholarship in my area of expertise so that I can base all quantitative and text-based analyses on my in-depth understanding of each work’s content, arguments, and foci. This exploration into JSTOR’s topical indexing system for women’s and race histories points to the problematic ways that technology can misconstrue and marginalize scholarship and suggests areas for needed improvement.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-algorithms">Finding the Algorithm(s)</h2>
<p>JSTOR began as an onlineJournal Storagedatabase, and is today a broader not-for-profit digital library built for academic research. JSTOR touts its availability in 10,215 institutions and 176 countries where it provides access to more than twelve million pieces of academic writing in seventy-five disciplines. It is an indispensable resource to the academic community in U.S. and women’s history.</p>
<p>Various online guides to JSTOR describe their topic labeling algorithms in general terms. The JSTOR Thesaurus, apparently launched sometime between 2013 and 2017, provides the controlled vocabulary (standardized terminology) that makes up topics<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jstor2017"> [jstor2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#jstor2019b"> [jstor2019b] </a>. In 2018, Jabin White, a vice president at ITHAKA, the digital technology not-for-profit that produces JSTOR, described JSTOR’s the creation of the Thesaurus as a way to address the need for descriptive and semantic metadata that now provides “additional value” for libraries and users [<a href="#white2018">White 2018</a>]. The Thesaurus is constructed of seventeen public and corporate-produced vocabularies, and is not available to users online. [<a href="#jstor2019b">JSTOR 2019b</a>]. JSTOR reports that it relied on the software company,<a href="http://www.accessinn.com/">Access Innovations</a>, to create the Thesaurus. Access Innovations touts its four decades of taxonomy development experience which allows it to create classifications for customers to “fit both your content and the way your users interact with that content” by working “closely with your subject matter experts” .</p>
<p>It is not transparent precisely how JSTOR Thesaurus terms become topics for specific pieces of scholarship. A JSTOR support page explains some details of topic indexing its database: “If a term is present at least three times, it is recognized by the thesaurus and triggers the application of a topic” with “up to 10 topics assigned to” an article or chapter<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jstor2019a"> [jstor2019a] </a>. It is difficult to tell from available descriptions what precise system(s) JSTOR is using to create its listed topics. A JSTOR taxonmer explained that it relies on “both auto &amp; manual rule creation” , and specified that they use Wikipedia or DBPedia (which includes over five million entities of structured content from Wikipedia) to provide information for and descriptions of topics.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> These topics do not seem to be produced by probabilistic topic modeling, even though JSTOR Labs’ Text Analyzer uses LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), a popular topic model<a class="footnote-ref" href="#snyder2012"> [snyder2012] </a>. Such statistically based models are part of the larger field of probabilistic modeling and automatically learn a set of topics that comprehensively describe a set of documents. In the past decade-plus, topic modeling has been increasingly applied to humanities research questions and texts to find themes in such large corpora withouta priorisubject categories [<a href="#block2006">Block 2006</a>] [<a href="#meeks2012">Meeks and Weingart 2012</a>]. Topic modeling is particularly good at disambiguation (separating different senses of words) and thematically linking words with allied meanings (e.g.: car, automobile, BMW and Ford would all likely be listed in the same topic). Even though information pages on JSTOR’s Thesaurus explicitly “recognize” the need to distinguish among homonyms, in practice, the topic identification system seems to fall short on effective word disambiguation. For example, it lists the topic ofCharityfirst for an article by Jessica Millward about a woman namedCharity Folks[<a href="#millward2013">Millward 2013</a>].</p>
<p>The end user can only guess at the precise topic-defining and ranking process. For instance, does JSTOR’s topic identification system rely on Part-of-Speech Tagging (identifying whether each word is a noun, verb, etc) to ascertain each word’s or phrase’s role in a given sentence? Or might it rely on Shallow Parsing tochunkparts of sentences (nouns, verbs, etc) with less specificity? Do JSTOR’s topic assignment algorithms identify specific text phrases such as Named Entities (proper nouns, such as individual and organization names) and select other multi-word expressions?</p>
<p>I have attempted to describe JSTOR’s topic algorithms not because it is every user’s responsibility to understand controlled vocabularies, rule bases, machine indexing, knowledge bases, and the principles and practices of taxonomy construction. But such human and coding details – where topic information comes from, whether indexing is human or machine curated – can create bias in the results. For example, Jessica Parr, a historian with an MS in Archives management, was “surprised” at JSTOR’s use of Wikipedia/DBPedia: “People have been talking about Wikipedia&rsquo;s considerable flaws with race and gender topics for several years. And these are flaws that haven&rsquo;t been fixed. Using a tool like DBPedia means your system is full of these racial and gendered biases” [<a href="#lapowsky2015">Lapowsky 2015</a>] [<a href="#zevallos2014">Zevallos 2014</a>].</p>
<p>Even without becoming expert coders and taxonomers, scholars who use databases can and should ask questions about the ethics of our research tools. We can learn to probe the ethics of databases in the same ways that scholars have spent the past decade productively interrogating the construction of archives [<a href="#falzetti2015">Falzetti 2015</a>] [<a href="#fuentes2016">Fuentes 2016</a>] [<a href="#stoler2010">Stoler 2010</a>]. Whose stories may be silenced or misrepresented in various classification systems? How can users begin to understand the impact of knowledge systems on our understanding of the scholarship done in particular subject areas? Analyzing the choices of programmers, taxonomers, and other database system contributors makes clear that academic discvery databases are the result of human decisions rather than any imagined algorithmic neutrality. By focusing on the consequences of JSTOR’s algorithmic indexing choices for scholarship in women’s African American, Native American, and race histories, this essay offers a first step to rethinking the topical indexing of an influential scholarly database.</p>
<h2 id="jstors-topical-indexing-erasure-and-misinterpretation">JSTOR’s Topical Indexing: Erasure and Misinterpretation</h2>
<p>Jennifer Morgan’s article, “ Some Could Suckle over Their Shoulder : Male Travelers, Female Bodies, and the Gendering of Racial Ideology, 1500-1770” , is one of the<a href="https://blog.oieahc.wm.edu/getting-lost/">most downloaded</a>in the <em>William and Mary Quarterly</em> [<a href="#morgan1997">Morgan 1997</a>]. Personally, I have taught it well over a dozen times since its first publication. Morgan’s article focuses on European travelers’ constructions of African and Native American women’s bodies, showing how European print descriptions and images of women’s appearance and behavior helped to build the foundations of race-based slavery.</p>

</figure>
<p>JSTOR lists nine relevant topics for Morgan’s article (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The first, and presumably most relevant, isMen.Womendoes not even appear, althoughMothersdoes. JSTOR topics further categorize this scholarship as being aboutBlack peopleandAfrican Americans. Both the present and absent topics for Morgan’s article suggest intersectionally biased impacts for historians of slavery, race, African and African American history, and women’s history. (On intersectionality, the idea that interlocking systems of power, such as sexism and racism, work together to multiply marginality, see the foundational work of<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crenshaw1989"> [crenshaw1989] </a>). To begin with, the absence ofwomenand primacy ofmenis curious, given that JSTOR states that a topic’s “relevance is determined by how frequently the term appears in the piece of content” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#jstor2019a"> [jstor2019a] </a>.</p>
<p>Given these claims, I undertook an approximate word frequency count of Morgan’s article, wondering if it were possible that the text mentionsmenfar more thanwomen.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> As Table I shows, the occurrence of words such as women/woman/female far outnumber men/man/male.Womenalone occurs more than seven times as often asmen. So it is concerning that JSTOR determined thatmenis more relevant a topic thanwomen. Moreover, even the categoryBlack peoplemisrepresents the article’s focus. A bigram count (occurrences of meaningful two-word compounds) shows thatAfrican womenis the most frequent two-word expression in the article, appearing 32 times, andblack womenis the third most frequent. Calculating bigram frequencies like these offers a methodologically productive way to add specification that better translates broad terms into a topic. Such bigrams show how Morgan’s article focuses on women, not generic people of African descent. But this intersectional identity is erased by JSTOR’s topics. Other researchers have found that Ex libris tools also tended to turn searches related to Africa “into topics about African-Americans” . This may relate to their shared use of Wikipedia for subject information and metadata<a class="footnote-ref" href="#reidsma2019"> [reidsma2019] </a>. Replication of popular views on race rather than discipline-specific or theoretically informed ones may lead to these kinds of biased results.<br>

The issue with JSTOR’s topical representation of Morgan’s article is not just the absence of women, it is the minimization of an array of terms related to feminist analysis. Versions of the wordmother, which is sixth on JSTOR’s topic list, appears about 22 times in this article. Yet lexemes ofgenderappear more than 30 times, andsexrelated terms (sexuality, sexual, sexualized) appears more than 50 times, but neither appear as relevant topics. Sexuality and gender are key analytic categories to scholars who do women’s history, making their absence is a notable failing of JSTOR’s topic categorization system.</p>
<p>The topics related to the analytic interrogation of racial ideologies and representation of non-white historical actors show additional problems. One of the most relevant analytic terms for historians,race, does not feature as a topic, even though the article is about the construction of early modern racial ideologies – as the title clearly conveys. Indeed, the wordraceappears more than twenty times and other forms of the word (racial, racism, racialized) occur almost as often.</p>
<p>Even more concerning is the use ofAfrican Americansas a topic. This is an article primarily about descriptions of African women by Europeans traveling through Africa and Indigenous women in what would become America. In fact,Africaappears almost 3 dozen times, andAfricanover seventy times, but neither made JSTOR’s topic list. In contrast,African-Americanappears once — in footnote 36 as part of the title of a cited book. Yet JSTOR lists it listed as the third most relevant topic of this article. An entire continent of people has been erased through topical mislabeling in an echo of the Euro-centric bias long critiqued in other library information systems<a class="footnote-ref" href="#howard2018"> [howard2018] </a>. The algorithmic erasure of African and African American women has been repeatedly noted as problemamtic by scholars across fields [<a href="#noble2018">Noble 2018</a>] [<a href="#johnson2018">Johnson 2018</a>].</p>
<p>Likewise, terms frequently related to Native Americans (Native, Indian, Amerindian, Indigenous) occur more than three dozen times in the text, yet did not rate a topic, whilecivility, which appeared just over a dozen times, did. Such topic choices raise the question of whose perspective JSTOR privileges with its topics. Morgan certainly discussescivility, but does so in terms of the ways that Europeans mobilized it as a weapon of racemaking. Notions of civility are not a helpful representation of the article’s contents because ideas connected to racial ideologies apparently did not merit a JSTOR topic. Markers of civilization have historically marked non-Europeans as exploitable heathens, but the modern meaning of civility as formal politeness elides these racist and colonialist overtones. The erasure of racial ideologies, as well as topics of Africans and Indigenous Americans, means that the necessary topical context here is lost, fundamentally misrepresenting civility’s meaning in Morgan’s work.</p>
<p>These comparative word frequencies suggest some human-created problems with JSTOR’s topics construction. Contrary to what seems to be JSTOR’s explanations of its algorithmic processes, these topics are not based simply on word frequency. It appears that JSTOR or outsourced staff have made decisions about what should and should not be in its Thesaurus and the granularity into which some topics should be divided. Unfortunately, those decisions seem to have effects that are both unintended and unattended to. JSTOR’s rule base system (which may involve human-curated sets of rules and/or rule based machine learning systems that decide the parameters for classification based on applied domain knowledge) appears to be one that minimizes women, Africans, and scholarship on race as relevant topics. Analytic categorizations that seem most appropriate for scholarship on gender, race, and sexuality, as well as intersectional topics, seem largely absent. This appears to be suggest an indexing bias, offering an example “where inaccuracy crosses the line into bias” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#reidsma2016"> [reidsma2016] </a>.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-the-women-in-womens-history">Where are the Women in Women’s History?</h2>
<p>Other women’s history articles show similar erasures and misrepresentations. In September 2017, historian Monica Mercado tweeted about the JSTOR topics applied to Linda Kerber’s well known article, “Separate Spheres, Female Worlds, Woman’s Place: The Rhetoric of Women’s History” [<a href="#kerber1988">Kerber 1988</a>]. Especially since the wordswomen,woman, andfemaleall appear in the title, Mercado found it surprising that JSTOR’s most relevant topic wasMen. A JSTOR’s taxonomy manager’s response was, effectively, that it was just the algorithm: the result was “relate[d] to how many times those topics appear in the document” . She offered as proof that “ Men appears 63x; Women 25” (<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). The user cannot know exactly what algorithm created those topic frequencies from this brief interaction: did men appear twice as often as women astopicsor as word frequencies? And “related to” suggests another mediating factors such as human curation or a pre-existing Thesaurus of terms. Regardless, word frequency should have some direct relationship to topic development. Certainly anyone who knows Kerber’s work would wonder at JSTOR’s topical claim: does one of the founders of U.S. Women’s history really focus on men more than twice as often as women in her scholarship?</p>

<p>While I cannot recreate JSTOR’s topic-producing algorithms, I can count the approximate frequency of male/female-associated words in Kerber’s article as a supplement to my own understanding of its women-focused content. Table 2 shows thatwomenappears more than five times as often asmen. In fact,womenis by far the most frequent word in the article (after stopword removal) with more than 360 mentions. In contrast,menappears fewer than 60 times. And an array of women-related words (feminine, feminism, feminist) appear far more than three dozen times. There are zero appearances of any masculine parallel terms (<a href="#table02">Table 2</a>). As anyone who has read Kerber’s work would attest, it is nonsensical that the first topic for this article isMen.<br>

Sometime between September 2017 and April 2018 JSTOR attempted to address Mercado’s concern over the minimization of women’s history. Unfortunately, it appeared to do so by removingWomenas a topic for this article (See<a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>). It did addWomen’s historyas the fifth topic – but given that this article is entirely about the state of women’s history, that seems a rather substantial underrating of its importance, particularly sinceMenremained the first topic.</p>

<p>When again asked about the absence of the topic ofWomen, a JSTOR taxonomist responded on social media that “We removed Women as a topic due to noise a few years ago” . (Perhaps she was confused about dates, since Mercado posted that image in September 2017.) The JSTOR staff member was referring to the computer science meaning ofnoiseas data that is meaningless or unable to be correctly interpreted. But what does it signal that JSTOR decided thatWomenisnoise, butMenis not? This seeming lack of understanding of the historical place of women and women-related topics in academic scholarship suggests that structural power relations – a central analytic accomplishment of the field — are not on JSTOR’s radar. One might argue that sinceMenis the standard (or what some call thenull gender), it might be a less frequent search thanWomen, who still tend to carry non-normative status<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wagner2015"> [wagner2015] </a>. When men are the subject in the vast majority of historical scholarship, how is it useful for the topic ofMento appear as such a relevant topic? And why wouldMennot appear as a major topic for the majority of historical scholarship, then? The same tweet claimed that JSTOR will “probably do the same with Men” (remove it as a too-noisy topic), but as of July 2019, that did not seem to have happened and it remains first in the list of relevant topics for Kerber’s article. Men still remains an outsize and inaccurate JSTOR topic in many women’s history pieces of scholarship. Regarding women asnoiseeffectively erases the hard-won successes of women’s history, including the decades of efforts to write women back into historical analysis.</p>
<p>The Kerber article’s other assigned topics also minimize the importance of women in the piece. Why would a topic likeUS historybe seen as more relevant to this article thanWomen’s history? Surely U.S. history is an exceptionally broad, perhaps even a too noisy topical category? Moreover, as any women’s historian can attest,genderandwomenare distinct topics of inquiry – this is an article about women far more than gender (a quick frequency comparison:genderappears about 2 dozen times,womenmore than 350). YetGender equalityandGender rolesboth appear as topics. At best,Gender equalityoffers a positivist gloss on Kerber’s piece, which is about understanding women’s lives through the historic construct of separate spheres; not about women achieving gender equality.Gender rolesis a description of culturally expected behavior.Genderas an analytic category is how scholars have theorized the ways that structural sexism allows patriarchy to flourish; in other words, an apparatus to understand gender inequality and oppression. Gender as a category of historical analysis is one of the major inventions of feminist scholarship<a class="footnote-ref" href="#scott1986"> [scott1986] </a>. It denotes far more than women’s roles in a given society. Instead, it is a sophisticated problematization of heteroesssential and patriarchal structures of power. Feminist scholars have theorized gender in terms of its performativity, its relation to matrices of domination, and its intersectionality [<a href="#butler2006">Butler 2006</a>] [<a href="#collins2008">Collins 2008</a>]. Turning gender intoGender rolestransforms an analytic concept of power relations into a descriptive term that identifies how men and women are expected to behave in a given society.</p>
<p>Other topics show additional inadvertent erasures, suggesting granularity or algorithmic decisions that have substantial consequences for categorization accuracy. The topic ofhousesis puzzling because Kerber’s article does not generally focus onhousesin the sense of an architectural entity, nor as a woman’s workplace. A frequency count of Kerber’s article shows thathouse/housesappears more than two dozen times — but almost all of those mentions are in reference toHull House, the Chicago settlement house co-founded by Nobel peace prize winner Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr. A bigram frequency list confirms thatHull Houseis the fourth most frequent pair of terms. In this case, an algorithmic error has erased the work of a Nobel-prize winning woman rather than offering metadata to promote relevant discovery.</p>
<p>Kerber’s piece is not an exception. In my review of women’s history articles, these kinds of problems appeared repeatedly. For example, Terri Snyder’s 2012 “Refiguring Women in Early American History” is, as its title suggests, a review of the field of early American women’s history [<a href="#snyder2012">Snyder 2012</a>]. When I first looked at this article’s topics in April 2018, women was its ninth most relevant topic, after the top three ofNative Americans,History, andAfrican American Literature(<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). This again raises questions of whyWomenwould be seen as noise, butHistorywould not – not to mention that it is not accurate to say that Snyder’s article focuses on African American literature.</p>
<p>The social media attention to JSTOR’s shortcomings in April 2018 seems to have led to ad hoc changes. The JSTOR taxonomy manager tweeted thatwomenwould be “added back as a use case” within the month. (In computational terms, a use case defines the relationship between actors and defined steps; from the user’s perspective, it is how a system will respond to their request. I’m not sure exactly what ause casemeans in this context, sinceWomenclearly was a possible JSTOR topic already – just not deemed a highly relevant one.) And indeed,Womenhad moved up to the first, and presumably most relevant topic position by July 2018, andWomen’s historywas now a topic as well, which is a much more appropriate topic than the April topic ofWorking women(<a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>). Yet we might wonder what domain experts were involved with this decision-making process. It is also worth noting that this shift led to other negative outcomes: all mentions of marginalized groups (African American literature, Native Americans) were removed as topics. In adding a focus on women and gender, JSTOR’s topics eliminated all sense of the article’s intersectional approach to and focus on non-white women in early American history.</p>

<p>While this does suggest that JSTOR investigated and revamped its topic identification in response to critiques, the continued inclusion ofMenstill seems concerning. Moreover,SwordsandAuctionsdo not seem to be particularly relevant topics to the main arguments of this piece, especially alongside an exceptionally broad topic likeUnited States history. JSTOR’s application ofSwordas a topic is a recognizable curiosity – and at some point between July 2018 and July 2019, JSTOR apparently recognized its erroneous application; it no longer appears as a topic. However, as with Kerber’s article, the addition ofGender rolesis a less obvious and more damaging mislabeling of a field of study. JSTOR topics have missed capturing crucial theoretical underpinnings and arguments in Snyder’s essay, and have seemed to present women’s history with rose-colored glasses that not only elide implications of struggle, conflict, and oppression, but in their new formulation, further erase Indigenous and African American women. While JSTOR’s responsive efforts are commendable, feminist and social justice workers have long argued that impact matters far more than intent [<a href="#utt2013">Utt 2013</a>]. Good intentions still lead to biased algorithmic results when programmers and chosen domain experts do not effectively or appropriately analyze scholarship.</p>
<p>The disconnect between JSTOR’s topics and what field experts would see as the significant content of these publications reflects ongoing discussions in digital humanities regarding algorithmic mediation and the role of classification versus content representation. With the rise of full text data mining capabilities, Library of Congress subject headings and similar controlled indexing vocabularies may seem to be too broad-brushed an approach for users accustomed to searching the internet and for exact strings of text. Full-text-based topic indexing holds the promise of using an author’s words to generate precise subject categorizations rather than slotting new work intoa prioritaxonomies. But as these examples show, more technological mediation does not necessarily lead to better outcomes. JSTOR has seemed to tinker with ways to improve its topic indexing, but it continues to fall short. Women-focused histories are still being categorized as focusing on men. Without topic terms that can capture sophisticated analytic content analysis of race and gender, JSTOR topics continue to misrepresent scholarly content.</p>
<h2 id="book-topics-additional-text-added-bias">Book Topics: Additional Text, Added Bias</h2>
<p>In recent years, JSTOR has expanded its corpus beyond journal articles to include digital versions of monograph and anthology chapters from a variety of academic publishers. This means that any inadvertent sexism and racism in algorithmic topic systems have potentially expanded to pollute book-length scholarship. One might think that longer texts divided into multiple chapters might ameliorate some of the errors of the article topic categorizations. Unfortunately, it appears that similarly problematic topic indexing has propagated these new genres of digital scholarship, expanding the bias presented to users.</p>
<p>Early American historian Ann Little has explained that her biography, <em>The Many Captivities of Esther Wheelright</em> , aims to move beyond privileging men’s recounting of and relationships in women’s lives. Little wrote Esther Wheelright’s biography to “tell the stories of the girls and women who loved her, clothed and fed her, educated her, worked and prayed with her, competed with her, and buried her” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#little2016"> [little2016] </a>. But JSTOR’s topic categories do not convey Little’s women-centered approach. A word cloud made up of the JSTOR topics listed for seven book chapters from <em>The Many Captivities</em> visually represent the topics assigned to the book’s chapters, with the size of words correlating to the number of times the topic appeared (<a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>).</p>
<p>As Figure 6 shows, neitherWomennorWomen’s historyappear as a topic for any of the chapters. Yet this is clearly a book focused on a woman. If we turn to the book’s full text, the most frequent word, appearing more than 1300 times, isher. In contrast,hisappears only about 300 times. In fact, of the top-10 most frequently used words in the book manuscript, six are related to women (her, Esther, she, Ursuline (an order of nuns), women, mother/s) and none to men.Motherswas identified as the most frequent JSTOR topic for Little’s book. Unfortunately, its topic frequency does not disambiguate Little’s very different usages of the word: while early sections of the book talk about familial mothering, most of the mentions ofmothers(more than 300 of the c. 445 occurrences) refers to the head of a female religious community. Indeed, the second most common bigram in the book wasMother Esther, and similarly,Sister Mariewas a top-ten most frequent bigram. Ideally, any meaningful topical categorization system would disambiguate word sense to avoid these kinds of pitfalls and omissions. This again may suggest that JSTOR has not effectively evaluated the need for disambiguation to accurately represent complex topics.</p>

<p>As in its topical assignments to articles, JSTOR&rsquo;s miscategorizations seem to be particularly problematic in relation to traditionally marginalized groups. Little’s book shows this erasure of Indigenous people, specifically. A substantial portion of Little’s book focuses on Wheelright’s interactions with the Wabanaki. The wordWabanakiappears over 400 times in the text, andIndianandNativeadd another 280+ appearances. (For comparison,Governorappears fewer than 100 times, but still appears as a JSTOR topic for multiple chapters.) Yet the only ethnicity-related topic JSTOR offers isWhite people, which is a topic assigned to three different chapters. The book’s chapter that focuses on Wheelwright’s captivity in a Wabanaki community where she was known as Mali includes extensive discussion of Wabanaki gender, social, and cultural practices. Yet of the eight topics assigned to that chapter, only one,Wigwams, relates directly to Indigenous people, even though it is mentioned fewer than two dozen times. This effectively reduces the central role of the Wabanaki and other Indigenous groups to mention of the material object of their housing. Most of the other topics assigned to that chapter relate to Catholicism, which seems to promote a Euro-centric and settler-colonial bias that erases Indigenous people.</p>
<p>These problems harm authors who have spent years thoughtfully framing their scholarship and reasonably expect that databases will allow others to accurately discover their content. When I shared JSTOR’s topic results and my word frequency analysis with Ann Little, she responded with deep frustration “that I apparently (successfully!) wrote a biography centering on girls and women&rsquo;s lives — as your word count shows — but all of that effort gets swallowed up by JSTOR&rsquo;s deeply flawed algorithm. How could it so deeply distort my book and misapprehend its purpose?” Moreover, she writes that “the near-total erasure of Wabanaki (Native American, First Nations), French Canadian, and Anglo-American people is also deeply concerning — it&rsquo;s as though JSTOR has its own view of what history is” .<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> JSTOR’s seeming tendency to apply topics that misrepresent content does not appear random. Without fully understanding JSTOR’s topical identification processes, I can only guess that, as Little suggests, it seems to be rooted in a lack of expert knowledge in the fields that it is seeking to topically identify. It may be that JSTOR, which covers an array of disciplines, does not have a system that engages experts from each field of study in the creation of a controlled vocabulary. But the result may be topic terms that misrepresent and misconstrue the content of publications. In this case, the focus of JSTOR’s topics on a seemingly monolithic presentation of Eurocentric terms in Little’s scholarship erases the intersectional and diverse communities her work presents.</p>
<p>Other books’ JSTOR topics show similar shortcomings surrounding content on gender and race. Jennifer Morgan’s <em>Laboring Women: Reproduction and Gender in New World Slavery</em> , is, as its title suggests, a study of enslaved women in the 16th-18th centuries. JSTOR identifiedMenas a chapter topic word seven times in butWomenonly five times – as is visually striking in<a href="#figure07">Figure 7</a>.SonandChildrenare topics, butDaughteris not. Topics do include some quasi-conceptual themes, such as the termsWomen’s rightsandGender equality, but it is hard to see how these are relevant terms for a study of enslaved women. It is also notable that JSTOR does not apply the topics ofRaceorRacismto <em>Laboring Women</em> . Moreover, the system ofSlaveryappears as a topic only once. Instead,SlavesandSlave ownershipare relatively frequent topics. But these two are not parallel categories. It would make more sense to have a topic ofSlave ownersorEnslavers— not the passive construction ofslave ownership— in opposition toEnslaved PeopleorSlaves. Having such unmatched categories sidesteps the reality that white people owned, traded, and tortured human beings under thatownershipcategory and erases the abhorrent power abuses inherent in enslavement. It also suggests a lack of awareness of the current state of the field. Historians of slavery have fought to recognize enslaved people as individuals first, and enslavement as a condition by referring toenslaved peoplerather thanslaves<a class="footnote-ref" href="#foreman2018"> [foreman2018] </a>.</p>

<p>The absence of conceptual categories such as race/racism raises serious concerns about the classification of historical scholarship. Historians do not just describe people; we make arguments about systems of power. For example, the publisher describes Daniel Livesay’s recent book, <em>Children of Uncertain Fortune: Mixed-Race Jamaicans in Britain and the Atlantic Family</em> as focusing on “the largely forgotten eighteenth-century migration of elite mixed-race individuals from Jamaica to Great Britain, <em>Children of Uncertain Fortune</em> reinterprets the evolution of British racial ideologies as a matter of negotiating family membership” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#uncpress2018"> [uncpress2018] </a>. This is a book about mixed-race individuals, racial ideologies, and the role of familial relationships across the Caribbean and Great Britain. Its assigned Library of Congress subjects also make clear that the book focuses on race: all 10 LOC subjects assigned to the book include the wordraceorracially mixed(<a href="#figure08">Figure 8</a>). Again, this is not to argue that LOC classification schemas are free of bias [See, for example,<a href="#berman2014">Berman 2014</a>,<a href="#dudley2015">Dudley 2015</a>,<a href="#hathroc2016">Hathcoc 2016</a>,<a href="#knowlton2005">Knowlton 2005</a>]. But Library of Congress subjects do provide another support for the centrality of race in this book.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, JSTOR’s topics for <em>Children of Uncertain Fortunes</em> are problematic. Not only are race, racism, racial mixture, or any related terms completely absent from JSTOR’s chapter topics, the most frequent topic phrase associated with the book’s contents isWhite People(<a href="#figure09">Figure 9</a>). Moreover, even though much of this book focuses on free people of color, there is no parallel focus onBlack Peopleor other appropriate terms to identify people of African descent. Instead, non-white people are presumably represented with the JSTOR’s repeated use of the topic ofSlaves.</p>

<p>JSTOR does apply the topic ofAfrican Americanonce – but this is a book about Jamaica and Britain, not North America, and I could only findAfrican Americanin the text one time (Afro-Caribbean appears somewhat more frequently). According to searches undertaken in the Kindle version of the book,Blackappears approximately 380 times, andSlaveabout 450 times, butBlack Peopledid not rate a topic whileSlavesrated one for multiple chapters. Africa/African appears in the text over 300 times, but also did not rate a category, whileBequests, which appeared under 100 times, did. Neither was there any topic related to mixed-race people, despite the termmixed(as in mixed-race, mixed heritage, mixed ancestry, etc) appearing almost 800 times. Of course, it is hard to make conclusive arguments about an entire book’s content from simple word counts. But between the book’s description, the LOC subject headings, and the above word frequencies, it does seem that JSTOR has flattened important historical differences into racial binaries. As importantly, it seems to employ algorithms that privilege whiteness, and can only see non-white people in terms of their enslavement, rather than as multidimensional human beings with specific ethnic and racial histories. By not focusing on conceptual categories that are central to historical scholarship, JSTOR’s topics do not effectively allow for discovery related to the central analytic accomplishments of this scholarship.</p>

<p>There is no question that JSTOR topic applications have an array of seemingly benign errors. In the scholarship discussed above, we might question the relevance of topics onSwords(<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>) andAcademic libraries(<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>), for example. One user publicly noted that an article with the phraseto bearerroneously was assigned a topic ofBears, again suggesting problems with disambiguation of word senses.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> In a response to another user sharing seemingly nonsensical JSTOR tags in March 2018, a JSTOR representative responded that “We reviews [sic] those each weed [sic] to make updates to our rules.” ). Besides, I imagine, cursing Twitter’s no-editing-post-tweet rule, JSTOR representatives do seem to take individual error notifications under advisement and seek to improve the system. Matthew Reidsma reported having similar experiences with offering feedback on questionable results to ProQuest<a class="footnote-ref" href="#reidsma2016"> [reidsma2016] </a>.</p>
<p>The need to gather user feedback for new categorization systems is understandable. At the same time, what responsibility do organizations – let alone one that charges Universities hundreds of thousands of dollars - have to evaluate even an admittedly experimental system for racism and sexism before widely releasing it<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jstor2019c"> [jstor2019c] </a>? JSTOR has known that there are problems surrounding these issues since at least 2017 (See<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). Ad hoc attention to user concerns does not seem to be a best practice. A lacking systemic response to racist or sexist algorithmic results is, unfortunately, all too common<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wachter-boettcher2017"> [wachter-boettcher2017] </a>.</p>
<p>Users clicking through topics should have reasonable expectations of accuracy and lack of bias. While it may be easy to understand that the characterization ofBearsin a piece discussing bearing arms is incorrect, it is more concerning when topics <em>seem</em> accurate, but are actually marginalizing and misrepresenting women and non-white people. JSTOR has created a system that can produce topics, but perhaps has not fully evaluated whether those topics have appropriate disciplinary meaning, nor whether their use of mainstream sources like Wikipedia or DPedia may have introduced an array of racist and sexist terminology and beliefs.</p>
<p>Moreover, when feminist scholars publicly raised these issues with JSTOR, there seemed to be a sense – in line with their exclamation-pointed “Let us Know!” topic list suggestion – that users will volunteer constructive feedback to help improve their system. JSTOR states it has worked with 30 subject matter experts who “volunteer their assistance” and proclaims that “We are also always happy to talk to Subject Matter Experts about particular vocabularies. If you have suggestions or want to talk to us about the thesaurus, email us” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#jstor2019a"> [jstor2019a] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#jstor2019b"> [jstor2019b] </a>. Given that users pay (either individually or through an institution) for access to JSTOR’s various databases, this seems particularly problematic. JSTOR may be not-for-profit, but it is not a volunteer organization. And asking female scholars who have already identified issues of sexism and racism in JSTOR’s system to spend morepro bonotime working on a solution conveys a regrettable lack of understanding of the unrecognized service work regularly expected of women in academia<a class="footnote-ref" href="#guarino2017"> [guarino2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#babcock2018"> [babcock2018] </a>.</p>
<p>Safiya Noble astutely advises that we “ask ourselves what it means in practical terms to search for concepts about gender, race, and ethnicity only to find information lacking or misrepresentative, whether in the library database or on the open web” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#noble2018"> [noble2018] </a>. I have no reason to believe that JSTOR’s problems are rooted in purposeful racism and sexism. But ultimately, that is irrelevant to their results. The examples I have offered here of problematic JSTOR topics suggests that its taxonomers and programmers have perhaps not adequately addressed Noble’s questions. If, as it seems, these kind of biases are widespread, JSTOR appears to be abdicating its responsibilities to provide a non-racist and non-sexist product. Such shortcomings when programming a complex system may be understandable but they should not be acceptable. They are structural issues that need to be addressed beyond inviting crowd-source error finding.</p>
<p>The topics assigned to the articles and books I analyzed here suggest that JSTOR fails particularly well in reference to marginalized histories: for women, for Africans and African Americans, and for Native Americans. Articles on women’s history are assigned the topic ofMen, which is not even a particularly relevant topic of analysis in historical study. Scholarship on Africa and people of African descent are miscategorized as being about African Americans, who are then assumed to be relegated to a presumed slave status. Indigenous people are viewed through settler colonial and Eurocentric perspectives. Important conceptual categories like race and gender are elided or erased.</p>
<p>Shortcomings in JSTOR’s topic classifications raise an array of ethical questions. JSTOR only exists because scholars’ intellectual labor fills its database. What does JSTOR owe in return when it classifies and categorizes the fruits of that labor? Moreover, JSTOR promotes its topic system as particularly useful for students<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jstor2018"> [jstor2018] </a>. I, as a scholar with decades of domain expertise, can easily look at the categorizations of Jennifer Morgan&rsquo;s “Some Could Suckle” article and know that it is about Africans, not African Americans. Or that the topic of women is not equivalent to the analytic category of gender. But for students who are an ostensible target audience for topical offerings, JSTOR is providing problematic information.</p>
<p>It matters that I came across this problem organically, in the course of reviewing the field of early American women’s history because it suggests that JSTOR’s racist and sexist biases may affect others interested in race and gender as historical constructs. One of the challenges for ever-expanding digital document providers is how to offer useful access to their contents. The staff who are tasked with creating the systems that produce these topics no doubt work to the best of their ability because they believe that knowledge preservation and retrieval methods matter. The solutions, then, are far more complex thandon’t be racist/sexist. This is not about individual responsibility; it is about structural failings. How we can search relates to the scholarship we can find and the knowledge that we produce.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised if the biases I have identified may also reflect broader problems with JSTOR’s topic algorithms, relevant to those outside the fields of early American history. For example, on July 5, 2019, clicking on the JSTOR topic ofMenreturned “Variation in Women’s Success across PhD Programs in Economics” as the most relevant scholarship. Several days later (July 8, 2019), the most relevant article under the topicMenwas listed as “Women in the medieval wall paintings of Canterbury cathedral” . What does it say about JSTOR’s topic-producing algorithms that scholarship that very much appears to be focused on women are the top results for the category ofMen? I suspect more research would show other kinds of broad classification problems that shade into bias. For instance, the most relevant result when clicking on the topicWhite Peopleis a chapter from a book on <em>Martin Luther King Jr’s Theory of Political Service</em> . The top result ofWhite American Culture(a problematic category itself) is an article on “Langston Hughes, African American Literature, and the Religious Futures of Black Studies” . These kinds of miscategorizations risk derailing inexperienced researchers, curtailing the use of JSTOR’s resources, and ultimately making important scholarship less easily discoverable than it should be by categorizing scholarship on women and African Americans as being most relevant to topics about men and white people.</p>
<p>I hesitate to move beyond my critique to offer concrete solutions to JSTOR’s practices both because I have only a limited sense of what JSTOR practices entail, and a much better sense of my own limitations, which include only passing knowledge of classification systems, taxonomy, database design, and the multiple needs of a massive multi-disciplinary project like JSTOR. That said, I can comment as an end user on the ways that JSTOR topics do and do not serve scholars’ research and teaching needs, particularly in light of recent scholarship on such issues in a variety of big data systems.</p>
<p>Algorithmic transparency and algorithmic accountability have been burgeoning research areas, as theorists struggle to see the far-reaching consequences of big data machine learning technologies – what some have termed the “social power of algorithms” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gillespie2015"> [gillespie2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#dickey2017"> [dickey2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#neyland2017"> [neyland2017] </a>. Some have focused on engineering-type solutions, suggesting ways to improve algorithmic decision making by identifying moments of bias entry (i.e., training data bias, algorithmic focus bias, algorithmic processing bias, transfer content bias, interpretation bias, non-transparency of bias)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#silva2018"> [silva2018] </a>. Others have suggested how construction of ethical workflows might ameliorate inadvertently ideological outcomes or a “practical algorithmic ethics” that can be used to analyze the virtues and consequences of individual algorithms<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hepworth2018"> [hepworth2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#sandvig2016"> [sandvig2016] </a>. While some technology and society scholars have pushed for transparency in computer algorithms, others have noted that transparency does not negate biased outcomes.</p>
<p>Some scholars have suggested that wishing for unbiased classification systems is heading down a mistaken path. Feminist and queer studies writers have proposed various theoretical rethinkings of how we view metadata. Librarian Emily Drabinski suggests alternatives to the notion that biases can be corrected and classification systems can be made objective. Instead, she employs queer theory to suggest “new ways of thinking about how to be ethically and politically engaged on behalf of marginal knowledge formation” . She argues that we should to “teach knowledge production as a contested project” so that users recognize and engage the bias in knowledge organization systems, rather than expecting functional solutions to cataloguing bias<a class="footnote-ref" href="#drabinski2013"> [drabinski2013] </a>. Teaching students numerous search tactics – and how to recognize problematic search results – are valuable cross-disciplinary skills to impart<a class="footnote-ref" href="#grey2012"> [grey2012] </a>. While this end-user-interrogation approach is a useful one, it is not likely to be entirely successful, particularly when there is not algorithmic transparency. Drabinski herself recognizes that “privatized corporate algorithms” make information organization “less and less apprehendable” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#drabinski2016"> [drabinski2016] </a>. Similar to Drabinski’s theoretical approach, Anupam Chander suggests instead a “transparency of inputs and results” that will make visible the discriminatory production, rather than eliminate it<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chander2017"> [chander2017] </a>. Being aware of common classification biases – even if we cannot know their exact production process — offers one path to becoming a more thoughtful user of academic discovery systems.</p>
<p>Matthew Reidsma, one of the leading investigators of bias in library discovery systems, agrees with the need for user interrogation, and simultaneously proposes several areas of specific improvements. These include paying attention to the degree to which our searches are powered by proxies for the information we request; less unthinking trust in algorithms; increased diversity among programmers; working toward an algorithmic ethics; and intentional audits of software tools<a class="footnote-ref" href="#reidsma2019"> [reidsma2019] </a>. Similarly, I can imagine practical solutions that reshape the relationship between institutional consumers and database providers. JSTOR, as a not-for-profit organization, may have more obligation than privately owned digital document providers to live up to academic community standards. As the recent University of California resistance to publishing giant, Elsevier, has shown, universities can marshall their considerable power as consumers to insist on a range of standards that are in line with their own values and priorities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mckenzie2019"> [mckenzie2019] </a>.</p>
<p>Just because JSTOR can create topics does not mean that it offers useful metadata across fields of scholarship. It might be valuable to rethink the metadata sources and subject expert review processes that JSTOR currently practices. In the era of PhD training that moves beyond professorial careers, perhaps JSTOR could partner with professional organizations to offer internships that pair PhD students in specific fields with library and information science experts to review subject-based metadata. This might help evaluate the degree to which topics from the JSTOR Thesaurus’s controlled vocabulary meet standards for appropriacy (is a given term appropriate for the target audience?) and currency (does it reflect current common usage?). For scholars of women, race and colonialism, at least, the answer currently appears to be no for too many of JSTOR’s topic categorizations.</p>
<p>A commitment to changes in and increased transparency of review processes might also be a positive step. JSTOR does make individual changes when users point to errors. But it seems unprepared to deal with a wholescale review of the ways that their topic assignments foreground inadvertent sexism and racism, and may lack structural due diligence against bias. JSTOR prides itself on “enhancing its content with strong metadata” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#humphrey2019"> [humphrey2019] </a>. It is not clear that its current topic system meets that standard. Perhaps involving end users more systematically (beyond thumbs up/thumbs down and ad hoc communications) would promote a more transparent knowledge organization system. Scholars have pointed specifically to the need to “expand the boundaries of LIS [Library Information Systems]” to better understand the “ways in which tools impact the research process” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#manoff2015"> [manoff2015] </a>. Ultimately, JSTOR is a crucial resource for historians and other scholars, students, and educators. It may be easy for an outsider to find shortcomings, but finding solutions is far from an individual task. Raising awareness of these kinds of biases can encourage academic communities to work with JSTOR and other digital providers to create systems that better reflect the scholarship on which they build their systems.</p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>European medieval manuscripts represent one of the most significant treasures of human culture and society, revealing rich information about the past that is invaluable to historical research. History, art history, literature and philology, codicology and palaeography, all rely on the analysis of manuscripts, and scholars in these disciplines engage with these objects in unique ways. However, whether the main focus may be the handwritten document in its physicality or the textual content of the manuscript, “‘the first level of enquiry always is (or should be) the document, the physical support that lies in front of the scholar’s eyes’” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#pierazzo2010"> [pierazzo2010] </a>. The physical — i.e. codicological and palaeographical — details of a manuscript play a pivotal role not only in the identification and study of the handwritten source, but also enable the scholar to reconstruct a particular social and cultural context. Research related to handwritten primary sources is thus dependent on the descriptions of manuscripts. These descriptions aim to provide a faithful reconstruction of a manuscript by expressing its formal structure in a technical language also made of abbreviations andformulae<a class="footnote-ref" href="#petrucci1984"> [petrucci1984] </a>. According to Italian cataloguing practice, after a first outline of the externalfacieseach description should delineate the history of the codex, the texts contained within it and finally the bibliography for research on the manuscript<a class="footnote-ref" href="#petrucci1984"> [petrucci1984] </a>.</p>
<p>Today, XML-encoded analytic descriptions of the physical and intellectual nature of manuscripts work as digital surrogates of these artifacts while enabling the knowledge contained in these descriptions to be interrelated and thus potentially compared by users. Indeed, as stressed by Stinson<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stinson2009"> [stinson2009] </a>, the purpose of the cataloguing itself has slightly changed with its translation to the digital environment. In a setting where facsimile images can be often accessed to visualise the original artifacts, descriptions have gained a new level of usefulness: they serve as “a means for sorting, classifying, and comparing collections of manuscripts” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#stinson2009"> [stinson2009] </a>because, even when digital images are available to scholars, “without metadata, there is no access and no meaning” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#fabian2016"> [fabian2016] </a>. The result of the online descriptive records is that hypertext information is now searchable, potentially linked, making comparisons among manuscripts easier. However, the interrelation of intellectual objects “requires creating explicit machine-readable data that allow automated correlation or collocation of related resources” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#pitti2004"> [pitti2004] </a>. European cultural heritage institutions recognise the need to create metadata; nevertheless, the lack of automated correlation is a major challenge to the creation of timely and granular metadata for medieval manuscript descriptions. Specifically, the heterogeneity of codicological-paleographical records in terms of metadata and terminology is weakening the integration and interoperability within the community.</p>
<p>This paper<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> focuses on one approach that has been proposed against this unstandardised setting: the Semantic Web addresses metadata automation because of its potential to leverage ontologies as means to more effectively connect medieval manuscript data according to its semantics. At present, although the valuable role of computational ontologies is getting interest in the broader Humanities, the employment of these recent developments in knowledge representation is still narrow in the field of medieval manuscript descriptions, which always require an “ad hoc” consideration due to the peculiar data they examine<a class="footnote-ref" href="#barbero2013"> [barbero2013] </a>. Against this scenario, this paper concentrates on primary sources coming from the Middle Ages, and it explores the impact of a top-level ontology designed for modelling cultural objects, namely <em>CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model</em> , on a specific set of Italian manuscript descriptions. Though limited in the extent of its examination, this case study attempts to add evidence and potentially further the analysis and implementation of ontologies on codicological-paleographical catalogue records.</p>
<h2 id="2-medieval-manuscript-descriptions-an-unstandardised-setting">2. Medieval manuscript descriptions: an unstandardised setting</h2>
<h2 id="metadata-standards">Metadata standards</h2>
<p>Medieval manuscripts can be described within general databases, such as a library’s collection database, or specific manuscript databases. In the former context, records about a collection of manuscripts might be encoded in bibliographic technical and structural standards, as – for example – <em>MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data</em> or <em>UNIMARC</em> . In contrast, most of the significant European catalogues use the <em>Text Encoding Initiative</em> ( <em>TEI P5</em> ) standard to encode metadata about their medieval manuscripts. Specifically, the <em>TEI Manuscript Description</em> element ( <em><msDesc></em> ) arose to meet the needs of the European manuscript cataloguing tradition in terms of both the logical macrostructure of the records and the content of each field. Nevertheless, despite the functionalities in <em>TEI</em> , a unique standard has not been universally established and a variety of metadata schemas can thus be encountered when studying this domain.</p>
<h2 id="granularity-of-the-records">Granularity of the records</h2>
<p>The semantic and syntactical nature of XML provides many opportunities for encoding granular and extensible records, which offers many unique opportunities for data about medieval manuscripts. Moreover, the <em>TEI</em>  <em><msDesc></em> module documentation, which proposes general guidelines rather than precise rules, also accommodates flexibility on the amount of information to be included. In the context of networking and interoperability this “different levels/depth of manuscript descriptions” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#uhlir2009"> [uhlir2009] </a>is one of the main challenges towards the metadata crosswalk.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p><em>TEI</em> is a complex schema, which means, to analyse <em>TEI</em> records, we need a clear understanding of elements and terminology. A first level of inconsistency depends on the variety of data schemas that can be adopted in this domain: some <em>TEI</em> elements could be similar to those of a customized data structure or the <em>MARC 21</em> standard, but they may not use the exact same terms. Taking into account how multilingualism complicates this framework on a further level<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burrows2011"> [burrows2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#humphrey2007"> [humphrey2007] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#kummer2011"> [kummer2011] </a>. The language of manuscript catalogues varies from country to country; furthermore, expert palaeographers tend to make terminological choices according to their sub-domains and contexts<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hassner2012"> [hassner2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#petrucci1984"> [petrucci1984] </a>, consequently causing an heterogeneous and unstandardised vocabulary in terms of handwriting.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-methods-in-_tei_-standard">Encoding methods in <em>TEI</em> standard</h2>
<p>Barbero and Trasselli<a class="footnote-ref" href="#barbero2014"> [barbero2014] </a>highlighted critical aspects about the encoding of some codicological data in <em>TEI</em> format. According to their analysis, when creating records for manuscripts material, the number of folios and size of leaves are particularly exposed to differences in description. Furthermore, they emphasized that a single procedure about how to structure each information is not provided by the <em>TEI Guidelines</em> and this factor represents an obstacle towards the desirable data sharing.</p>
<h2 id="3-current-proposals-semantic-web-and-ontologies">3. Current proposals: Semantic Web and ontologies</h2>
<p>Research on Semantic Web technologies has produced insights into the challenges associated with standardizing metadata for manuscripts. In particular, the application of ontologies in the domain of codicological and paleographical data has been evaluated as a clever approach towards better communication within the community. A clarification about what ontology means in this context, and its relation with the Semantic Web and Linked Data, constitutes a preliminary step in understanding which benefits ontologies can offer to the complex framework outlined in<a href="#section2">Section 2</a>.</p>
<p>The wordontologyin a computational sense is derived from a long established tradition in the philosophical field, namely the concept - introduced by Aristotle - of “a particular system of categories accounting for a certain vision of the world” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#guarino1998"> [guarino1998] </a>. Though preserving a close link to its source, the computer science community has adapted the term to the digital environment to describe an engineering artifact which can be defined as a “formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#studer1998"> [studer1998] </a>. Conceptualisation is the backbone of an ontology<a class="footnote-ref" href="#guarino2009"> [guarino2009] </a>: consisting of an abstract model of the state of affairs of a certain area of interest, an ontology takes the objects, concepts and other relevant entities of this area and it explicitly defines them and the relationships among them<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> . In order to be calledontology, the model needs to reflect “‘a certain rate of consensus about the knowledge in that domain’” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#studer1998"> [studer1998] </a>, and therefore to express a view accepted by that specific community rather than by an individual. Finally, the ontology has to be given in a formal language, that is in a machine-readable format. The overall result is a set of logical axioms usually based on the so-called Description Logics, a formal language for the knowledge representation that gives the capability of deducing new information from an explicated group of data<a class="footnote-ref" href="#biagetti2016"> [biagetti2016] </a>. As a consequence of the aforementioned logical foundations, information integration and exchange are the main valuable tasks that ontologies can perform. They capture and model a shared understanding of a domain, making explicit the inherent semantics and thus avoiding ambiguous meanings. In doing so, they act as a medium for knowledge sharing and communication not only among resources of an area but also over different systems.</p>
<p>Thanks to their nature, ontologies have played a fundamental role in the development of the Semantic Web. The concept of the Semantic Web, or “Web of Data” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#W3Cb2015"> [W3Cb2015] </a>, was publicly conceived in the early 2000s as an extension of the World Wide Web able to automatically read and process data and information without human intervention<a class="footnote-ref" href="#berners-lee2001"> [berners-lee2001] </a>. From the very first, the essential requirement for this task was that the meaning — i.e. the semantics — of Web data should have been explicated in a machine-readable format in order to allow computers to discover, manipulate and link information from heterogeneous sources<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hitzler2010"> [hitzler2010] </a>. Ontologies thus became a basic component of the Semantic Web, since they provide meaningful identifications of concepts and relationships and help data to be powerfully searched, integrated and exchanged<a class="footnote-ref" href="#taye2010"> [taye2010] </a>. The achievement of such a framework needed a set of established standards and technologies to create relationships among different datasets and thus formally explain computers how to access and associate the information<a class="footnote-ref" href="#W3Ca2015"> [W3Ca2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#yoose2013"> [yoose2013] </a>. The termLinked Datarefers to this technical set.</p>
<p>The role of the ontologies of sharing a common knowledge representation and rendering “domain assumptions explicit” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#noy2001"> [noy2001] </a>has been assessed by Burrows<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burrows2011"> [burrows2011] </a>and Kummer<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kummer2011"> [kummer2011] </a>a significant opportunity to enhance the interoperability and connection in the body of knowledge of medieval manuscripts. Albeit referring to a broader range than the single manuscript descriptions, in Burrow’s opinion the coexistence of different data structure standards could be overcome by making explicit the semantic categories (as names, concepts, events) embedded in resources about manuscripts. Unique identifiers for each of these entities could allow an interlinked environment where data within heterogeneous resources point to them. Envisioning which contribution the Semantic Web could bring to codicology, Kummer has discussed a similar approach. He has considered how the application of a specific ontology designed within the cultural heritage, the <em>CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model</em> ( <em>CIDOC CRM</em> ), could integrate data and “support communication processes” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#kummer2011"> [kummer2011] </a>. The fact that <em>CIDOC CRM</em> concentrates “on contextualization of objects” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#kummer2011"> [kummer2011] </a>and allows different opinions and uncertain information to be encoded together, has been argued to fit well with the codicological framework. In regard to the first aspect, the core of this ontology is indeed represented by the events, a basic concept which allows to integrate facts, objects, actors, places<a class="footnote-ref" href="#doerr2003"> [doerr2003] </a>.</p>
<p>In the same way, the terminological aspect which challenges the medieval manuscripts area has found in the Semantic Web techniques a possible resolution. Whether considering the perspective of multiple national languages or recognising that an established palaeographical vocabulary still misses, scholars seem to agree that an ontology could represent a valuable answer because it could be able to align different vocabularies in a conceptual map<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burrows2011"> [burrows2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#hassner2012"> [hassner2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#kummer2011"> [kummer2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#uhlir2009"> [uhlir2009] </a>. In two cases the <em>SKOS</em> standard has been suggested as the appropriate format for this mapping.</p>
<p>Although many points of analysis could have been explored in the research area of this paper, Kummer’s proposal of testing the suitability of <em>CIDOC CRM</em> to codicological data was particularly taken into account. Indeed, it was investigated how <em>CIDOC CRM</em> could address some of the challenges that<a href="#section2">Section 2</a>has outlined.<a href="#section4">Section 4</a>illustrates this introductory analysis in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="4-a-case-study-methodological-premises-and-approach">4. A case study: methodological premises and approach</h2>
<h2 id="41-_manusonline_-and-two-special-projects">4.1. <em>ManusOnLine</em> and two “special projects”</h2>
<p><em>ManusOnLine</em> (or <em>MOL</em> ) constitutes the outcome of the most significant Italian proposal towards a standardised manuscript cataloguing. Inaugurated in 2007, it is the first Italian online software developed for the encoding of manuscript descriptions<a class="footnote-ref" href="#barbero2014"> [barbero2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#marcuccio2010"> [marcuccio2010] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#merolla2014"> [merolla2014] </a>. To date, 415 cultural heritage institutions use this relational database to create descriptions of their manuscripts and make freely accessible their data on the web, in some cases also providing digital images. In order to provide libraries and research institutions with the same data they have produced, in 2012 <em>MOL</em> then developed an application to export manuscript descriptions as <em>TEI XML</em> files.</p>
<p>Taking into account the more complex and various European settings previously described, it could be properly argued that the focus on a single schema and encoding method challenges the validity of the outcomes of an ontology implementation. It is thus important to stress some considerations. On the one hand, scholars’ judgements on the appropriateness of <em>TEI</em> in this domain were considered as an argument in favour of the first aspect. Moreover, as it will be further presented, a special research has been started about the harmonization between <em>TEI</em> and <em>CIDOC CRM</em> (see<a href="#section5.2">Section 5.2</a>). In view of <em>CIDOC CRM</em> as the ontology selected for this case study, this was viewed as an additional reason. On the other hand, a uniform encoding method was preferred according to the necessity of a homogeneous corpus on where to focus the analysis. A level of variety, although different, was intended to be added by the following characteristic.</p>
<p><em>MOL</em> provides a further grade of cooperation. It allows specialised research projects to use its software for the cataloguing while consenting them to keep a total autonomy in the management of their records<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ICCU2017"> [ICCU2017] </a>. Two of these projects which are collaborating with <em>MOL</em> are <em>Censimento Internazionale Manoscritti Francescani</em> ( <em>International Census of Franciscan Manuscripts</em> ), and the <em>Illuminated Dante Project</em> (or <em>IDP</em> ). The first one, supervised by the <em>International Society of Franciscan Studies of Assisi</em> , aims to gather together the textual tradition of the thirteenth-fourteenth century Franciscan sources belonging to different literary genres and hold in Italian and foreign cultural institutions<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ICCU2017"> [ICCU2017] </a>. Alternatively, the <em>IDP</em> will create by 2021 the most comprehensive online archive of those manuscripts of Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em> containing illustrations and dating to the fourteenth-fifteenth centuries. This archive will provide their codicological and iconographic descriptions as well as high-definition images<a class="footnote-ref" href="#AIUCD2016"> [AIUCD2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#IDP2017"> [IDP2017] </a>.</p>
<p>Commonly, the granularity and depth of descriptions is influenced by the decisions made by each project’s cataloguers: the general guiding purpose affects the meticulousness of the cataloguing activity. These two projects can represent two examples: whereas <em>IDP</em> is based on thorough and complete first-hand descriptions that have required the supplement of new codicological-paleographical fields in <em>MOL</em> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#AIUCD2016"> [AIUCD2016] </a>, the <em>International Census of the Franciscan Manuscripts</em> is only focused on the digitisation of existing printed catalogues<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ICCU2017"> [ICCU2017] </a>, often quite dated. It is also noteworthy to emphasise that, since it is a database for manuscripts in a broad extent, <em>MOL</em> itself allows a certain level of flexibility.</p>
<p>For the aspects aforementioned, the differences of these two special projects, while being founded on a common ground — i.e. <em>MOL</em> — assessed an interesting material on which to analyse the implementation of an ontology. This approach was led by the intent of collecting an “heterogeneous” dataset, although in a restricted sense, and disclosing the challenges that could emerge when dealing with singular documents as medieval manuscripts are. More precisely, the study was based on a subcorpus of fifteen manuscript descriptions belonging to both the projects (the list is provided in<a href="#appendix3">Appendix 3</a>).</p>
<h2 id="42-_cidoc-crm_">4.2. <em>CIDOC CRM</em></h2>
<p><em>CIDOC CRM</em> is an ontology specifically devoted to the domain of cultural objects. As a result, <em>CIDOC CRM</em> presents a modelling design that attempts to address the challenges produced by this kind of object: “‘imprecision, vagueness, lacunae’” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#zollner-weber2008"> [zollner-weber2008] </a>as well as context-dependency and multiple interpretations.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is a top-level ontology, meaning that it delineates general classes and properties, as events, places, actors, “which are independent of a particular problem or domain” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#guarino1998"> [guarino1998] </a>. However, in order to supply the needs of specific communities and applications, <em>CIDOC CRM</em> has been made potentially extensible. As many new sub-classes or sub-properties as required by each sub-domain can be added to the available classes and properties of the conceptual model<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stead2008"> [stead2008] </a>. This theoretical ground is particularly relevant when explored by the perspective of manuscript descriptions. On the one hand, the core classes and properties which sit at the top of the ontology should be valid for all the records despite their divergence in the granularity. Equally, more detail can later be included in the ontology. On the other hand, as was stressed by Kummer<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kummer2011"> [kummer2011] </a>, the possibility to incorporate different views on the same material is helpful for the uncertainty that in some cases affects the codicological-paleographical information, such as multi-interpretable dates or scribal hands.</p>
<p>Secondly, at the foundation of <em>CIDOC CRM</em> there is the aim of focusing on the semantics of data schemas, in particular the relationships that exist among the inherent concepts, rather than the terminology related to data encoded in these schemas<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ICOMCIDOC2017"> [ICOMCIDOC2017] </a>. For this reason, classes referring to the terminology ( <em>E41 Appellation</em> ) have been distinguished from the concepts underlying data<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stead2008"> [stead2008] </a>. The fact that medieval manuscript cataloguing often involves a significant diversification in the vocabulary, whether paleographical or simply linguistic, seems to find a support in <em>CIDOC CRM</em> ’s distinction between top-level semantics and terminology. Where an agreement on the terms to be used still misses, a correspondence between the concepts that sit behind those terms could instead be more easily obtained.</p>
<p>The implementation of <em>CIDOC CRM</em> sought to disclose to what extent the above articulated theoretical assumptions could be accepted within the constraints of the dataset selected as a case study. Nevertheless, the application and extension of an existing ontology on a specific dataset is a long and time-consuming work requiring great expertise both on the technologies and the domain knowledge of the materials. The approach which was undertaken within this case study should be thus rather viewed as an initial attempt which considered only the first step of this long process. Specifically, the semantics underlying the selected <em>TEI XML</em> -encoded manuscript descriptions of the <em>International Census of the Franciscan Manuscripts</em> and <em>IDP</em> were explored according to a subset of <em>CIDOC CRM</em> .</p>
<h2 id="5-implementing-_cidoc-crm_">5. Implementing <em>CIDOC CRM</em></h2>
<h2 id="51-preliminaries">5.1. Preliminaries</h2>
<p>The implementation of an ontology should always start from defining “its domain and scope” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#noy2001"> [noy2001] </a>. Answering the question “what knowledge do you want to represent” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hiebel2010"> [hiebel2010] </a>thus corresponds to the first primary step that needed to be performed. Within the high-level element <em>TEI</em>  <em><msDesc></em> , the components <em><msIdentifier></em> , <em><msContents></em> (with its potential series of <em><msItem></em> elements), <em><physDesc></em> , <em><history></em> , <em><additional></em> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> , <em><msPart></em> , together with more specialised tags that can occur within them, are used to define detailed descriptive data about a manuscript (see<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). Within the framework of potentially highly accurate records as promised by <em>MOL</em> , the approach chosen for this case study was to consider as much detail as possible, i.e. all the codicological, paleographical, textual and historical information encoded in the <em>TEI XML</em> descriptions of the specific set of manuscripts.</p>
<p>Once the decision about how general the ontology is going to be has been made, the desired information has to be mapped to the <em>CRM</em> classes and properties that best represent it<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hiebel2010"> [hiebel2010] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#theodoridou2016"> [theodoridou2016] </a>. It is at this second stage of the process that the examination of the event-centric principle — on which <em>CIDOC CRM</em> is founded — produced a further consideration. As stressed by Doerr and Kritsotaki<a class="footnote-ref" href="#doerr2006"> [doerr2006] </a>, the modelling of historical contexts in terms of events and processes can more effectively aggregate and link, through varied kinds of relationships, historical and cultural information. Indeed, history can be seen as a sequence of events “involving participation of people and things” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#doerr2006"> [doerr2006] </a>and the creation of cultural objects is placed within this process. It can be easily recognised that the same theoretical principle was not applied to the design of the <em>TEI</em> structure of a manuscript description. Within a <em>TEI XML</em> record, data related to the physical carrier, the intellectual content carried by it and the full historical process that brought a manuscript into existence is encoded separately. However, on the contrary, all this information overall composes a network of relationships: actors, materials, ideas have met in particular space-times and need to be linked in order to capture the historical context of a manuscript.</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a consequence, a conceptual re-arrangement of all the details contained in the manuscript descriptions was considered a pivotal step in order to more easily map the <em>TEI</em> metadata to <em>CIDOC CRM</em> ontology. In accordance with the <em>CIDOC CRM</em> event-modelling principle, the whole general sequence of activities which has as its outcome the current historical condition of a manuscript, both in its physical and intellectual nature, was split and analysed in its internal phases. The theoretical implementation of the ontology was performed according to this temporal order.</p>
<p>Regarding the practical mapping, <em>CIDOC CRM</em> does not provide any guidelines about how to integrate local schemas to the concepts defined in the ontology. The documentation of the standard only “defines the model on a purely conceptual level” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#nussbaumer2010"> [nussbaumer2010] </a>. Confronting with this lack, a way of performing the alignment of metadata with the ontology is the creation of “mapping chains” (or paths), i.e. “sequence[s] of semantically associated [ <em>CIDOC CRM</em> ] classes and properties, representing a specific concept” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#nussbaumer2010"> [nussbaumer2010] </a>. The binding of a manuscript – for example – can be represented by the following mapping chain: <em>E12 Production</em> - <em>P108 has produced</em> - <em>E22 Man-Made Object</em> - <em>P2 has type</em> - <em>E55 Type</em> : <em>Binding</em> . Within the framework of the analysed set of manuscripts, mapping paths were thus created for each concept occurring in each specific stage of the creation of a manuscript. While the chains are graphically displayed in<a href="#appendix1">Appendix 1</a>, the table in<a href="#appendix2">Appendix 2</a>schematically presents them<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> .</p>
<p>Finally, as previously delineated, <em>CIDOC CRM</em> is a potentially extensible ontology. In order to “preserve the original semantics and/or to uniquely identify the metadata information” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#nussbaumer2007"> [nussbaumer2007] </a>it allows – for instance – to sub-class existing classes. This sub-classing can be modelled through two approaches: by creating new sub-classes or by specialising and extending the class <em>E55 Type</em> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> introducing a domain-specific vocabulary. The first method is by all means more elaborate; the latter is ontologically easier and more time-saving. Also bearing in mind the “[m]inimality modelling principle of <em>CIDOC CRM</em> ” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#theodoridou2016"> [theodoridou2016] </a>according to which a new class should be created only if it requires new additional properties, for this case study the second method was evaluated the most appropriate. In particular, the values of the instances of <em>E55 Type</em> were drawn from the terminology provided by Muzerelle<a class="footnote-ref" href="#muzerelle2002"> [muzerelle2002] </a>. Although this online resource cannot be strictly considered a controlled vocabulary, it was positively assessed taking into account a possible multilingual integration of manuscript descriptions.</p>
<h2 id="52-mapping-and-its-evaluation">5.2. Mapping and its evaluation</h2>
<p>Since 2004, a unit within the <em>TEI Ontologies Special Interest Groups (SIGs)</em> has been focused on the relationship between <em>TEI</em> and <em>CIDOC CRM</em> standards towards a mapping of the elements of the former with classes and properties of the latter<a class="footnote-ref" href="#eide2010"> [eide2010] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#eide2014"> [eide2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#eide2006"> [eide2006] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#eide2007"> [eide2007] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ore2009"> [ore2009] </a>. Specifically, it has been underlined the development from <em>TEI P4</em> to <em>TEI P5</em> in including “new elements for marking-up real-world information” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ore2009"> [ore2009] </a>, as – for instance – <em><person></em> , <em><place></em> , <em><event></em> , <em><relation></em> , <em><name></em> . A comparison of these tags with <em>CIDOC CRM</em> conceptual model was then performed, attempting at the same time to propose different ways to interlink the two standards. Nevertheless, a great part of the cited articles are based on the assumption that the <em>TEI</em> documents representing the background of the analysis already contain marked-up real world information. This is actually not a standard characteristic. As underlined by Eide and Ore, it “is common to most <em>TEI</em> documents” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#eide2007"> [eide2007] </a>that – for example – “events are not tagged” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#eide2007"> [eide2007] </a>.</p>
<p>However, a manuscript description is a particular type of <em>TEI</em> document. It has been designed having in mind the implicit conceptual model at the base of the European cataloguing practice. Consequently, it can be inferred that each specialised <em>TEI</em> element has been introduced according to an agreed contextual meaning. Considering the <em>XML</em> structure of a manuscript description rather than its textual content, at least events and relations can be generally deduced although they are not expressively identified. The following example can serve as a better explanation. The identification of the copyist and especially the date of writing represent two of the main challenges faced by paleographers and codicologists when studying a manuscript<a class="footnote-ref" href="#petrucci1984"> [petrucci1984] </a>. This is due to the fact that, in most of the cases, the transcription of a text was carried out anonymously, without any temporal indication. However, an exception to this status quo is represented by the colophon, i.e. an original date (and name) handwritten by the copyist on the leaves during the stage of the handwriting. For its inherent semantics, the presence of a colophon ( <em>E34 Inscription</em> ) means that this final formula was added by a person ( <em>E21 Person</em> ), i.e. the copyist, __ and it may contain information able to identify ( <em>P67 refers to</em> ) the date of writing and the copyist himself, helping the scholar to provide his own hypothesis on the manuscript ( <em>P16 was used for - E13 Attribute Assignment</em> ) (see<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). Making explicit causal and temporal relationships, the overall mapping of the specific <em>TEI</em> records to <em>CIDOC CRM</em> was generally successful because of this aspect.</p>

</figure>
<p>The aforesaid reasoning needs further consideration, though. Events require to be placed in specific time frames and linked to identified actors in order to model factual information. If this data is not encoded in tags as <em><date></em> and <em><name></em> , individual histories of handwritten primary sources cannot be retrieved. This was the main drawback affecting the mapping process. In <em>MOL</em> records the presence of <em><name></em> was really sporadic and the use of <em><origDate></em> or <em><date></em> was limited – for instance – to the origin of a manuscript, the life of the text’s author and the date of a binding.</p>
<p>In reference to some of the aspects against which the choice of <em>CIDOC CRM</em> ontology was made, the described project was finally assessed as positive evidence. Firstly, the dissimilarities between bare and more accurate descriptions did not heavily affect the good outcome of the implementation. As a representative specimen, the conceptual identification of a comprehensive class for any kind of illumination occurring in a manuscript, distinct from its subtypes, allowed to model the different granularity of this category found in the analysed records. During the modelling, it was chosen to firstly sub-type the class <em>E55 Type</em> for classifying the physical feature holding the illumination, e.g. initial, leaf, frieze (encoded in the <em>TEI @type</em> attribute). Then, the class <em>E41 Appellation</em> was used to specify the conventional terms for describing a particular category (occurring in the <em>TEI</em>  <em>@subtype</em> attribute), whose semantic meaning is explained by the class <em>E36 Visual Item</em> (see<a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>).</p>

     ><figcaption>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An additional level of evaluation pertains the contradictory views. <em>CIDOC CRM</em> ontology enabled to distinguish facts that were asserted by the handwritten sources from those that, although based on these sources, were only “exhibited in or presupposed” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#eide2008"> [eide2008] </a>. An example is provided. Handwritten texts usually do not include titles, which thus need to be deduced through a scholar’s analysis of the content. However, it can happen that titles occur in a specific leaf and thus no interpretation is required. Two mappings of the title of a manuscript (see<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>) were thus needed in order to make a clear distinction between the factual and interpretative nature of information.</p>

     ><figcaption>
        <p>Different mappings for the two types of title.

</figure>
<p>Lastly, the use of the class <em>E55 Type</em> for representing the concepts of a codicological thesauri and the use of <em>E41 Appellation</em> for naming instances of classes “by convention, tradition, or agreement” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ICOMCIDOC2017"> [ICOMCIDOC2017] </a>showed that the distinction between concepts and terminology is actually possible. According to this principle, in the context of an heterogeneous vocabulary for handwriting scripts, it was possible to keep separate the concept of the style of script ( <em>E55 Type)</em> from – for example – the conventional namelittera textualis( <em>E41 Appellation)</em> (see<a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>).</p>

<h2 id="6-in-the-real-world--broader-considerations">6. In the “real world” : broader considerations</h2>
<p>The analysis presented in this paper was not performed on a comprehensive range of medieval manuscript descriptions encoded in different metadata schemas, neither did it involve the implementation of an ontology in all its required stages. If so, these choices would have let results have a more authoritative voice, highlighting at the same time a major level of complexity that the “real world” necessarily involves. The following paragraphs aim to introduce this broader context, stressing a potential affinity with other areas facing similar challenges.</p>
<p>Just considering <em>TEI</em> standard, individual customisations of the <em>TEI P5</em> manuscript description module would be the first hurdle to deal with during the investigation of heterogeneous manuscripts data. The proposal by Page et al.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#page2019"> [page2019] </a>of an intermediate, simplified and more rigid XML file, i.e. a selected list of metadata fields coming from an overall analysis of the source records, could be assessed as a feasible approach, representing a form of standardization where to focus the mapping to the ontology. Nevertheless, whatever workflow is chosen, the engagement of experts in expressing the processes and methods they used for encoding their data remains pivotal. Institutions who “precisely know the semantic definitions” of their schemas<a class="footnote-ref" href="#nussbaumer2010"> [nussbaumer2010] </a> “‘must be involved in encoding the meaning of their own information’” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#oldman2016"> [oldman2016] </a>. Equally, corporate bodies’ commitment to provide Linked Data versions of manuscript data should take into account the “semantic enrichment” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#zeng2019"> [zeng2019] </a>of their datasets values by linking their data to external authority files and controlled vocabularies. A web platform as the one developed by the <em>symogih.org</em> project<a class="footnote-ref" href="#beretta2017"> [beretta2017] </a>might be seen as the most straightforward path to this envisioned framework. In this user-friendly environment, data providers would be allowed to annotate their descriptions as well as to represent the embedded knowledge of their data structures “encoding knowledge units directly into texts” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#beretta2017"> [beretta2017] </a>— i.e. linking <em>TEI</em> tags to classes and properties of a <em>CIDOC CRM</em> -based ontology. On top of this platform a portal should then be implemented for exploring, searching and discovering the harmonized datasets and records. Nonetheless, all these infrastructural components would require noticeable long-term and large-scale efforts. As emphasized by Burrows, much more work on Linked Open Data has been made in the fields of Classics, Ancient History and LAM community, bringing into existence significant collaborative annotation platforms as <em>Pelagios</em> or <em>Perseus Digital Library</em> , whereas “this kind of framework for linking disparate resources is lacking for medieval and Renaissance studies” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#burrows2018"> [burrows2018] </a>.</p>
<p>Despite the above-mentioned considerations, the challenges in terms of infrastructure as well as human and economic resources should not overcome the potential benefits that such an implementation could involve. The introductory paragraphs of this article have underlined how “manuscripts form a crucial evidence base for the humanities, and research into their histories has important benefits for a wide range of disciplines” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#burrows2018"> [burrows2018] </a>, from social science to art history. The recognition of different scribal hands in the same manuscript – for instance – can help the understanding of its genesis and transmission, telling insightful knowledge about the monastery in which it was firstly written, its spheres of influence and its links. On the other hand, a valuable binding and a large presence of illuminated letters can reveal something about the social status of the family by whom the codex was commissioned. The possibility of searching across disparate databases on a single platform – thanks to semantic relationships such as those defined by <em>CIDOC CRM</em> – would enhance the quality, in terms of both discovery and analysis, of a great variety of large-scale qualitative investigations which researchers could be focused on.</p>
<h2 id="7-conclusions">7. Conclusions</h2>
<p>Semantic Web technologies provide the ability to more effectively connect and integrate structured data by disclosing their intended meaning and therefore making explicit their description, context and provenance. While allowing integration and interoperability across heterogeneous resources, one great benefit of the Semantic Web is that the local meaning of each of these resources is never lost and the source systems are not demanded for large changes: “semantics can be embedded (rather than described separately) within exactly the same structure” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#oldman2016"> [oldman2016] </a>. Within the context of medieval manuscript descriptions, the implementation of ontologies can represent a valuable enhancement of manuscript research. A growing number of semantically interlinked and automatically discoverable descriptions, though encoded by different institutions in a variety of standards and vocabularies, could firstly enable researchers to extend their query and thus their range of observation. At the same time, the unlimited retrieval of information could make scholars face unplanned discussions and questions.</p>
<p>The case study presented in this paper has been focused on one specific instance of medieval manuscript data lacking explicit semantics: the paleographical-codicological descriptions belonging to two different collections within the Italian catalogue <em>ManusOnLine</em> . The disclosing of relationships and concepts embedded in the tags of the analysed <em>TEI</em> records revealed that a deep domain-specific knowledge, i.e. the process of the creation of a manuscript and its involved terminology, is essential towards an effective mapping of this data to an ontology. Along with this, bringing under scrutiny the <em>TEI</em> encoding of data and the context of this information led to discerning, in an epistemological process, factual from categorical data. It has been also emphasized how abstract entities and properties of the suggested <em>CIDOC CRM</em> ontology allow individual interpretations.</p>
<p>Taking into account the limitations of this case study and its challenges, this initial theoretical attempt towards the proposed solution of the Semantic Web technologies to integrate an heterogeneous framework, as that of medieval manuscript descriptions, can be positively evaluated. However, there are still many problems that need to be addressed if considering a real-world implementation. But despite current and potential questions that demand to be investigated, tools are now available to achieve the promising outcome illustrated in the first paragraph of this conclusion. It remains to invest in Digital Humanities research and the cultural community in terms of interest, skills and collaborative work.</p>

Although I work at the Kinsey Institute Library and Special Collection as a graduate archivist and I am receiving the benefits of a traditional archival education, I have also been involved in independent and community archives for a number of years. Particularly, I have been working to preserve the communities and materials of marginalized groups from the generalized decay of the internet. <em>Rogue Archives</em> then, was a self-discovery. It also became an exploration: this book review was originally livetweeted as part of a year-long experiment to engage with authors and their communities while reading their work. As a result, this journal review will conclude with some thoughts on what the experience of a performative livetweetremixof an academic work is like for both the reviewer and the reviewed.</p>
<p>Beginning in a way that is now almost traditional for archival studies, De Kosnik proclaims that “memory has gone rogue &hellip; memory has <em>fallen into the hands of rogues</em> . From the late nineteenth through the late twentieth century, memory — not private, individual memory, but public, collective memory — was the domain of the state” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a>. Her work, she declares, is not about outdated and possibly moribund analog archives, but about a new type of digital archive that she sees as avant-garde, a precursor of what is to come across all of the humanities. Although archival scholars might take exception at some of her characterizations, De Kosnik is deliberately setting herroguearchives in definitional opposition totraditionalones — and also drawing heavily on media studies criticism.</p>
<p>The difference betweentraditionalandroguearchives, is sometimes hard to express as is witnessed by De Kosnik’s varying definitional approaches and levels of emphasis on one or more aspects throughout. Although another reader might complain about this drift, my feeling is that the subjects of the book are difficult to define and are sometimes deliberately boundary-challenging and queering. Regardless, the traits of rogue archives that are the most persistent from chapter to chapter are that they are: (1) largely run by people that do not have training or expertise in library and information studies, but dub themselves archivists; (2) available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to anyone with an internet connection; (3) nominally barrier-less to access; (4) ignorant, purposefully-ignorant, or maliciously ignorant of copyright laws and restrictions; (5) homes for “content that has never been, and would never likely be, contained in a traditional memory institution;” (6) home as well to people that have never been or would never likely be traditional; (7) identity-and culture-generating; and (8) achrontic and intertextual sites of identity and community performance, inspiration, reaffirmation, and repertoire<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a>. I will explore these traits further below.</p>
<p>There are a number of quibbles that can be taken with individual aspects of this definition. For example, one could argue that figures such as Henry Spencer Ashbee, the Victorian businessman-bibliophile who maintained an apartment in London filled with erotica and pornography and provided 24/7 access to select people, meets at least a few of the aspects of arogue archive. However, it would not be possible for <em>any</em> physical archive to meet all of the requirements to become a De Kosnikianroguearchive. That, I would argue, points us to one of the most essential features of rogue archives: they <em>must</em> be digital. Copyright also emerges as a central differentiator of rogue archives. Though De Kosnik includes some discussion of archives that limit themselves to public domain material (i.e. The Gutenberg Project), the majority of the book is aimed at the historical senses of rogue: “vagabond, mischievous, wayward, and anomalous” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#oed2019"> [oed2019] </a>. As many <em>DHQ</em> readers know,traditionalinstitutionally-affiliated digital archives like the Internet Archive or Whitman Archive cannot throw their concerns to the wind — they must be careful and sometimes overly-cautious about copyright infringement. However, they also have robust digital preservation frameworks and infrastructure in place to ensure the survivability of material for decades.</p>
<p><em>Rogue Archives</em> is structured in a rather unique way: each chapter is separated by what De Kosnik calls “breaks” , which “are more informal, some are more experimental, and the rest are simply less rounded-out and more fragmentary than the chapters,” which she says are more structured and written in a “straightforward academic style” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a>. For example, Chapter Two considers archival “styles” , which De Kosnik breaks down into a taxonomy of universal, community, and alternative. Universal archives “seek to replace canonicity and selective archiving” and the critics and experts that support and enable canons, with “comprehensive archiving, a process that strives to collect as many cultural texts as possible, to make all the texts equally accessible to the public, and to present all the texts as equally valuable” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a>. Community archives, by contrast, support the “canon-expansion work that was begun by university reformists, striving to assemble and preserve texts that originate from, or bear direct relevance to, cultures that have been historically marginalized” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a>. De Kosnik’s alternative archiving style, however, ignores this binary, proposing “new canons, canons of new types of objects or objects that are ignored… assemblies of odd, strange, controversial, nongeneric, or radically new texts stand alongside those older sets of privileged works” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a>.</p>
<p>Thebreakbetween Chapters Two and Three, called “Archive Elves” was identified as particularly moving by several practicing archivists and students. This break describes the constant, unyielding, and academically-unexamined work that goes into maintaining an archive. After a few pages of description of the endless, thankless, and repetitious tasks undertaken by archivists, De Kosnik points out that users, unaware of the amount of work that goes into digital projects, just assume that things work like magic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the nature of online infrastructuring is such that the infrastructure builders aim to make themselves and their work invisible, ghostly, and immaterial. If using a networked digital archive feels like using a magic memory machine, this is in part because both the server that stores data and serves it up on command, and theservers(archivists) who serve the archive users (on demand) and maintain the integrity of the archive, are concealed from the user’s view<br>
.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As any reader that has undertaken a significant amount of technical work can attest, this is true. Infrastructure also includes, I would point out, the text you are reading now: the eye-pleasing paragraphs that you are reading were worked into the screen via the TEI-encoded ‘magic’ of the editors of this journal. This review article is built on top of more than a decade’s worth of work by <em>DHQ</em> editors, volunteers, and archivists.</p>
<p>By positing a meditation on the nature of archival work between arguments about types of archival style and culture, De Kosnik cleverly and subtly reinforces her argument, which goes something like this: rogue archival work, which is carried out in specific ways by minoritized groups, <em>is</em> work, and it <em>is</em> different because <em>they</em> are different and <em>they</em> are preserving <em>their</em> cultures. That these meditative breaks when combined with chapters would serve as effective teaching modules, speaks to the strength of De Kosnik’s model. The result is a book that is an excellent teaching text for a number of disciplines and which may be of interest to DH educators.</p>
<p>The following chapters move away from theory and taxonomies in order to focus on a diverse series of case studies. De Kosnik’s examples range from file sharing networks to more-traditional (in content) digital archives like the South Asian American Digital Archive, FAMA Collection, the Radfem Archive, and others. Most important for <em>DHQ</em> readers and larger audiences is her examination of fan fiction, represented mostly by Archive of Our Own (AO3). This chapter documents a long history of internet fan fiction and fan culture, from the 1990s to present, which occurs in roughly three different phases: centralization (1990s-early 2000s), de-centralization into social media (early to mid 2000s), and re-centralization into queer and feminist fan-controlled archives (late 2000s to present).</p>
<p>The establishment of these queer and feminist sites, she convincingly argues in her closing chapters, provided homes and sites of discovery for minoritized individuals. For a number of reasons, these communities especially embraced “archontic production” , which is to say, in her first (2006) definitional attempt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fictional writings based on source texts, that is, texts that have been published; the writers of archontic literature are readers-turned-authors. Each source text is the foundation and core of an archive from which reader-authors make withdrawals (elements they wish to use) and into which they make deposits (their stories that incorporate those appropriated elements), thereby augmenting and enlarging the overarching archive.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a> <em>Rogue Archives</em> expands this definition to include “digital derivations” , encompassing “appropriative writings, soundtracks, still and moving images, audiovisual works, games, and codes… constitute[ing] a vast swath of digital culture today” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By engaging with these materials, minoritized groupsperformandproducethe archive, and the support they receive encourages the production of new performances. This chapter showcases De Kosnik’s insightful scholarship at its best, justifying the book’s $45.00 hardcover price. <em>Rogue Archives</em> breaks new ground in its documentation of a desperately under-researched topic and provides valuable insight to fields as diverse as fan studies, media studies, archiving, sexuality, history, archival theory, and internet culture — to mention a few.</p>
<p>Finally, De Kosnik strikes at the heart of modern and digitally-mediated humanity: social media. In De Kosnik’s view, social media — and perhaps even social identity — is a performance that can and should be studied. To extend that a little bit further, the irony that my livetweeted review of <em>Rogue Archives</em> can be (and was) read as a performance is not lost on me. Since the beginning of 2019, I have documented a number of book reviews that I have read through the lens of Twitter (much of which is available under the hashtag #tweetvaluation). The phenomenon of conference livetweeting has been examined, but I do not know of any other live-tweeted book reviews [Further Reading].</p>
<p>Part of the purpose behind the ongoing experiment is that I personally engage and learn better when in conversation with an audience — even an imagined one. Another reason is that it has allowed direct engagement with authors such as in this particularly poignant reply from the author herself:<br>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="ALT TEXT 1: tweet from [Abigail] @De_Kosnik to @HistoryOfPorn [the author’s previous twitter handle]: “you are making my whole year by live tweeting the book and I am so sad I have to stop following along as my flight is about to take off (I know yours is too) &#43; just want to say if I could lift the Tumblr porn ban and give it to you as a thank you gift I would.” Reply from author to @De_Kosnik: “😭 [Crying Emoji] the sweetest imaginary gift I&#39;ve ever been offered!

     >
</figure></p>
<p>Additionally, De Kosnik noted in a private message to the author that she enjoyed the experience of being livetweeted, and saw it as “an amazing archontic/remix work.” The review triggered other events, including book purchases or further authorial replies:</p>

<p>Most critically, live reviewing digitally recreates the experience of obsolete book culture. As historians of the book have noted, the reading of books prior to the twentieth century was a social, communal, and cultural experience. For example, in <em>The Social Life of Books</em> (2017), Abigail Williams documents how books were “the basis for communal entertainment, performance, and discussion” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#williams2017"> [williams2017] </a>. Even though solitary reading became increasingly popular through the century,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there were many reasons why individuals continued to read together. Some of these had to do with practical concerns [like lack of oil and candles, but also with] control over what was being read, and how…Women’s reading became associated with sofas and softness rather than with the intellectually rigorous upright reading of men, and young women were castigated for this unbecoming lounging.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#williams2017"> [williams2017] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To reword this into De Kosnik’s language, live reading is an ‘achronological archrontic production.’ This is the final point that I would like to demonstrate. One replier to my livethread remarked on the importance of the book to her own work:<br>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="@julesopolis [Julia de Cook, now assistant professor of Advocacy and Social Change in the School of Communication at Loyola University Chicago] to author and De Kosnik: “sorry to butt in and interrupt the book review: Rogue Archives is a fundamental part of the theoretical framing of my dissertation, which looks at extremist groups’ archiving practices online as a sustainability practice. Great review btw. [Sparkling heart emoji.]” De Kosnik, in reply: “[4 differently colored heart emojis] Thank you!!!!!!!!”" src=""
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw"
     srcset=" 500w,
     800w, w" 
     class="landscape"
     >
</figure></p>
<p>Indeed, this was taking place two days after the Christchurch Mosque Shootings, which demonstrated the result of rogue extremist archives, as I noted:<br>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="Two tweets from author’s twitter thread: “I really agree -- there are so so many exciting possibilities -- but the internet is a double-edged sword and not all good -- there are negative archives. f.ex: the digitization, online publication, and archiving of KKK material -- or the archives of hate material i know of.” “the effects have been demonstrated so strongly &amp; tragically recently -- and it is something we are too aware of at @askhistorians and elsewhere (this is not to say De Kosnik isn&#39;t aware of this, obvs -- she might even touch on it later, just my thoughts here!)”" src=""
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw"
     srcset=" 500w,
     800w, w" 
     class="landscape"
     >
</figure></p>
<p>The tweets demonstrate in a powerful way the double-edged nature of the internet. My only critique of <em>Rogue Archives</em> is to point out that such double-edgedness is overlooked. De Kosnik is perhaps too optimistic about the internet and rogue archives. For example, in discussing “The Promise of Democratization” , she offers a number of “exciting political possibilities” :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>vast quantities of cultural content [could] be preserved and made accessible to a broad public — marking an end to…the selective tradition,which always grants priority to the culture that supports the narratives and identities of the dominant group… The possibility formass audiencesto invert the sociocultural hierarchy that places them at the bottom of the power structure of media, and to exhibit, en masse, their ability to treat the culture industries’ products as the incomplete, often impoverished, basic matter from which they construct meaningful texts for themselves and their affinity-based communities.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dekosnik2016"> [dekosnik2016] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be unfair to De Kosnik to criticize her for failing to see the future — <em>Rogue Archives</em> was written before the election of Donald Trump. A contemporaryperformanceof it, though, is haunted by a spectre, a perverse Upside Down, where radicalized right-wing archives have also gone rogue. Rather than being a flaw, however, its autarchic world, more than anything else, is powerful evidence for the contemporaneity and even relevance of <em>Rogue Archives</em> : the understandings, tools, histories, and groundings laid out in this book can be used to understand the dark as well as the light. If memory, which is to say the humanities, has gone digitally rogue, then we must all beg, borrow, and steal in constructing the digital humanities. Rogues, after all, can steal from the rich as well as the poor.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Digital humanities has a definition addiction. In the decades since the formal inauguration of the term, rather than settle on a shared set of contours that encompass the field, definitions about what digital humanities is (and is not) have only proliferated. By the time Matthew Kirschenbaum wrote his definition in 2010, he had noted that pieces like his own were already an established genre<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kirschenbaum2010b"> [kirschenbaum2010b] </a>. One notable collection of definitions is a recent volume edited by Melissa Terras, Julianne Nyhan, and Edward Vanhoutte, <em>Defining Digital Humanities: A Reader</em> , which contains about twenty foundational definitions of the field<a class="footnote-ref" href="#terras2013"> [terras2013] </a>. In a useful and extensive addition to their book Terras, Nyhan, and Vanhoutte maintain an online bibliography of “Further Reading” , which is an ongoing list of definitions for digital humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#terras2013"> [terras2013] </a>. We used this bibliography as a starting point to build a corpus of 334 definitions which we topic modeled and visualized in order to get a meta-view of the discipline and its members.</p>
<p>We were particularly interested in taking this approach in order to analyze the welcome-mat/trapdoor dynamic that Ted Underwood introduced at his 2018 MLA presentation. Underwood describes entry into his sub-field of cultural analytics as encountering “a gentle welcome mat followed by a trapdoor” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#underwood2018"> [underwood2018] </a>. He argues that there is insufficient academic infrastructure to help new scholars become competent in cultural analytics. This lack of support has resulted in a field that is ostensibly open but is actually only available to those who have prior extracurricular experience in coding and statistics (which, he notes, is unevenly distributed). Underwood carefully kept his critique to cultural analytics, which he does not consider synonymous with digital humanities. However, even in areas of digital humanities that do not involve the “massive cultural datasets” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#manovich2016"> [manovich2016] </a>of cultural analytics, his argument seems to apply.</p>
<p>Stephen Ramsay’s well-known MLA talk from 2011 titled “Who’s in and Who’s out,” exemplifies Underwood’s welcome mat and trapdoor analogy. Ramsay’s talk, which is often read as an example of coding-as-gatekeeping in digital humanities, is more of an example of a simultaneous trapdoor <em>and</em> welcome mat. In the most infamous section, Ramsay states, “Do you have to know how to code? I’m a tenured professor of digital humanities, and I say yes ” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ramsay2011"> [ramsay2011] </a>. Even though he follows this statement by acknowledging that different advisors might have different answers to this question, this excerpt functions and feels like a trapdoor because it refuses admittance to those who do not program. Elsewhere in the same short piece, Ramsay takes an almost opposite stance, admitting that “the coding question is, for me, a canard.” What he thinks sets digital humanities apart is not coding, but building. He is “willing to entertain highly expansive definitions of what it means to build something,” which is a statement that functions more like a welcome mat by inviting people to try building of nearly any sort to enter the ranks of “who’s in.” Even in the most oft-quoted example of gatekeeping, then, one experiences not just a line drawn around what defines digital humanities for one person, but whiplash between a warm invitation to attempt new ways of building and cold exclusion for not knowing the correct tools to be a digital humanist.</p>
<p>This simultaneous push and pull, this invitation-in and guarding-of digital humanities exists in both field-wide definitions and individual methods. One technique in which this dynamic is evident is topic modeling. In the past few years, topic modeling has gone from being a “hot,” new method to existing solidly within the mainstream digital humanities toolkit. Topic modeling is so much associated with digital humanities that, at times, it seems like digital humanities is topic modeling. Scott Weingart and Elijah Meeks use it as a “synecdoche of digital humanities” in their special-issue introduction to topic modeling<a class="footnote-ref" href="#weingartmeeks2012"> [weingartmeeks2012] </a>. Christopher Schöch has stated that “Topic Modeling has proven immensely popular in Digital Humanities” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#schoch2017"> [schoch2017] </a>. Stephen Robertson even notes that “text mining and topic modeling are the predominant practices” within digital literary studies<a class="footnote-ref" href="#robertson2014"> [robertson2014] </a>. A myriad of informal introductions walks the novice through what topic modeling is and how one can do it. Explaining what topic modeling is has even become something of another sub-genre. There are many excellent and accessible summaries by prominent digital humanists detailing what the process entails and assumes<a class="footnote-ref" href="#weingart2012"> [weingart2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#posner2012b"> [posner2012b] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#jockers2011"> [jockers2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#underwood2012"> [underwood2012] </a>. These definitions and guides invite newcomers to use the method.</p>
<p>Despite the abundant and inviting walk-throughs, amateurs are warned away from this method as vigorously as they are invited to try it. Ben Schmidt warns that “simplifying topic models for humanists who will not (and should not) study the underlying algorithms creates an enormous potential for groundless — or even misleading — insights ” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#schmidt2013"> [schmidt2013] </a>. Andrew Goldstone warns of easy-entry digital humanities tools in general when he writes: “DH should be wary of promises of ease: in prepackaged tools, in well-meaning introductory tutorials and workshops that necessarily stop short of what a researcher would need to draw conclusions, in rationalizations of inconclusive arguments as exploration, play, or productive failure” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#goldstone2017"> [goldstone2017] </a>.</p>
<p>This simultaneous invitation and warning away is a confounding feature of precisely those areas in digital humanities which established scholars have used to draw lines around the field. One has to learn a little command line, R, or Python to run and visualize the results of a topic model. With all the manuals and textbooks available, topic modeling could be a relatively painless way to earn one’s entry into digital humanities and satisfy any remaining naysayers who demand or imply that digital humanists know how to code. However, approaching it also puts newcomers in the position of the magician’s apprentice: is this going to be a tool that gets out of our control and wreaks havoc on our scholarship and our reputation in the very field we are trying to enter?</p>
<p>This article explores a series of topic models run by relative newcomers to digital humanities who encountered both a welcome mat and potentially a trap door. At the time of carrying out this project, we were a group of one postdoc and three graduate students in various humanities fields who learned topic modeling together through Matthew Jockers’ introductory book<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jockers2014"> [jockers2014] </a>and a DHSI session on topic modeling. Starting from Melissa Terras’ bibliography on “Defining Digital Humanities” and adding non-redundant entries from Elijah Meeks’ conceptual map of DH<a class="footnote-ref" href="#meeks2011"> [meeks2011] </a>, we collected and curated a corpus of full-text digital humanities definitions as .txt files as well as 15 different metadata fields such as department, career stage, institution, etc. for each definition’s authors. This set of texts is not a comprehensive list of definitions within digital humanities. It does, however, include a breadth of the disciplines involved in digital humanities scholarship, it contains varying forms of media involved in defining digital humanities, and it is large enough for topic modeling to be useful, though it is on the small side of topic modeling corpora. One limitation of the corpus is that the texts we topic modeled were all in English, which might skew the overall corpus’ representation toward North American and English-speaking European scholarship. To clean the texts we removed special (non-UTF-8) characters, front matter, and headers and footers. We then topic modeled this 334-definition corpus using the R packagemalletby David Mimno<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mimno2013"> [mimno2013] </a>. We then prepared the topic modeling data for analysis in three ways. First, we produced word clouds representing the top 100 words associated with each topic with size representing the preponderance of each word. Second, we produced timeline graphs of the average presence of each topic through time (sum of all the topic presences for each year in a topic-document matrix divided by the number of documents in each year). Third, we mapped the location of the institutions of the first author of each document at the time the document was published. We color-coded the resulting dots to make heatmaps of each topic’s presence in space. Despite the attempt to look at the data in various ways, very few of the timelines and not one of the heatmaps showed discernible trends of topics through time or space. What ended up being more revealing was the metadata we collected about each author at the time of their piece’s publication: academic rank (or job title), department, institution, location, gender, media of publication (blog, article, etc.) and whether or not the piece was co-authored.</p>
<p>On one level, this project is a straightforward analysis of the results of our topic models and our metadata. We are interested in what types of things people talk about when they define digital humanities. Are there trends through time in how people define digital humanities? Are there detectable national or regional differences in topic distribution? Is there gender or academic rank disparity in who is writing definitions of the field? Most centrally, we wanted to know if a topic model of definitions combined with metadata about the authors of said definitions could tell us about the push and pull of digital humanities and its methods, especially as they are experienced across gender lines: is the push and pull of digital humanities detectable in the topics we produce? Are male and female authors represented proportionally in topics, or are there topics that are dominated by one gender?</p>
<p>On another level, this is an experiment in learning a quantitative method in digital humanities. Using only an introductory book, can a group of interested humanists run topic models that produce novel insights? What is all the fuss about topic modeling? Is it powerful? Fun? Dangerous? Misleading? Revealing? Or even predictable, merely confirming what we already know? This article serves as an analysis of our own admittance into the field. Writing as junior scholars just entering our disciplines, we feel both the push and pull of digital humanities intensely. We hope we can add to the discussion of the phenomenon by analyzing it from the other side of the disciplinary door from scholars like Underwood.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-digital-humanities-defined">How is digital humanities defined?</h2>
<p>While we ran models with a wide range of parameters on this corpus, we finally decided on a run with 55 topics. Briefly, topics are a group of words that tend to co-occur in the corpus, and working with them can feel uncomfortably arbitrary. However, after playing with the inputs for a while, 55 topics seemed to produce topics that were granular enough to be meaningful, but not so narrow as to be overlapping.</p>
<p>Some of the topics that emerged from this model run were what one might expect. Words about different kinds of tools tended to co-occur in certain entries. We had a “tool, tools, web, topic, mapping” topic that included papers discussing the implications of Web 2.0 and web tools in the digital research environment<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cohen2008"> [cohen2008] </a>, surveys of projects using digital tools<a class="footnote-ref" href="#paradise2015"> [paradise2015] </a>, and articles that claim to “focus on conceptual issues rather than particular tools or projects” but that nonetheless mention tool/s 72 times, for example<a class="footnote-ref" href="#robertson2016"> [robertson2016] </a>. Some other topics focused on digital humanities as coming out of humanities computing ( “computing, mccarty, question, experimental, software” ), discipline-specific history-department approaches ( “history, historian, historians, philosophy, narrative” ), and library roles in digital humanities ( “libraries, librarians, service, library, work” ). Others seemed to be words that co-occur when definitions explore digital humanities as it uses, relates to, or critiques social media ( “twitter, social, network, users, scholars” ) or digital humanities in the classroom ( “students, tools, teaching, college, pedagogy” ). These topics fit the kinds of definitions we expected to find.</p>
<p>While these topics help to generally outline and categorize the range of subjects people address when they define digital humanities, there were four topics that, taken together, seem to encapsulate the push and pull of entry into digital humanities. These topics engage with coding in the context of jobs, digital humanities as a community with shared values, distant reading, and diversity in digital humanities<br>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Given our interest in the gatekeeping around coding and technical skills more broadly, we were drawn to inspecting the topic that emerged with the top words: “job, field, scholars, students, degree, code, programming, software, technologists.” The documents that are most highly associated with this topic indeed all address code and coding, especially in relation to the question of jobs. So, what is the consensus? Does one have to code to be a digital humanist or at least to get a job? There is no answer as such within the top documents associated with this topic. Instead, these documents together form more of a discussion of coding itself. The most favorable endorsements of coding range from memoir-like recollections of personal experiences of learning to code<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ramsay2016"> [ramsay2016] </a>to advise on how and where to learn Ruby<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cordell2011"> [cordell2011] </a>. Others argue that coding is potentially the least interesting aspect of what digital humanities practitioners do and should be downplayed on the job market<a class="footnote-ref" href="#davidson2011"> [davidson2011] </a>or not required at all in job postings<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gailey2011"> [gailey2011] </a>. Others came at coding from the opposite angle, arguing that developers and technologists should be recognized not only for their coding but also for their intellectual contributions to projects<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ridge2013"> [ridge2013] </a>. This topic may look like it would be comprised of scholars arguing that digital humanities is about coding, or that one needs to code to get a job. However, there is a range of different views towards coding even among the documents which have a high probability of these words co-occurring. While coding may be an ongoing conversation in the field, there was no consensus that coding was a bar that had to be passed to enter the field. The articles associated with this topic usually brought up questions about coding and digital humanities rather than taking a hard stance about coding’s role in the field. In this case, what appeared at first to be an instance of gatekeeping was actually mostly a discussion about gatekeeping (from both directions) and how to overcome it.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>In opposition to gatekeeping around to coding, which we thought we might find in the documents associated with the coding topic but did not, another topic seemed to be “about” defining digital humanities as an inclusive community with shared values. If we expected coding to be the trap door in Underwood’s metaphor, the definition of a community with shared values might be the welcome mat that invites people in. A topic in our model was comprised of the co-occurring, positive words “values, community, open, collaboration, openness, ideas.” Documents with a high probability of these words co-occurring included Lisa Spiro’s call for creating a core values statement in a collaborative, open way where everyone can edit and contribute<a class="footnote-ref" href="#spiro2012"> [spiro2012] </a>as well as a follow up on Spiro’s initial call proposing no overarching final statement as an outcome but rather a perpetual place to gather ideas on values<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hawk2013"> [hawk2013] </a>. Other documents included Scheinfeldt’s definition of digital humanities as a “set of overlapping personal communities” with shared interests and shared values like open access and collaboration, among others<a class="footnote-ref" href="#scheinfeldt2010"> [scheinfeldt2010] </a>. This topic shows the largest spike in 2012, the year after Ramsay’s MLA 2011 “Who’s in Who’s out” talk (Figure 2), which, as we mentioned in the introduction to this article, galvanized a host of responses.</p>
<p>Overall, investigation of the documents most highly associated with this topic confirms our first impressions of the word cloud. When first faced with the “coding” cloud of words, however, it was evident that the words themselves failed to divulge the meaning which we eventually drew from them. The “coding” and “community” topics, taken together, comprise two ends of a spectrum of topic transparency and underscore the importance of going back to the documents themselves to inform the interpretation of any topic. We had read about the necessity of toggling scales and perspectives in reading<a class="footnote-ref" href="#koller2015"> [koller2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#janicke2015"> [janicke2015] </a>, but were surprised in how much topics varied in the distance between what they seemed to be “about” and what ideas the documents were actually addressing.</p>

<h2 id="distant-reading">Distant Reading</h2>
<p>Among the 334 definitions of digital humanities that we analyzed, there was a discernible “distant reading” topic. Words like: “literary, reading, text, texts, literature, Moretti, criticism, distant, patterns, close” comprised this topic. The texts most associated with this topic tend to mention Franco Moretti. They seem to either equate the digital humanities with text mining<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fish2012"> [fish2012] </a>or let text mining stand as a synecdoche for the whole field<a class="footnote-ref" href="#turan2016"> [turan2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#benzon2014b"> [benzon2014b] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#benzon2014a"> [benzon2014a] </a>. After all, literary analysis using text mining and distant reading is a major sub-field that sometimes seems to eclipse other forms of digital humanities. In response, Stephen Robertson has written about the disparate genealogy of digital history coming out of oral history, folk studies, and public histories in part to counter the predominant narrative of text analysis in humanities computing being <em>the</em> origin story of all of digital humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#robertson2014"> [robertson2014] </a>.</p>
<p>What is most striking about this topic, however, is not its robust presence in definitions of digital humanities, but the fact that the documents most highly associated with this topic are predominantly written by men (Figure 3). In fact, 19 of the top 20 documents associated with this topic are written by male first-authors.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> There is no other topic in our run of this topic model that so disproportionately features male authors.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> This might not come as a surprise since distant reading has been recognized as a field that has been unreceptive to women and which can replicate the most simple of stereotypes about women writers<a class="footnote-ref" href="#klein2018"> [klein2018] </a>. For example, in <em>Macroanalysis</em> , Matthew Jockers separates 19th-century novels by gender and looks at differences in topics addressed by male and female authors. He writes that “The gender data from this corpus are a ringing confirmation of virtually all of our stereotypes about gender. Smack at the top of the list of themes most indicative of female authorship is Female fashion. Fashion is followed by Children, Flowers, Sewing, and a series of themes associated with strong emotions” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#jockers2013"> [jockers2013] </a>. The decision to describe the gendered distributions of themes with the unfortunate word choice of “confirming” gender stereotypes rather than a more felicitous term like “reflecting” or “echoing” gender stereotypes of the era leaves Jockers open to critique. But an issue with distant reading that is far more pervasive and important than a captious quibble with phrasing is the tendency to note a gendered (or other socially and historically constructed complex category) trend and move on to the next significant result rather than to sit with the uncomfortable result and think critically about it. A difference in the themes picked up by male and female writers of the 19th century can be the impetus for a discussion of what types of activities were open to women in the first place and the ways that laws, the marketplace, and social norms might restrict themes available to women writers. More often than not, in texts like <em>Macroanalysis</em> , the difference in topics is merely noted without critical reflection before the discussion moves on to listing other interesting trends that were also detected. In observing a pattern but skipping further critical examination, the trends uncovered by distant reading methods can, unfortunately, buttress stereotypes that women love fashion, for example. These instances of noting trends without unpacking them can affect how welcoming a field is to other voices. Women entering a sub-field heavily reliant on math, statistics, and rationality, such as text mining, might not feel especially welcome if the field is producing descriptions of women writers as emotional, fashion-obsessed mothers.</p>
<p>In addition to the reiteration of stereotypes about women writers, Franco Moretti, the founding figure of distant reading, is one of the men publicly named as a result of the #metoo movement. While some have excavated the female-led genealogy of distant reading, offering an alternative to Moretti<a class="footnote-ref" href="#buurma2018"> [buurma2018] </a>, others, like Lauren Klein, have argued that this revelation about Moretti merely confirms the critiques that have been leveled against the practice of distant reading for years. Namely, that distant reading fails when it comes to dealing with gender conceptually, rhetorically, and in its models (as well as in the representation of women in the field)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#klein2018"> [klein2018] </a>.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>The final topic we examine in-depth ties together a constellation of essays that turn the lens of critique back on digital humanities itself. In the documents most highly associated with this topic, authors address diversity and inclusion in digital humanities. The topic’s top words are “race, project, projects, gender, women, feminist, transformdh, studies, color, black, koh, postcolonial, queer,” and the documents with the highest probability of this topic engage vigorously with the question of diversity and representation in digital humanities. These definitions directly address the lack of diversity in digital humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#barnett2014"> [barnett2014] </a>, propose taking a more proactive and transformative approach toward inviting diverse members in<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2012"> [bailey2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#lothian2013"> [lothian2013] </a>, advocate for recognizing the work that women and people of color have always already been doing in digital humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#perez2016"> [perez2016] </a>, describe the feelings of being a woman of color in DH spaces<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cong-huyen2013"> [cong-huyen2013] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#perez2016"> [perez2016] </a>, and survey projects that are at the cutting edge of examining race, privilege, and power and the digital humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cong-huyen2013"> [cong-huyen2013] </a>. Women made up the majority of the authors of these pieces (Figure 3) with thirteen of the top twenty documents associated with this topic being authored by women.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It may not be surprising that when defining digital humanities, women are leading in bringing up issues of diversity and inclusion. This demonstrates that one of the ways inclusiveness benefits a field is to introduce new areas of research and writing that otherwise may not have been present. In this capacity, it shows that one of the benefits that women have already brought to the field of digital humanities is a critical conversation around diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>The texts associated with this topic also pertain to the central theme of this article: the push and pull of the digital humanities, especially in regard to gender and race. This work is critically important in a field that embraces its reputation of niceness and inclusion while historically failing to foster the careers of diverse scholars. For example, the Digital Humanities 2011 conference theme of “Big Tent Digital Humanities” has been critiqued for simultaneously trumpeting the inclusiveness of the field while failing to recognize that the field might actually fail by many inclusivity metrics. Melissa Terras writes of DH 2011, “It is all very well saying that DH is open and welcoming and encourages participation – but despite open platforms such as DH answers, and the DIY approach, it is still a very rich, very western academic field with a limited number of job openings” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#terras2011"> [terras2011] </a>. The conference also featured four male plenary and prize speakers complemented by male chairs for each of these most prestigious events. The 2011 conference may have provoked an ongoing response from the digital humanities community (in addition to that of Terras), as this diversity and inclusion topic increased over time, detectable in the corpus from 2011 onward (Figure 4).</p>

<p>At this point, it bears thinking through what we have been doing so far in this article. Are our objectives and method more aligned with thedistant readingtopic or thediversity and inclusiontopic? Using topic modeling in this paper is most definitely a form of distant reading. Although we have a corpus in the hundreds, not thousands or millions, we are using a computer to put the corpus together and read it in aggregate in order to create new meaning. We also, of course, employ a similar method to the one we critiqued Matthew Jockers for in the previous section; we look at topics and examine the different ratios of male and female-authored papers associated with them. We even learned topic modeling in the first place from a different book by Jockers, the empowering <em>Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature</em> which expands the field by teaching those who may not have picked up coding viaextracurricularactivities how to use R to perform all sorts of analyses on texts. The difference is, at this moment, we are attempting to <em>use</em> distant reading to <em>critique</em> distant reading. While we may question whether we can critique something using its own tools, we also think that the discomfort in being both a distant reader and the object of distant reading is a productive one. As Nickoal Eichmann, Jeana Jorgensen, and Scott Weingart write in their study on diversity and inclusion in the annual digital humanities conference, “by turning our “macroscopes” on ourselves, we offer a critique of our culture, and hopefully inspire fruitful discomfort in DH practitioners who apply often-dehumanizing tools to their subjects, but have not themselves fallen under the same distant gaze” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#weingart2016"> [weingart2016] </a>. What we have found most productive in this exercise is exploring the discomfort of turning our gaze on our own work and writing into it. Instead of hiding the discomfort of dividing authors based on gender and looking for differences, or simply noting a gendered difference in topics and moving on, we discussed it, debated it, and ultimately wrote about it in this article (see footnote 2 for a summary of our debate).</p>
<h2 id="who-is-defining-digital-humanities">Who is defining digital humanities?</h2>
<p>As is evident from our explorations via topic modeling, we are not only interested in getting a general sense of <em>how</em> people define the digital humanities, but <em>who</em> is doing the defining. To that end, we collected data on the pieces and their authors. Did, for example, these definitions hold up to digital humanities’ reputation for being a collaborative endeavor? In what ways might those who are writing definitions be a homogeneous or diverse group?</p>
<p>It turns out that definitional pieces might be one of the types of digital humanities work that is most closely aligned with traditional academic writing, at least with respect to collaboration. Only 12.6 percent of the definitions in our corpus were co-authored. Department of author is another area that is not evenly distributed. While there are a wide variety of departments represented in the corpus, most definitions are written by authors with positions in English departments. English department definitions are nearly twice as numerous as the next most common department-of-origin: digital humanities departments/centers. Out of the people writing definitions from digital humanities centers, half of those have PhDs in English. Library and Information Sciences authors follow, then definitions from History departments. Next-most-numerous are definitions written by people who have no departmental affiliation: journalists, independent scholars, deans, software engineers, etc. (Figure 5).</p>

</figure>
<p>Even though about half of humanities PhDs go to women<a class="footnote-ref" href="#genderdistribution"> [genderdistribution] </a>men wrote about 63 percent of the definitions in our corpus. Even more surprising is the way the male-female percentages break down by job title within academia (Figure 6). Male authors are overrepresented in the more senior academic positions. There are about four times as many definitional pieces written by male full professors than female full professors. Similarly, there are about twice as many definitions written by male Associate Professors, Assistant Professors, and Directors than female. On the other hand, in the pool of definitions written by junior academics, female authors outnumber male. There are more definitions written by female graduate students, postdocs, visiting scholars, and librarians than male. Overall, male full professors are the most prolific definers of the field, suggesting that while definitions are diverse in terms of academic position, they could be more equitable in their distribution among voices.</p>

<p>In our analysis of the Terras/Nyhan/Vanhoutte bibliography, we only included short-form definitions (no full-length books). In our corpus of 334 definitions, over 200 were blog posts, followed distantly by 60+ academic journal articles. While there are some manifestos, popular articles, journal editorials, and book chapters, it seems that much work in defining digital humanities goes on in the gray literature of blog post, conference papers, and other informal communication. Interestingly, the more informal publication mode of blog posts, was just as uneven in terms of gender distribution of authors as the more formal peer-reviewed academic journal articles. There were 61 women and 138 men authoring blog posts in the corpus, while 17 women and 39 men were first authors in academic journal articles (in both cases, about 30% of the pieces had women as their first or only author).</p>
<p>This connects with Tara Thomson’s warning that informal and nontraditional formats do not necessarily equate with egalitarianism. Her narrative of her experience at an unconference shows that those with less disciplinary knowledge may feel more exposed and that informal events tend to get led by those with more professional confidence<a class="footnote-ref" href="#thomson2015"> [thomson2015] </a>. Those that published definitions on the digital humanities on their blogs felt entitled to take a stab at defining the field on their own, without the feedback of peer review. Blogs might not be more egalitarian a means of publishing digital humanities definitions, at least in terms of gender.</p>
<p>Finally, our corpus was extremely homogeneous in terms of geographic location of the institution from which the authors were writing. Only three of the authors in the entire corpus came from cities outside of Europe, the United States, or Canada. Our corpus featured a definition by a scholar writing from The Centre for Internet and Society in Delhi, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in Mexico City, and American University of Beirut in Beirut. As mentioned earlier, this lack of diversity in geographical origin of these definitions may partially stem from the fact that our corpus was entirely in English, but it also speaks to Melissa Terras’ earlier critique that self-praise for inclusivity misses the fact digital humanities remains a “very rich, very western academic field” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#terras2011"> [terras2011] </a>. Apart from the observation that nearly all the definitions were from the United States, Canada, and European nations, regional data did not lead to novel insights. While we analyzed topics by region of origin, no topic showed a preponderance of authors from a single nation or continent. We were expecting to find regional “flavors” of digital humanities, perhaps North American and European DH, respectively reflecting speculative vs. scientific modes of digital humanities, but mostly topics featured a mix of authors from North American and European institutions. If styles of DH vary by geographical region, our topic model was not a good instrument to detect this.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Defining digital humanities is an activity that shows no signs of slowing down. While proliferating definitions can be a good offset to gate-keeping, they can also lead to a sense of whiplash for those interested in entering the field. For our group of early-career academic co-authors, we experienced both excitement and worry at the prospect of using topic modeling to read a corpus of digital humanities definitions. We were excited to learn the technique of topic modeling, but the lack of consensus on how to use and interpret topics left us in a liminal space: we had successfully coded, and yet we had no idea if our efforts yielded meaningful results. It took interpretive work and insider DH knowledge to describe any topic’s connection to the field. To us, the act of interpreting topics mirrored the push and pull that we see within the field, indicating that perhaps less emphasis should be placed on digital competencies and more emphasis on the step of interpretation that comes after the use of a digital tool. If established scholars not only provided manuals on how to use digital tools but also explained how they interpreted their results as meaningful, that would be an immensely useful step.</p>
<p>The topic model itself proved the least interesting and least difficult aspect of our work. Though the topic model indicated multiple routes that people tend to take when defining digital humanities, the really interesting stories emerged when we combined the topic model outputs with our painstakingly-gathered metadata or after hours of focused reading of the individual documents in the corpus. The model’s breadth of topics did confirm our initial feeling of disorientation — not knowing if we were being welcomed or warned away from topic modeling and digital humanities in general. With definitions that ranged from advice on learning to code to documents that defined the field according to utopian values like “openness,” the topic model did represent quite a range of ways the field is defined and encapsulated topics that covered both the push and the pull of digital humanities. While some define the field in relation to the subset of work that uses distant reading and text mining, others define the field as a community of people who self-identify as members based on shared values. Still others challenge the field to become more diverse even as they define it. Although temporal and spatial analyses of our 55 topics showed few interpretable trends in definitions across time and none across space, our analysis did produce some novel insights. We detected possible gender trends in the “distant reading” and “diversity” topics, indicating the push and pull of digital humanities may be felt disproportionately across gender differences, especially when it comes to particular methods or perspectives on what constitutes DH. In addition, the overall corpus of definitions contained gender and class imbalance, especially in the number of definitions written by tenured men. These insights are important to a field invested in inclusivity, yet grappling with a long history of failing on this front. If definitions of digital humanities are one of the genres that interested parties first encounter when beginning to research the field, then advancing definitions that both include and foster diverse perspectives is of critical importance. Knowing in which types of definitions women’s voices are most underrepresented (and conversely, most robustly present) can help the field address problem areas.</p>
<p>In terms of technical competencies “required” for entry into DH versus opening up the field to individuals with a wide variety of experience-levels, it was refreshing that the most useful part of this study for ourselves was not the model itself, with its requisite R proficiency, but the part that one could do with a simple spreadsheet and google charts. What produced the most compelling insights was not the technical wizardry of Latent Dirichlet allocation but our communal spreadsheet. We considered producing the demographic graphs in this article in R as a signal of disciplinary belonging but ultimately decided that the fact that the most interesting figures were made not with a statistical programming language, but with built-in spreadsheet capabilities was an important aspect of what we wanted to say in this paper. As an exercise in learning a much-talked-about digital humanities technique as a foray into the field, we concluded that perhaps both the promise of the power of topic modeling and its dangers might have loomed larger in our imagination than in reality. The push and the pull of digital humanities can feel strong to early scholars interested in the field, but once you dive in, you might realize the waters are both less clear and less perilous than they seem from the shore.</p>

<p>It is important to remember here that the topics and topic distributions spit out by a topic model are not stable entities that exist as concrete reality. These top twenty documents are not a final tally of the people who define digital humanities using distant reading. When choosing a different number of topics for the model, there might still be a recognizable “distant reading” topic, but the probability that each document features that topic will be different. So, for example, when running our topic model with 70 topics, we found there was still indeed a topic that was recognizable as similarly “about” distant reading, but the top twenty documents associated with this “distant reading” topic featured 17 texts written by men and 3 texts written by women. There’s a danger in taking topics and the documents associated with them too much as reflections of reality, and, though any “distant reading” topic produced <em>may</em> be dominated by male authors, we are far from having shown that.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>We discussed, debated, and deliberated on how and whether to incorporate gender into our metadata. Most of the metadata we compiled was a snapshot at the time of publication of the particular piece. So while someone may be a distinguished professor now, if, at the time of their definition, they were a graduate student, then we recorded “graduate student” as their occupation. Gender is fluid too, in motion and on a spectrum, so we considered recognizing that gender identity can change by recording gender at the time of publication. But, while we wanted to recognize that gender is fluid, we wanted to avoid dead-gendering people. Also, we discussed how we could ethically determine someone else’s gender identity. Especially if the identity changed later, who is to say it hadn’t already changed in most circumstances at the time of publication? We decided to determine gender based on people’s own, current websites. Most of the time we were lucky in that the professional websites people would create for themselves, in their own voice, had bio-blurbs written in the third person. From this, we could get the author’s preferred pronouns, and use those as a key to gender identity. But when this was not available we did base our gender determination on names, which relies on stereotypes of what is a “male” vs. a “female” name, and inevitably led to some mistakes. We also debated not including gender at all at the risk of presuming someone’s gender identity or forcefully assigning gender to people. But on the other hand, our interest in definitions of digital humanities sprung from the disorienting push and pull we felt from the field, and a key point of that argument is that when bars are set for entry, they are felt especially by women. Ultimately, we feel it was important to include gender precisely for the results presented here: that more men mention distant reading when defining digital humanities than women. So despite our own discomfort, we have included a consideration of author gender when discussing these pieces.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>When we ran the topic model with 70 topics, we also looked at a topic similar to this one. The top twenty documents associated with the analogous topic of the 70 topic run had the same gender distribution: 13 female-authored and 7 male-authored pieces, but keep in mind the warning of the previous footnote — that topics are not stable entities that reflect the “reality” of the corpus, but are rather a heuristic which which to think.## Bibliography&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
