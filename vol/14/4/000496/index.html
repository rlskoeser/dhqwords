These developments provide alternatives and additions to familiar analytical approaches and give new weight to the kinds of statistical and numerical data collection that have been established with analogue means <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. New software-based methods have led to a whole range of research that aims at producing machine-readable data as well as processing this data within the logics of quantitative analysis, advanced statistics or visualization. With regard to audio-visual material, Cinemetrics <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>, the Digital Formalism project (e.g. <a href=#gruber2009>Gruber et al. 2009</a>) and especially Adelheid Heftberger <sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> as well as the film color projects conceived and led by Barbara Flückiger (e.g. <a href=#fluckiger2017>Flückiger 2017</a>), among others, have made groundbreaking contributions to this line of research.</p><p>At the same time, new possibilities for harvesting archives and metadata sets have propelled advances in historical research (e.g. <a href=#jacobs2016>Jacobs and Fyfe 2016</a>, <a href=#verhoeven2016>Verhoeven 2016</a>). Large parts of the latter development have been described and theorized convincingly under the term “distant reading” (see <a href=#moretti2013>Moretti 2013</a>). The methodology of distant reading has opened up new perspectives for research within the humanities, namely a shift from exemplary analysis to the comparative study of large corpora, while at the same time generating new modes of evidentness. For example, there are numerous approaches combining quantitative empiricism and humanities&rsquo; epistemology <sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> or producing new aesthetic modes of insight by means of big data visualization (e.g., the Cultural Analytics research by Manovich’s Software Studies Initiative <sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>) and other activities situated in the field of artistic and explorative research <sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup>.</p><p>There are many possible research objectives that all share the feasibility of studying large corpora as a key requirement: for example the analysis of a very productive novelist’s body of work or the comparative study of all news reports on a given topic within a certain country and time frame. In particular the compilation of large sets of art works and media by means of social sciences and neuropsychology benefits from these kinds of insights from the humanities, may they be quantitative or – as we will try to demonstrate – qualitative. Therefore, the possibility of studying large corpora, which has been considered out of reach for single scholars or small groups of researchers who work within the framework of close and detailed hermeneutical studies, promises new perspectives for research within the humanities as well as interdisciplinary research.</p><p>But while opening up these perspectives, the methodology of distant reading – especially the turn to quantitative methods and often highly abstracting visualizations – has also created a major challenge with regard to advancing on this path in the field of art and media studies. These epistemological principles aim at expanding humanities&rsquo; focus to larger corpora by an emphasis on the distant purposely transforming or even discarding the reading. It thus literally distances respective research in the field of the digital humanities from what we assume to be at the core of art and media consumption in the first place: the human experience of a given work of art or media. In this sense, “Distant reading is almost not reading at all” <sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup>.<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup> This mostly concerns studies of extensive corpora that by and large still focus on a combination of quantitative approaches and the epistemology of distant reading <sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup>. As a result, the methodology of distant reading has generated whole new sets of research questions and perspectives with regard to the macro structures and long term developments of certain media, formats and genres – but the underlying principles of abstraction<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup> , accumulation and statistics fall short when it comes to questions of performativity, dynamics of perception, or aesthetic experience.</p><p>This circumstance becomes apparent in the field of performative, time-based arts like music, theatre, dance or film – especially if the respective research is shaped by a theoretical framework that draws on phenomenological approaches to aesthetics and poetics. In these cases, statistical data based on discrete entities is often of limited value. It is well possible to count how many A-minor chords are featured in a given piece of music, how often a dancer performs a certain move, or which percentage of long shots are followed by a close-up in a film. But from a certain perspective within the study of performative arts, this information is epistemologically incomplete. With regard to aesthetic experience, it is only the specific tangible context – the harmonics and dynamics of that specific piece of music, the kinaesthetics of bodily expression in that certain dance routine or the interplay of music, cutting rhythm and acting within that particular film scene – which makes these features meaningful. The very advantage of distant reading – stepping out of the tangible context of a certain point in time or space within a given work of art in order to get a grasp on overarching principles of the work as a whole (or even larger corpora) – shows its limits. Whereas a research object that is being referred to in terms of a semiotic, semantic, or syntactic paradigm can be divided into discrete entities with a fixed ‘value‘ or ‘meaning‘, the experiential quality of a certain detail within a phenomenological approach to aesthetics and performativity largely depends on the aesthetic composition as a whole. Accordingly, these research objects pose a challenge to the ways the isolation of features, the encoding of media texts and the accumulation of data are currently being conducted within parts of the methodologies of digital humanities.</p><p>Against this backdrop, this paper addresses a simple question: Is it possible to use tools and methods developed within the fields of computational science and digital humanities in order to carry out qualitative analysis of aesthetic compositions? How can we productively study aesthetic experience while drawing upon the informational paradigm <sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup>, i.e. the data driven operations of computational analysis?</p><p>In the following, we will present the methodological developments of the interdisciplinary project “Audio-visual rhetorics of affect” <sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup> (a cooperation of film studies and computational science; from here on referred to by its short title “AdA-project” ) as an exemplary approach to the computational analysis of performative arts and media. Drawing on a qualitative approach to dynamics of affect in audio-visual media <sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup> that combines a phenomenological understanding of film with the structural analysis of compositional patterns, this project aims at identifying rhetorical tropes within feature films, documentaries and TV reports on the global financial crisis (2007 and following). Addressing the questions posed above, this paper will focus less on specific findings (i.e. certain rhetorical tropes or a set thereof) but rather on the analytical framework that has been established in order to study a large corpus of audio-visual material with regard to aesthetic experience. This framework draws upon tools from the computational sciences, i.e. (semi-)automatic video analysis, semantic data structuring and machine learning.<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup></p><p>On the one hand, the AdA-project has to grasp its subject matter on the micro-level of audiovisual composition – due to the focus on audio-visual rhetorics and the dynamics of affect shaped by moving images. On the other hand, this micro-level has to become graspable within an epistemological framework similar to the approach of distant reading in order to identify recurring compositional patterns.</p><p>This path poses two obstacles: a) the micro-level description of compositional structures has to be carried out across a corpus of films and TV reports that is well beyond the scope of what film scholars are able to analyze by themselves within the timeline of a research project; b) an approach including the scalable analysis of aesthetics and expressivity has to generate paths towards modes of abstraction that are fundamentally different to what semiotic and statistical paradigms of distant reading currently have to offer, as well as to humanities analysis approaches based solely on natural language. Against this backdrop, this paper intends to treat the AdA-project’s methodology as an example for studying performative arts and media by means of computational analysis. By discussing the specific challenges the project has to address, the paper seeks to sketch out ways towards modes of analytical abstraction and data processing that remain close to the way artworks and media are experienced by human beings. It thus contributes to the more recent trend to integrate the close, the distant and the in-between under the terms of “scalable reading” or “scalable viewing” <sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup>.</p><p>In order to exemplify the path the project has taken so far with regard to the aforementioned obstacles, this paper will present a method from the field of film studies that – aiming at the affective experience of audio-visual sequences – qualifies their affective dimension by means of qualitative description and conceptually grasps the nexus of aesthetic experience of viewers and rhythmic-kinetic figurations of audiovisual images (see Sections 1.2 and 1.3). We will then proceed to address a number of challenges we encountered on our way of remodeling this method within a computational framework; this includes a detailed video-annotation routine, semantic data structures, the integration of tools that enable semi-automatic video analysis as well as computer-generated visualizations of compositional patterns. Therefore, the main focus of this article is on the recasting of the common knowledge of basic film analytical concepts into a consistent, machine-readable data model which provides the basis to address many challenges of digital film analytical methods (see Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3). Finally, we will present how the analysis of the same example mentioned above unfolds if it is performed within the methodological framework of our computer-based approach (see Section 2.4) – and reflect upon the perspectives this kind of research offers with regard to matching computational analysis and human experience in the field of art and media studies (see Section 3).</p><h2 id=1-a-systematic-approach-to-human-experience-the-emaex-method-and-affective-dynamics-in-film-viewing>1. A systematic approach to human experience: The eMAEX-Method and affective dynamics in film-viewing</h2><p>Before we discuss this paper’s main question – how to analyze arts and media on the level of human experience within a digital humanities framework – it is important to address a crucial question on the level of film theory first: Is it after all possible to address aesthetic experience on a general level, regardless of individual dispositions and differences and without postulating universal mechanisms of perceiving and processing? This question concerns any kind of research dealing with human experience of temporal arts and media, not turning to methods of self-disclosure or physiological measurements of actual empirical subjects (e.g. as applied within the social sciences and empirical psychology). In order to address it – in an exemplary way –, we are going to briefly sketch out a qualitative method developed within the field of film studies that aims at qualifying the affective experience of audio-visual segments based on film-analytical methods (see <a href=#kappelhoff2011>Kappelhoff and Bakels 2011</a>, <a href=#kappelhoff2018a>Kappelhoff 2018a</a>, <a href=#scherer2014>Scherer et al. 2014</a>).</p><h2 id=11-aesthetic-experience-and-intersubjectivity-in-film-viewing--theoretical-bases>1.1 Aesthetic experience and intersubjectivity in film viewing – theoretical bases</h2><p>As the programmatic remarks have indicated so far, we are strongly advocating for an approach to digital humanities that accentuates the theory driven and theory building aspect of humanities’ research. The following chapter serves as a brief sketch of the film theoretical background that informs both our research questions and the direction of method and tool development in the collaboration with our colleagues from the computational sciences. Even though we hope that key elements of the approach – specifically the systematic annotation vocabulary and the data visualization – are employable by different theoretical schools, they have been developed in view of a framework that focuses on the premises of embodied perception and the expressivity of movement patterns.</p><p>From a film studies perspective, all methodological questions concerning film analysis in the context of digital humanities are preceded by the challenge to engage descriptively with a fleeting subject matter that solely exists within the time of its perception <sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup>, and more pinpointed to our theoretical perspective: its being-viewed by an embodied spectator. Some branches of film theory tend to avoid this problem by tying the spectator’s emotions in film viewing to the cognitive apprehension of character and plot constellations <sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:27><a href=#fn:27 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>27</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:28><a href=#fn:28 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>28</a></sup>, largely leaving aside the media specific conditions of moving images and sound. While these theories have attracted a certain attention in the wake of a broader turn towards cognitive theory and neuropsychology over the past two decades, they remain in opposition to a theoretical strand that has been prominent within film studies since Hugo Münsterberg’s early psychological accounts on the “photoplay” <sup id=fnref:29><a href=#fn:29 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>29</a></sup>. This line of research focuses on the dynamics of movement and rhythm as the central phenomena with regard to the aesthetic experience of moving images, especially with regard to questions of mood, feeling, affect or emotion. Within the early years of the 20th century, the concept of expressive movement began to serve as a crucial node at the intersection of art theory <sup id=fnref:30><a href=#fn:30 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>30</a></sup>, social philosophy <sup id=fnref:31><a href=#fn:31 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>31</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:32><a href=#fn:32 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>32</a></sup> and anthropology <sup id=fnref:33><a href=#fn:33 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>33</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:34><a href=#fn:34 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>34</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:35><a href=#fn:35 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>35</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:36><a href=#fn:36 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>36</a></sup>. While these theories referred to the concept mainly with regard to the human body’s expressivity and its role in art and culture, Münsterberg and his successors in film theory – like Béla Balázs <sup id=fnref:37><a href=#fn:37 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>37</a></sup> or Sergej Eisenstein <sup id=fnref:38><a href=#fn:38 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>38</a></sup> – applied it to the kinetic and rhythmic patterns of the cinematic image.</p><p>In this tradition of thought, theories on movement and its expressive qualities have gained new attention following the bodily turn respectively performative turn within the humanities and social sciences that took place in the 1990s. In film theory, neo-phenomenological theories on embodiment and embodied perception once again turned the focus on movement and its crucial role at the intersection of expressivity and embodied perception (see <a href=#marks2000>Marks 2000</a>, <a href=#barker2009>Barker 2009</a>, <a href=#meunier2019>Meunier 2019</a>). Following Vivian Sobchack <sup id=fnref:39><a href=#fn:39 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>39</a></sup>, one of the most prominent voices within neo-phenomenological film theory, it is exactly this expressive quality of movement that provides the basis for an intersubjective understanding of experience in film viewing. According to Sobchack, the cinematic image presents itself as a situated seeing and hearing, a subjective perspective. In the act of film viewing, the spectator experiences the kinetic and haptic qualities of this situated viewing and hearing as an embodied being. The spectator’s perception and the cinematic image – as an expression of perception, of seeing and hearing – are intertwined in a two-fold act of perception grounded in the principle of an embodied being’s kinetic being-in-the-world:</p><blockquote><p>In a search for rules and principles governing cinematic expression, most of the descriptions and reflections of classical and contemporary film theory have not fully addressed the cinema as life expressing life, as experience expressing experience. Nor have they explored the mutual possession of this experience of perception and its expression by filmmaker, film, and spectator – all viewers viewing, engaged as participants in dynamically and directionally reversible acts that reflexively and reflectively constitute the perception of expression and the expression of perception. Indeed, it is this mutual capacity for and possession of experience through common structures of embodied existence, through similar modes of being-in-the-world, that provide the intersubjective basis of objective cinematic communication.<br><sup id=fnref1:39><a href=#fn:39 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>39</a></sup> Sobchack’s notion of the intersubjectivity of kinetic and haptic dynamics of film resonates with thoughts on the commonalities of film and music Sergej Eisenstein has developed in the 1940s, suggesting specific compositional principles with regard to the arrangement of movement and rhythm while outlining his ideas of expressive movement and a cinematic aesthetics of effect <sup id=fnref:40><a href=#fn:40 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>40</a></sup>. Lately, these ideas on cinema’s audio-visual musicality have again been picked up on in theories on audience engagement <sup id=fnref:41><a href=#fn:41 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>41</a></sup> as well as with regard to dynamic affects in film-viewing <sup id=fnref:42><a href=#fn:42 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>42</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:43><a href=#fn:43 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>43</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:44><a href=#fn:44 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>44</a></sup>.</p></blockquote><p>This conception of the audio-visual modulation of affects grounded in the temporal shaping of intensities and rhythms has also been argued for by appealing to the work of the developmental psychologist Daniel Stern <sup id=fnref:45><a href=#fn:45 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>45</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:46><a href=#fn:46 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>46</a></sup>. His theory of the vitality affects or vitality forms was introduced to the film theoretical discourse by Raymond Bellour <sup id=fnref:47><a href=#fn:47 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>47</a></sup>. Affects here are applied as self-contained temporal gestalts of movement, of rhythm, and of intensity, which are not linked to individual modalities of perception or forms of interaction. It is a matter of synaesthetic patterns, such as the creeping, the bulging, the explosion-like, or the fading, which can each occur as specific experiences, both in perception and in action as well as in feeling and thinking. These are derived from primordial forms of intersubjective, cross-modal interaction, like the affective reflection of an infant’s facial expression in the voice of its mother. Cinema, according to Bellour, can also be thought of as a similar interaction, constantly translating perceptions into feelings, for it produces:</p><blockquote><p>in the variety of its components (the image and the modalities of the soundtrack incorporated in it) [&mldr;] the constant illusion of a sensory attunement between the elements of the world, just as it does between the bodies that are deployed in it.<br><sup id=fnref1:47><a href=#fn:47 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>47</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Taken together, neo-phenomenological film theory’s core assumption of the audio-visual image being intersubjectively experienced as a two-fold act of kinaesthetic perception on the one hand, and theories on expressive movement, rhythm and audio-visual composition on the other, offer a way to address the aesthetic experience of moving images from an analytical perspective. Theories on movement and rhythm in audio-visual images serve as a methodological starting point for reconstructing dynamics of swelling tensions, shifting kinetic forces and the temporal shapes that emerge within these dynamics – by means of systematically describing patterns of audio-visual composition and their experiential qualities. In turn, neo-phenomenological theories on the embodied perception of movement provide the theoretical basis for assuming these experiential qualities to be experienced regardless of individual dispositions and differences, i.e. addressing human experience on a more general level without claiming universality.</p><p>With regard to the question raised at the beginning of this section – whether it is at all possible to address aesthetic experiences in film viewing on a general level via means of film analysis – we can now give a more nuanced answer: Of course, we do not claim to be able to predict a specific human being’s experience of a certain audio-visual sequence in detail and in total by means of film analysis. Obviously, we would never deny the notion of experience being rooted in specific cultural and historical contexts, as well as the conception that matters of feeling and understanding are highly subjective. Against the theoretical background we have sketched out here <sup id=fnref1:43><a href=#fn:43 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>43</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:48><a href=#fn:48 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>48</a></sup>, we should be able to demonstrate to what extent embodied experiences of audio-visual sequences can be reconstructed – by referring analytically to the spatial and temporal dynamics of specific rhythmic-kinetic figurations of audio-visual composition. Or to put it differently: We all do make our own experience in watching a certain film, TV series or news report. But given the basic principles of rhythm, movement and embodied perception, these individual experiences should relate to commonly shared experiential dynamics that are reflected in one way or another within our individual accounts. The aim of the method outlined within the rest of this article is to grasp this commonly shared basis of film experience and to make it accessible for comparative research. But before we get to the question of how this goal is achieved via digital tools, we first like to present a methodology that was developed with regard to this theoretical framework and exemplify it with a short analysis.</p><h2 id=12-emaex-qualifying-the-affective-dynamics-of-audio-visual-sequences-by-means-of-segmentation-and-description>1.2 eMAEX: qualifying the affective dynamics of audio-visual sequences by means of segmentation and description</h2><p>The eMAEX <sup id=fnref:49><a href=#fn:49 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>49</a></sup> system aims at providing a methodological framework for analyzing and qualifying the expressive and affective qualities of audio-visual material – may it be a contemporary Hollywood feature film, arthouse cinema, a screwball comedy, a war documentary or a web video.<sup id=fnref:50><a href=#fn:50 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>50</a></sup> At the time of its initial development, it consisted of a systematic routine to segment, describe and qualify units of audio-visual composition as well as a web-based multimedia environment that enables researchers to combine analytical descriptions, film stills, data visualizations and the subject matter of analysis (i.e. video files of audio-visual source material) in order to display the results of film analytical studies. The computational approach to film analysis presented in Section 2 of this article is based on the analytical routine of the eMAEX framework and can be viewed as an advancement and adaptation of its routine in regard to the requirements of a semantically structured and machine-readable analytical vocabulary. Over the course of the following two subchapters of this section, we will exemplify the original eMAEX approach in order to a) unfold a vivid example of what we mean when referring to the aesthetic experience of moving images from a film studies perspective and b) thereby provide the necessary background for addressing this paper’s central question: how a systematised and machine-readable analytical vocabulary in combination with digital tools for video annotation can help to expand such a perspective on embodied aesthetic experience with regard to the comparative analysis of large corpora.</p><p>Following the theoretical concepts of expressive movement and embodiment outlined above, eMAEX aims at the systematical description of spatio-temporal dynamics in moving images. Segmenting the subject matter at hand serves as the first step within the analytical routine and provides the basic temporal structure of the given subject matter. Following the intuitive elementary category of temporal segmentation within the everyday, journalistic and academic discourse, the object of study is first segmented into single scenes – conceptualized as an experiential unit.<sup id=fnref:51><a href=#fn:51 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>51</a></sup> Within the routine’s vocabulary, this basic structure, the succession and affective interplay of scenes, is referred to as the object of research’s temporal macro level.</p><p>While the segmentation into scenes is a methodological consensus in various film analytical approaches and often carried out intuitively, the second level of segmentation is intimately tied to the qualitative description of the analyzed material: Within the first step of analysis, an initial short description of the scene is produced; by focusing on five formal levels of audio-visual composition (namely choreography, camera, sound, gestures and facial expressions and image composition) rather than on narration and representation, this initial description provides a first insight into the compositional principles that shape the respective scene. The grouping of the many different aspects of audio-visual composition into these five levels was based on a pragmatic reasoning that balanced the need for some kind of standardization within projects with the limited possibilities of free text annotation. The elaboration of this standardization of description routines into a workable data modelling has been one of the main foci of our subsequent developments.</p><p>Based on this initial description, the scene as a whole is sub-segmented into consecutive expressive movement units (EMUs), i.e. the interplay of different levels of staging is described as one temporal gestalt, loosely comparable to a gesture of the film itself. Two of the five formal levels of composition mentioned above are chosen as dominant levels within each EMU. Usually changes with regard to dominant levels of composition provide strong hints with regard to the scene’s segmentation into EMUs. Following this second step of segmentation, a qualitative description of the compositional dynamics shaping each EMU is produced separately, and the respective EMU is qualified with regard to its affective dynamics.</p><p>In a final, third step, the dynamic interplay of a scene’s EMUs forming the compositional logic of the respective scene as a whole is also subject to a qualitative description of its affective dynamics. Following this last step, qualitative data on the respective subject matter of analysis has been gathered on three levels:<br>All scene’s sub-segments of audio-visual composition (EMUs) are qualified with regard to their affective dynamics as cross-modal temporal gestalts. This in-depth analysis constitutes the micro-level of analysis. The interplay of these sub-segments within each scene is also qualified with regard to its affective dynamics; this is referred to as the meso-level of analysis. The qualifications with regard to each scene’s affective dynamics are displayed as an affective course spanning the whole film; this course is referred to as the macro-level of analysis, revealing each research object’s basic dramaturgy of affect.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

The film <em>The Company Men</em> (John Wells, USA 2010) addresses the consequences of the financial crisis after 2007 in everyday life. More precisely, the film focuses on job cuts due to speculations on the stock market – by following several male protagonists and their struggle to find a new job in order to provide for their families.<sup id=fnref:52><a href=#fn:52 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>52</a></sup></p><p>To give you a short overview of the exemplary scene, taken from the second half of the film: Bobby Walker – played by Ben Affleck –, who has been fired from his office job at a logistics company in Boston and lives with his family at his parent’s house, is searching urgently for a job as marketeer. After getting a phone call with the invitation to a job interview and a short discussion with his wife, we see him preparing in a dark hotel room for the job interview with a company in Chicago: the protagonist awakes at dawn, carries out his fitness routine and irons his shirt. We then see him walking amid a crowd of people in business outfits towards a high corporate building. Inside the building, in a shiny lobby, Bobby walks towards the reception counter. After announcing himself he sits down and waits nervously. When the assistant of the awaited manager appears, Bobby learns that the appointment has been mixed up and that there won’t be a job interview. The scene ends with Bobby standing disappointed in a busy crowd of passersby on the streets of Chicago.</p><p>In this plot summary – like in every film synopsis – the varying experiential qualities and dynamics of the scene have already been synthesized into attributions like shiny, nervously, disappointed and so on. The following analysis is aimed at grasping the expressive qualities in which those summaries – i.e. verbal accounts of experience – are rooted. In order to make substantiated claims about the scene’s experiential quality, we will now break down the scene’s compositional structure into EMUs, drawing on the second level of temporal segmentation of the eMAEX framework as outlined above. In doing so, we will briefly describe each EMU and its affective quality with regard to the temporal gestalt that is constituted through the interplay of its dominant formal levels – in this case acoustics (especially music), image composition and camera.</p><h2 id=first-expressive-movement-unit-tc-011141011236>First Expressive Movement Unit (TC: 01:11:41–01:12:36)</h2><p>In the first EMU, a figuration of a sudden increase of vividness is created through the interplay of acting and acoustics, more specifically through harsh contrasts in the acting style – especially the bodily and facial expressivity of the main character played by Ben Affleck. At the beginning of the EMU, the fatigued protagonist walks up a driveway and enters his parents&rsquo; home’s kitchen. Laconic and with low body tension, he interacts with his family. When he’s told that there was a call in his absence from a firm in Chicago offering him a job, the film immediately cuts to the protagonist packing his suitcase while discussing the job offer with his wife. His body tension rises and his gestures become more and more energetic and extensive as he talks animatedly to his wife. The intensity of the protagonist&rsquo;s movements are highlighted by the restraint of his counterpart: His wife leans on the side of the image, half in the dark with arms crossed and a smile, she only interrupts him with brief questions or affirming comments. The increasing vitality in acting ground the experience of an abruptly emerging and then continually rising energy.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

This process is staged as a swelling movement figuration: The music becomes louder and more upbeat and the image increasingly brightens. In the last part, the camera movements, Bobby’s movement as well as those of passersby form a concerted choreography – an opening movement i.e. a cinematic gesture of widening. This choreography emphasizes the vertical axis and underlines the directedness of the whole sequence – from the hotel room to the busy streets of Chicago finally tilting up the tall corporate building. The interplay of music, movement and image composition form a swelling movement figuration that grounds an experience of vivid directedness.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

An assistant enters the image through a flight of stairs in the rear of the image and tells Bobby that his appointment will not take place. The lobby that the protagonist enters is staged as a space of suppressed vividness. This is achieved through the contrast of subtle, but constant movement of the isolated protagonists on the one hand and an image space dominated by geometric, rectangular shapes and clear lines and surfaces on the other. The camera approaches the conversation before cutting out abruptly to a medium long shot while the actors nearly freeze completely in their body movements and the dialogue stops. In this way, the interplay of acting, choreography and image composition grounds the experience of a vividness that is abruptly put to rest.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

A stretched piano-and-strings arrangement sets in. The camera focuses on the protagonist, positioning him at the center of the image. His body’s immobility is in harsh contrast to the many moving passersby that crowd the image in the fore- and background. Over two shots the camera moves towards the protagonist – thus narrowing the image space continually – and singles out his face that has lost its tension staring into the offscreen space. The contrast in movement exposes the protagonist and the swelling elegiac music emphasizes his facial expression. Together these articulatory strategies form a figuration of an intensifying deceleration and contraction that grounds an experience of slowly being isolated.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

Over the course of the whole scene, this affective course grounds an emerging image of disappointment.</p><p>After the initial sudden increase of vividness (the first EMU), a directed, swelling figuration (the second EMU) is abruptly put to rest (the third EMU). A figuration of intensifying deceleration and contraction (the fourth EMU) then closes the scene.</p><p>It is crucial that we are explicitly not talking about the emotions that the protagonist may feel, as if he was a person of flesh and blood – instead of being a mere composition of shapes, colors and sounds. Rather we claim that, in this scene, the unfolding of various audio-visual rhythms in the act of film-viewing <sup id=fnref2:43><a href=#fn:43 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>43</a></sup> – i.e. the entanglement of technically animated movement images and embodied experiences – can be qualified and reconstructed as an image of disappointment; the affective course laid out over the description of the scene’s four EMUs lends this image of disappointment its temporal and energetic shape – the abrupt rise of energy that comes with the increase of vividness; the directedness this joyful expectation can generate; the abrupt putting-to-rest that comes with disappointment; and finally the inwardness and isolation that shapes the aftermath of disappointment. All this is generated here on the level of the embodied experience of rhythms and gestures the audio-visual image performs. That way Bobby’s disappointment is not simply represented, but rather made sensible to the viewer.</p><p>In this section we aimed at exemplifying the way in which performative arts and media directly address human capacities for embodied perception and sensation. While we hope this exemplary analysis helped in making this conceivable, succeeding in this case only means to highlight the actual problem: how the experiential dynamics described over the course of this exemplary analysis can be addressed within the informational paradigm of computational analysis. The following section will be dedicated to outlining challenges and perspectives in trying to achieve such a computational methodology.</p><h2 id=2-addressing-human-experience-by-means-of-computational-analysis-the-ada-framework-for-video-annotation>2. Addressing human experience by means of computational analysis: The AdA-framework for video annotation</h2><p>The exemplary analysis above sketched out a systematic, qualitative approach to describing and qualifying the experiential qualities of audio-visual sequences that was developed in the field of film studies. Qualitative descriptions of expressive dynamics like this highlight the complexity as well as the variety of audio-visual composition: From lighting to camera movement to image composition to color grading to sound design to cutting rhythm to acting to choreographies and so on – the audio-visual image seems to encompass a sheer endless amount of formal levels. In addition, any compositional figuration of a multimodal audio-visual composition seems to realize a distinct way of making different of these countless levels interact. Furthermore, the foregrounding of certain dynamics within this interplay, the climaxes and accents that arise from it, are from our theoretical perspective tied to genuine phenomena of embodied perception. In short: Reconstructing these expressive dynamics of human experience in the way traditional scholarly work has operated – film-viewing and descriptions in natural language – seems to be resistant to any implementation as digital method or tool. However, we want to present a digital approach to film analysis in this section that is concerned exactly with these expressive dynamics and experiential qualities. The starting point in addressing these problems with regard to a data-driven computational approach to studies concerned with human experience turns out to be as simple as effortful: i.e. the task of producing extensive and detailed data on various different formal levels. The aim is to be able to retrace these expressive dynamics – as patterns – in a bottom-up perspective based on this data gathered on the micro level of audio-visual composition.</p><p>The turn to computational tools that shapes the methodological approach of our project is motivated by a research interest that highlights the practical limits of viewing and describing as a film analytical method.<sup id=fnref:53><a href=#fn:53 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>53</a></sup> Previous work in the many different exemplary case studies with the eMAEX methodology<sup id=fnref:54><a href=#fn:54 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>54</a></sup> has generated a tempting hypothesis: that the principles studied there yield generic systems of cinematic articulations on the micro-level of audio-visual composition and expressive dynamics. Taking the complexity and variety of these compositional principles into account, the concepts of repetition, variation and differentiation nevertheless open a path towards a typological study of expressive dynamics. Given the affective quality we attribute to these figurations of expressive movement, such a study aims at identifying a set of rhetorical tropes grounding audio-visual communication – i.e. at compositional gestures that mark the represented topics, constellations or concepts with affective qualities like tension, fear or euphoria, shaping the affective perspectives from which these topics emerge. To follow up on this hypothesis would require the comparative analysis of a large corpus of audio-visual material.</p><p>The AdA-project is dedicated to such an empirical study of a large corpus of audio-visual material – consisting of fictional feature films, documentaries and TV reports concerned with the global financial crisis (2007–) – with the aim of establishing a typological perspective on patterns of audio-visual expressivity. Given the discursive nature of crisis rhetorics – oscillating between the identification of a significant problem and the struggle for a solution – and the variety of audio-visual media, this corpus is considered suitable as an exemplary field of study. The project’s methodological approach brings together film scholars and computational scientists; it encompasses</p><p>the development and definition of a film analytical ontology, i.e. a systematic analytical vocabulary that follows the requirements of machine-readable semantic data management, as well as film analytical key concepts that are widely used in film studies, the annotation of extensive audio-visual material based on this vocabulary, combining tools for (semi-)automatic video analysis and manual annotations by expert annotators, as well as evaluation and application of machine learning and/or search algorithms in order to identify recurring patterns of audio-visual composition, in combination with tools for visualizing and querying complex sets of annotation data for scholars (a step that is going to be evaluated in the last phase of our project).</p><p>The latter step as well as the use of (semi-)automatic tools integrated within the annotation software will follow the human-in-the-loop model, i.e. all data generated by computational analysis will be corrected by film scholars in order to further train the applied tools.</p><p>Out of the variety of tools for manual and semi-automatic video annotation<sup id=fnref:55><a href=#fn:55 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>55</a></sup> , we have chosen the open-source video-annotation-software Advene, which was originally designed by Olivier Aubert, Yannick Prié and Pierre-Antoine Champin, to perform multi-author film analyses. Based on a cooperation with Olivier Aubert, Advene has been further adjusted and extended to meet the specific requirements of detailed scholarly film analysis – not only in regard to the (manual) annotation process but also regarding interfaces for a film analytical ontology, video retrieval and the support of RDF (a standard model for data interchange on the Web; see <a href=#agt-rickauer2018>Agt-Rickauer et al. 2018</a>).</p><p>The latter functions as the exchange format for a machine-readable film-analytical ontology, i.e. the structured vocabulary and data modelling which is the basis for the annotation process. The framework is set up to make semantically stored data readable by machines and humans. While most annotations in the AdA-project are manually created, the amount of (semi-)automated annotations is still to be expanded further within the framework of this methodology. The aim is to develop a basis for the joint integration of manual and (semi-)automatic annotations and facilitate future work on machine learning for which we have laid the groundwork by providing a structured vocabulary and the interfaces in the annotation tool.</p><p>In the following, we will address the challenges that arise with developing the ontology, the implication of a consistent video-annotation routine, and the development of visualizations which offer scholars a way to ‘read‘ into these extensive data sets. The section will be closed with a second look at the scene described at the end of the last section – now based on video annotation data and respective visualizations.</p><h2 id=21-challenge-1-establishing-a-machine-readable-vocabulary-and-data-structure>2.1 Challenge 1: Establishing a machine-readable vocabulary and data structure</h2><p>The main methodological goal in our project is to map reconstructions of film-viewing experience within a digital framework. We want this analytical framework to feature vocabulary that is as generic as possible in order to accommodate different strands of film and media studies, allowing all kinds of film and media scholars concerned with audio-visual material to ground their studies in empirical reconstructions of audio-visual composition. This means the innovative aspect of this line of work lies in a consistent as well as open process of data modelling that – in a best-case scenario – can serve as a fundamental starting point not only for our film analytical studies, but also for respective research projects in the field.</p><p>With regard to the variety of different forms of audio-visual material as well as our aim of conducting comparative corpus studies, we had to address the question of how to determine the parameters on which to analyze the flow of images and the granularity with which they are annotated.<sup id=fnref:56><a href=#fn:56 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>56</a></sup> Moreover, the annotation process – involving a group of multiple annotators – created the need for further systematic operationalization. These methodological considerations resulted in turning the focus on three basic requirements:</p><p>Creating a modularly structured vocabulary that is both grounded in a broad methodological film-analytical consensus and applicable with regard to specific theories on the aesthetic experience of audio-visual images (see Section 1.1). Setting up a mode of description that is defined, operationalized and condensed to a degree that allows for the – to the greatest possible extent – impartial annotation of audio-visual corpora carried out by a group of trained annotators. Defining the terms and procedures in a way that is explicit enough to allow researchers coming from different theoretical backgrounds to relate their approach critically to the analytic data.</p><p>With regard to the first point, we selected the vocabulary either directly from the broad and manifold spectrum of approaches to film analysis that focus on and describe formal elements of audio-visual composition or transformed film-analytical key concepts into annotatable keyword systematics.<sup id=fnref:57><a href=#fn:57 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>57</a></sup></p><p>In order to meet the requirements outlined above, we chose to arrange our annotation vocabulary within a threefold structure:</p><ul><li>Annotation levels (namely Segmentation, Language, ImageComposition, Camera, Montage, Acoustics, BodilyExpressivity and Motifs) are the primary categories that refer to different articulatory modes of cinematic staging principles. With regard to these macro categories, we followed upon the basic levels of the eMAEX framework (see Section 1.2).<sup id=fnref:58><a href=#fn:58 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>58</a></sup></li><li>For each level we defined a multitude of annotation types in order to systematically differentiate formal principles within these levels (e.g. CameraMovementDirection or CameraMovementSpeed). Thus, we identified analytical subdimensions that are restricted enough to provide a set of predefined terms or in exceptional cases a focussed description in free text format. Together these various types provide a basic and many-layered impression of the overarching categories. Camera is thus described as <em>Recording/Playback Speed, Depth Of Field, Defocus, Camera Movement Unit, Camera Movement Type, Camera Movement Speed, Camera Movement Direction, Camera Angle, Camera Angle Canted, Camera Angle, Vertical Positioning, Lens</em> . Needless to say, such an approach can never provide a complete description of all stylistic nuances but is rather designed to grasp central dynamics.</li><li>For each annotation type, we defined annotation values, determining the vocabulary that can be annotated. This third step provides the basis for the actual annotation process, that consists of linking these values to a specific time increment of a given video file based on its timecode. For example, in the case of CameraMovementDirection the values describe the basic directions a camera can move to (e.g. left, right, up, down, towards and away but also circle, canted and undirected for more complex movement patterns). Thereby the free-text-descriptions in the original eMAEX framework are replaced by data sets drawing on a (mostly) controlled vocabulary. Annotation types are based on different internal logics with regard to how they organize values. Some feature values in reference to an ordinal scale (e.g. Field Size), others follow the logic of nominal scales with no hierarchical order. This difference is especially of importance with regard to data visualization (see Section 2.3). Also, different annotation types within are based on different principles with regard to how and what vocabulary can be entered, leaving us with the possibility to work with free text when necessary.<sup id=fnref:59><a href=#fn:59 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>59</a></sup></li></ul><p>The resulting annotation routine encompasses 8 annotation levels, 78 annotation types and 502 annotation values. All of these different descriptive dimensions are published under creative commons license (ada.ontology.org), each accompanied by a short definition explaining the use of the vocabulary. The vocabulary is regularly updated as well as our set of annotations (including the 22.000 annotations generated over the course of our pilot case study on <em>The Company Men</em> ). So far the following films have been annotated: the feature films <em>The Company Men</em> (John Wells, USA 2010) and <em>The Big Short</em> (Adam McKay, USA 2015) as well as the documentaries <em>The Inside Job</em> (Charles Ferguson, USA 2010) and <em>Capitalism: A Love Story</em> (Michael Moore, USA 2009), furthermore a selection of features from the German TV News-Broadcast Tagesschau and the web clips Occupy Wall Street (Sem Maltsev, USA 2011) and <em>Where Do We Go From Here? Occupy Wall St.</em> (Ed David, USA 2011). All annotations are provided under creative commons licence at <a href=https://projectada.github.io>https://projectada.github.io</a> and can be browsed and queried through the annotation explorer web app: <a href=http://ada.filmontology.org/explorer/>http://ada.filmontology.org/explorer/</a>.</p><p>Our vocabulary has been modelled as a machine-readable semantic data structure that is essential for intertwining manual and (semi-)automatic annotations, enabling the future application of machine learning, data evaluation, and potential exchange of annotations between different researchers. The respective machine-readable data ontology was set up by Henning Agt-Rickauer. It stores all values possible within our annotation framework – not as a mere unstructured text, but instead modelling the relations and dependencies within all annotation values, types and levels (e.g. the interior logic of ordinal scales) with technologies of the semantic web.</p><blockquote><p>We have developed an automated process to generate the project ontology and semantic metadata of the video corpus directly from the input data using the RDF mapping language and RML tools. The ontology is imported into Advene and exposes the domain-specific vocabulary with unique URIs as annotation tracks in a timeline view so that semantic annotations conforming to the ontology can be exported. Annotations, metadata, and the ontology is published via the project&rsquo;s triple store.<br><sup id=fnref:60><a href=#fn:60 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>60</a></sup> Drawing on this interconnection of semantic technologies and tools for film analysis<br>“the project aims to provide an ontology for film-analytical studies complemented by a video annotation software adapted for authoring and publishing Linked Open Data by non-experts [in the field of semantic web technologies]<br><sup id=fnref:61><a href=#fn:61 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>61</a></sup> Hence, the adjusted version of the open-source software Advene can serve as a user-friendly interface, offering the advantages of semantically structured datasets to researchers without further programming skills. Annotating based on this semantic data ontology also provides the possibility to search and compare analyses based on complex queries, visualizations and other tools.</p></blockquote><p>Most importantly, by providing an ontological data structure a) drawing on film-analytical key concepts as well as b) featuring short definitions with regard to the whole controlled annotation vocabulary, we designed the video-annotation framework as open as possible with regard to film-analytical studies based on different theoretical frameworks and epistemologies – creating the possibility for other researchers to relate their annotations to ours and vice versa.<sup id=fnref:62><a href=#fn:62 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>62</a></sup> Thus empirical data for the analysis of audio-visual material can potentially be exchanged between projects with different research questions, theoretical backgrounds or even languages.<sup id=fnref:63><a href=#fn:63 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>63</a></sup></p><h2 id=22-challenge-2-setting-up-a-systematic-video-annotation-routine>2.2 Challenge 2: Setting up a systematic video-annotation routine</h2><p>With regard to the systematization of the video annotation, the goal was not to achieve a complete congruence of singular annotations but rather an intersubjective identification of the progression of several annotations. The dynamics of audiovisual expressivity unfold their meaning – like a melody – in the dynamic progressions over time and not in the attribution of singular values at static points in time. For example, a comparison of scene analyses by different annotators made us see that a common pattern of increasingly closer field sizes was clearly detectable even when singular decisions such as between medium closeup or shoulder closeup diverged. This fuzziness of individual annotation values is not an artefact of manual annotation but grounded in the nature of the object of study, since the film analytical concepts do not designate discrete entities – any computational distinction between, say, a close-up and a shoulder close-up is purely arbitrary. Spoken within the music metaphor: the aim of the systematization is the common recognition of a melody and not primarily that of individual notes.</p><p>In order to advance the annotation with our film-analytical vocabulary from a proof-of-concept state to an application-oriented methodological framework, we set up a systematic routine with the need to operationalize the process in a number of ways. In the development phase of this vocabulary, we regularly met with our expert annotators to ensure a high degree of (intersubjective) consistency of our annotation data as well as having immediate feedback on the practicality of the various concepts. Based on these repeated feedback loops, definitions for each level, type and value were acquired that guide analytical decisions during annotations. These definition texts constitute the first results of our ongoing research process. Additional insights are fixated in a technical and in a methodical manual that will be published and translated at the end of the project.</p><p>Furthermore, since annotating manually within the presented framework is very labour intensive – given the vast number of annotation types and values –, we had to speed up the annotation process. On the one hand, this became possible by adjusting the user interface (UI), particularly the manual aspects of video annotation (e.g. the input of values, but also the evaluation and correction of annotated values). On the other hand, the manifold description levels can be streamlined in order to analyze a larger amount of films for corpus studies. Finally – as mentioned in the introduction to this section –, we make use of some (semi-)automatic annotations based on digital tools, the possibilities of which are still to be evaluated further and implemented.</p><p>Regarding the UI, we optimized the manual input of controlled vocabulary through autocomplete and short keys. This allows for a quick enrichment of preexisting segments (e.g. shots or music pieces), especially with regard to annotation types with reduced input options. Combined with short key controls of the video player and switching between annotations, the annotation speed was increased. To offer the annotators an improved overview of the various annotation types (displayed as tracks within Advene’s timeline-view), we developed a color code for all types, grouping them visually according to the respective annotation levels.</p><p>Also, over the course of the annotation of <em>The Company Men</em> , we partly re-oriented the annotation process towards longer segments.<sup id=fnref:64><a href=#fn:64 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>64</a></sup> In turn, we implemented the combination of multiple values for annotation types that can change even within small segments. Since the field size, for example, can change through camera movements or movements within the image, there was a need to implement a simple syntax of combining values within a segment. Therefore, we have established the syntax values [TO] to indicate developments between values (e.g. closeup,[TO],medium shot, indicating that all field sizes between these values are passed) and [VS] to indicate two simultaneous, conflicting dynamics within a segment (for example the expressive body language for a shot encompassing two figures can be annotated as happy,[VS],sad).</p><p>But even with these simplifications, annotating large amounts of audio-visual material on about eighty different description levels remains an extremely time-consuming task. Since the importance of formal levels can vary within the context of different guiding questions and theories, we selected a subset of annotation types for the running AdA-project that allows film scholars to identify the basic compositional principles of a film based on a reduced set of twenty annotation types (with the possibility of annotating additional types for a selection of key scenes) from all annotation levels.</p><p>As mentioned above, (semi-)automatic video analysis tools offer another promising way of significantly speeding up video-annotation processes. Based on the interactions of expert annotators and automated tools (with the level of human interference depending on the amount of training the respective tool demands), an increasing proportion of manual annotation work on some (but not all) types could be (semi-)automatized in the long run. On the other hand, this bears the risk that automatically detectable traits are overemphasized for pragmatic reasons, thus creating a bias for easily created quantifiable metadata. In order to avoid respective data distortions, we decided to set up an analysis framework based on manual description first – and then evaluate the potentials for detector implementation step-by-step.</p><p>Following this approach, we want to briefly discuss a few automated features that have been integrated in the annotation process so far, with others still being evaluated or in a developmental stage. Already implemented in Advene was an open-source shot detection and a graphic user interface to correct the results manually (see Figure 6).</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,
800w, w" class=landscape><figcaption><p>Advene’s shot-validation view.</p></figcaption></figure><p>In addition, we use a second proprietary detector to analyze shot transitions which achieved much better results on fades, wipes and other continuous transitions. With approximately 1.500 frame-precise annotated shots over the course of a film with a two-hour runtime, the feature of automatically detecting cuts and shot transitions can be seen as a huge advance in comparison to manual work – especially given the essential function of the shot segment as basic micro segmentation with regard to many other annotation types.</p><p>Another already widely used automated tool depicts the general volume of a video file’s audio track as a soundwave, allowing to quickly grasp which sections of a film are especially calm or loud and where sudden changes in volume occur (see Figure 7) – a feature we use, for example, in order to quickly identify peaks in volume, such as the prominent use of loud music or sudden noises like a gunshot.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,
800w, w" class=landscape><figcaption><p>Waveform implementation in Advene’s timeline-view.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Another field with a high potential of automatization that is still in the state of evaluation concerns written and spoken words. Especially regarding audio-visual material where subtitles<sup id=fnref:65><a href=#fn:65 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>65</a></sup> are not available, automatic language recognition can provide a solid base for manual corrections or – at least – a general indication where language appears and where not. Since our project features non-English documentaries and German television news, the discrepancy between English and other speech-to-text tools became evident. Regardless of the technological base, a human correction of transcoded dialogue is currently still indispensable. In light of our goal to produce an open and free framework, we refrained from using language processing from Amazon or Google which might provide better results.</p><p>Other areas for applying computational analysis that are currently under development are color detection,<sup id=fnref:66><a href=#fn:66 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>66</a></sup> automatic detection of aspect ratio and optical flow-analysis. In addition, there have been convincing attempts at using algorithms for face detection in order to automatically detect field sizes <sup id=fnref:67><a href=#fn:67 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>67</a></sup>. But however promising the values for precision and recall may be, they are still in a range that is more feasible to statistical abstractions and distant viewing than to the needs of a precise qualitative reconstruction. Therefore, they would still need a lot of manual corrections in order to obtain continuous correct field-size-annotations for a full-length film. So far, the automatically generated annotations did in many other cases not comply with the manual annotations based on human perception in an acceptable margin. Future research will have to show which of these tools can be adjusted to the requirements of a qualitative close viewing to a degree that makes manual correction obsolete or manageable.</p><h2 id=23-challenge-3-developing-visualizations-for-patterns-of-audio-visual-composition>2.3 Challenge 3: Developing visualizations for patterns of audio-visual composition</h2><p>After discussing the strategies for improving the process of entering and correcting annotations, we want to discuss the challenge that arises from annotating a film extensively: How to work with this complex set of data, without leaving the reading of data solely to algorithms and statistics? For an encompassing analytical approach, the question of assembling and relating annotations becomes relevant. As mentioned before, the film The Company Men was annotated<sup id=fnref:68><a href=#fn:68 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>68</a></sup> across 66 different annotation types which led to a data set of approximately 22.000<sup id=fnref:69><a href=#fn:69 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>69</a></sup> annotations for a single feature film.</p><p>This amount of metadata of course raises the question of readability which we will be discussing in the following by describing our visualization efforts. The visualization of our complex data sets can produce immediate insight into a composition and provide the involved film scholars with the possibility of guiding software-based searches for recurring compositional patterns.</p><p>Referring to the arrangement of a timeline with x and y axis, such a reading of annotations has a horizontal and a vertical dimension. In this context, horizontal refers to the temporal succession of annotations, whereas vertical refers to the synchronicity of annotations (i.e. values) assigned to different annotation types. In terms of this basic distinction, different forms of visualization with different advantages are possible and necessary for specific purposes. Thus, not a single visualization paradigm (e.g. multilayered timeline, histogram of a single type, etc.) can be singled out. In turn, a toolbox of different ways to enter and read annotation data has to be provided, that varies according to the respective research interest and theoretical framework. For example, data may be presented in a table or a timeline.<sup id=fnref:70><a href=#fn:70 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>70</a></sup></p><p>The visualization of values in a timeline allows for a quick and intuitive understanding of the length of single annotations as well as the rhythm and the compositional patterns they form together with other annotations. With regard to our research on audio-visual rhetorics of affect and the comparative analysis of compositional patterns, this contextualization of single values is crucial.<sup id=fnref:71><a href=#fn:71 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>71</a></sup></p><p>In our joint efforts with Olivier Aubert, a visualization feature was developed that is precisely adapted to our research project’s comparative scope: the AdA-timeline (demo: <a href=https://olivieraubert.net/hpi/timeline.html>https://olivieraubert.net/hpi/timeline.html</a>).<sup id=fnref:72><a href=#fn:72 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>72</a></sup> The respective diagrams (see Figure 8) can be directly generated with Advene, offering the possibility to instantly adapt to changing or developing sets of annotations.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,
800w, w" class=landscape><figcaption><p>Screenshot of the AdA-timeline generated with Advene.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The basic idea behind this mode of visualization can be described as making a selection of annotation types readable like a musical score of an orchestra piece, displaying audio-visual rhythms as graphical patterns. Here we draw on film scores from theorists like Sergej Eisenstein <sup id=fnref:73><a href=#fn:73 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>73</a></sup>, but also newer examples developed in projects like “Digital Formalism” or “Cinemetrics” as well as on scores Jan-Hendrik Bakels developed in his book on audio-visual rhythms <sup id=fnref1:44><a href=#fn:44 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>44</a></sup>.</p><p>For example, the dynamics of FieldSize in Figure 9 can be grasped visually; extrema are more easily and quickly detected than in a single-line depiction.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

By marking a segment in this timeline, it is possible to zoom into the respective subsegment – switching from a micro-perspective of a few seconds to an overview of the whole film within an instance. Below this zoom bar is a histogram of shot length (similar to Cinemetrics’ visualizations) displayed for the currently selected segment.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

Furthermore, it is possible to choose and display only a selection of annotation types within the diagram, to change their color palettes, to switch between different representations (such as single line, horizontal bar graph and, in some types, histograms and waveforms), and to connect the browser-based visualization with an embedded video player, so that by clicking on an annotation, the respective segment can be watched.</p><p>Another way to navigate and/or filter the diagram could be to combine it with query interfaces, identifying scenes across the corpus based on complex sets of search parameters (e.g. a search for all segments where closeups occur while sad music is playing). Currently, Henning Agt-Rickauer is developing such an interface in cooperation with Joscha Jäger – the annotation explorer,<sup id=fnref:74><a href=#fn:74 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>74</a></sup> which is based on FrameTrail – for the AdA-project.<sup id=fnref:75><a href=#fn:75 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>75</a></sup> In combination with graphical evaluations of visualizations and query tools, an image search developed by Christian Hentschel is another useful tool for a comparative navigation of the corpus in regard to motif studies and the analysis of the modulation of affective profiles.</p><p>In this section’s last subchapter, we will take a second and last look into the scene from <em>The Company Men</em> described within the eMAEX framework above (see Section 1.3) in order to present a short use case for the methodology outlined in this section.</p><h2 id=24-exemplary-analysis-ii-studying-the-company-men-based-on-visualized-video-annotation-data>2.4 Exemplary Analysis II: Studying The Company Men based on visualized video-annotation data</h2><p>Over the course of this second look at our exemplary scene, we want to show how the outlined affective parcours (from excitement, joyful expectation, and bafflement to sad isolation), as well as the described EMUs and their figurations, can be detected and substantiated within a bottom-up perspective by retracting compositional patterns from our annotation data or its visualization. The initial and decisive step, i.e. the segmentation of the scene into four EMUs, can already be retraced within a brief overview of a selection of annotation types and the respective annotations. Figure 11 shows an excerpt from the Advene timeline view, depicting annotations according to annotation types and in their temporal expansion.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

John Wells, USA 2010.</p></figcaption></figure><p>We described the first EMU – which we qualified as an abruptly emerging, then continually rising energy – as a figuration of suddenly increasing vitality that is predominantly shaped through bodily expressivity,<sup id=fnref:77><a href=#fn:77 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>77</a></sup> montage<sup id=fnref:78><a href=#fn:78 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>78</a></sup> and the acoustic composition<sup id=fnref:79><a href=#fn:79 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>79</a></sup> of the segment. The drastic change in the acting style can be observed in the annotation type BodyLanguageIntensity<sup id=fnref:80><a href=#fn:80 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>80</a></sup> (see Figure 13) in which the intensity is rated on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high intensity). Whereas the first shot is rated low (1) and in the second shot a low (1) and a medium (3) intensity are confronted, the intensity rises again – rather abruptly – in the third shot with the contrast of 5 and 4, i.e. a discussion between the protagonist and his wife. This gradual rise of BodyLanguageIntensity overall, as well as the sudden significant increase – which can be ascribed to Bobby’s (Ben Affleck) BodyLanguageIntensity – is accompanied by an increase in volume that can be traced in the waveform depiction. In this second half, the ShotDuration<sup id=fnref:81><a href=#fn:81 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>81</a></sup> shows a particular rhythm: several short shots with closer field sizes showing Bobby or his wife are followed by a longer medium shot of the bedroom (each with Bobby’s wife facing the camera in the background). This specific pattern repeats and gradually accelerates during this segment – with a slight deceleration at the end of the scene.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

John Wells, USA 2010.</p></figcaption></figure><p>We described the second EMU – which we qualified as vivid directedness – as a swelling figuration. Based on the annotations it becomes apparent how the music is dominant in this regard: i.e. its increasing volume which can be deduced again from the waveform and that correlates with an increasing MusicIntensity.<sup id=fnref:82><a href=#fn:82 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>82</a></sup> The latter was annotated as rising from 1 to 3 (on a scale from 1 to 5). Furthermore, this music piece was qualified by our annotators as upbeat, happy music.</p><p>In addition, the swelling dynamics of the music piece interact with other annotation types. As the bottom of the Advene timeline view in Figure 14 shows, the image brightens<sup id=fnref:83><a href=#fn:83 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>83</a></sup> continually from dark shots (black) over bright-dark shots (contrast of bright and dark parts of the image depicted in light grey annotations) to consistently medium light sequences (in medium grey annotations), while at the same time the ColourRange<sup id=fnref:84><a href=#fn:84 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>84</a></sup> used by the film changes distinctly. Furthermore, the swelling movement is constituted through an increasingly dynamic cinematography, identifiable by the use of faster camera movements at the end (see the red annotation type CameraMovementSpeed<sup id=fnref:85><a href=#fn:85 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>85</a></sup> that changes from slow to medium).</p><p>In the last part of the segment, the camera interacts with the image intrinsic movement (see the yellow annotation type ImageIntrinsicMovement<sup id=fnref:86><a href=#fn:86 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>86</a></sup> that describes the perceived degree of movement within a shot on a scale from 0 to 3; in this segment, the dynamicity varies between 1 and 2 before reaching its climax with 3 shortly before the end of the sequence). Overall, the image intrinsic movement thus shows a course of increasing intensity, that comes to an abrupt halt when the last shot of the segment depicts in an extreme low angle a static shot of the company building that was qualified as a 0.</p><p>We can summarize this second expressive movement as a swelling movement, where the music intensity, the camera movement speed, as well as the image intrinsic movement jointly rise over the course of the segment. The brightening of the image, the upbeat music, as well as the facial expression together with the directedness of the camera movement and the general vividness of the image shape this swelling as a vivid directedness, finding its finale in front of the seemingly gigantic company building (extreme low angle).</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

Within the FieldSize<sup id=fnref:87><a href=#fn:87 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>87</a></sup> annotations, a shifting dynamic between closeness and abrupt distancing can be retraced. This happens twice in this EMU: a first instance briefly in the beginning, and a second more emphasized one in the last shot. At the first instance (see dark purple annotation in Figure 15), a medium long shot of Bobby standing at the reception desk is followed by a closer medium shot of him sitting down (pink annotation). By again jumping away in the third shot (green annotation), the cinematography creates a tension.</p><p>This pattern is repeated in a rather emphasized manner and prolonged at the second instance towards the end of the EMU: The camera approaches the conversation between the protagonist and the assistant in a series of medium closeups, before returning abruptly to a medium long shot in the very last shot of the segment (see Figure 15). This second distancing movement is accompanied by a sudden silence on the level of dialogue (see the absence of purple annotations in the type DialogueText<sup id=fnref:88><a href=#fn:88 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>88</a></sup> in Figure 15). We qualify this moment of irritation, the abrupt change by means of a distancing movement accompanied by a sudden silence, as the experience of vividness put abruptly to rest.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

John Wells, USA 2010.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The fourth and last EMU of this scene – which we qualified as an experience of slowly being isolated – is identified as a figuration of an intensifying deceleration and contraction which can be substantiated as follows: Reversing the distancing movement of the last segment, this expressive movement is characterized by a gesture of approaching, realized through montage and camera movement. The camera approaches the protagonist until we see him in a shoulder closeup (the closest field size used in this scene; see Figure 16). On the acoustic level, music sets in – which is qualified as sad and intense. The observed movement dynamics within the frame at this moment are especially interesting: Two separate movement intensities are identified, so that two separate values are given and related via a [VS] syntax element. This derives from the harsh contrast between the static protagonist in the image centre and his dynamic surrounding (various moving passersby). Whereas the interplay of moving image parts was perceived before as directed or harmonic, it is now classified as chaotic, thus changing the underlying impression. Overall, we can describe this movement figuration of a camera closing in on the protagonist’s tensionless face accompanied by sad and intense music and with a diverging movement dynamicity within the frame as figuration of an intensifying deceleration and contraction.</p><p>In summary, the scene as a whole creates an image of disappointment, realized by the succession of an abruptly emerging, then continually rising energy and vivid directedness, over a constricted vividness that is abruptly put to rest, before slowly retreating into isolation. This affective course can, as we hope to have shown, easily be identified on the basis of the compositional patterns that appear in the structured annotation of the scene. This bottom-up perspective enables even scholars not trained in qualitative description of expressive movements to identify the respective patterns.</p><p>The systematic description of these audiovisual patterns is no end in itself, but should enable us to search for similar patterns in the wider corpus of films. Drawing on the presented analysis, we can hypothesize that scenes of experiencing disappointment are recurring throughout our corpus. We can now condense the observed pattern in our annotation data to some core traits: a shift from happy to sad music mood<sup id=fnref:89><a href=#fn:89 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>89</a></sup> (with a pause in-between); closer field sizes at the end and a high image intrinsic movement correlating with the annotation of happy music. In Figure 17, a responsive and zoomable timeline view (see Section 2.3) of the scene (titled) “Wrong Date” shows some of these key traits. For example, a blue-coloured bar in the annotation type MusicMood at the bottom visualizing the value happy is followed by a short segment without annotation, then a red-coloured bar visualizing the value sad.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

AdA-timeline.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Our growing annotation database allows us to query for scenes that meet these criteria. In Figure 18 below, you can see a graphical comparison with a second scene from <em>The Company Men</em> . The scene “Bobby’s last paycheck” (bottom) occurs earlier in the film, meeting the same criteria regarding the happy-sad change in music as well as the approaching camera at the end of the scene. Synchronously with the annotated happy music you see as in the other scene a high intensity (value: 3) of ImageIntrinsicMovement as well as more (shoulder) closeups in the segment with sad MusicMood. In our exemplary scene we saw that this pattern was an indicator and element of the scene’s affective parcours (of excitement, joyful expectation, bafflement to sad isolation). A further in-depth analysis of this second scene would show that it does indeed stage – a slightly varied – image of disappointment.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="500w,

John Wells, USA 2010.</p></figcaption></figure><p>This analysis so far has shown that we can conduct a detailed analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics in moving images on the micro level based upon empirical data from the annotation of a largely controlled vocabulary. Over the course of this exemplary study, we hope to have shown how to determine key characteristics of single analyses and search for these characteristics within the film (and throughout a larger corpus) in order to find similar scenes. This enables us to identify recurring affective profiles within a corpus and thus allows us to make detailed and empirically-based claims about larger groups of films – focusing on the dynamic unfolding of scenes and their experiential quality.</p><h2 id=3-matching-computational-analysis-and-human-experience--conclusion-and-perspectives>3. Matching Computational Analysis and Human Experience – Conclusion and Perspectives</h2><p>In this article we have focused on the requirements, challenges and proposed solutions we have identified within the research goal of matching computational means of analysis and interpretation with the theoretically deduced primacy of experience in media reception. The sketched-out film analytical framework is no one-fits-all-solution for analyzing audiovisual media, and there are still many questions unanswered – and even not yet asked. But we hope that this is also read as a contribution to the ongoing development of Digital Humanities methodologies which are – at least with regard to audio-visual images – still largely in a phase of fast development.</p><p>Apart from the concrete hypotheses, measures and findings that we have presented, we want to outline in this conclusion the underlying epistemological and disciplinary principles that are of importance to us and that also resonate in some recent debates about the directions that the field of Digital Humanities is taking:</p><p>The dichotomy between the close and the distant, the qualitative and the quantitative – as well as between the digital and the analog, incidentally – should not be considered as mutually excluding and framed in a discourse that emphasizes deficiency. We rather have to find means to foreground the inherent hybridity and scalability that works within the Digital Humanities and make it productive in as many ways as we can <sup id=fnref:90><a href=#fn:90 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>90</a></sup>. It is thus important to us to emphasize the circumstance that this kind of research program is not proposed as a substitution to established methods and frameworks, but rather as a promising addition to the methodological toolboxes of the different disciplines.</p><p>It has also been established quite often, that the hybridity of the Digital Humanities necessitates (at least) two translation efforts and literacies <sup id=fnref:91><a href=#fn:91 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>91</a></sup>: One concerns humanities scholar who may not have to become a programmer but at least has to develop a basic understanding of how codes, databases and interfaces work. But the other translation is equally important: The possibilities of computation are highly problematic from a techno-political point of view, as long as they are not viewed from specific theoretical perspectives and research questions that are derived from concrete problems of knowledge and understanding. In order to relate aesthetic theory of embodied perception and methods from computational sciences, a common ground has to be found that deviates from the standards of the involved disciplines and always runs the risk to seem incompatible with conventional self-understandings – a predicament that a lot of inter- and transdisciplinary research has to face.</p><p>In our case, we proceeded from a theoretical concept of embodied experience and expressive movement patterns in audio-visual images. We were confronted with the task to translate this into a data structure that was accessible to computational processing. One important side effect of this and other frameworks is that it encourages collaborative research – annotating together, re-using analytical data with new questions – even though a lack of universal file formats and standard software still makes the exchange and implementation in the scholarly communities difficult. We followed the idea that ways of grasping compositional patterns in fine-grained analytical reflection certainly exceed human capacities when they are applied to larger corpora, but that this could be achieved by combining a systematic, theory-guided production of large amounts of data. This implied a different look at data as compared to previous, digital and non-digital modes of data collection in film and media studies, which did not start from the maximum of fine-grained analytical access but from a minimum of easily quantifiable features <sup id=fnref1:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. It also implied a changing perspective on computational methods since it emphasizes a holistic consideration of formal structures within audio-visual material that overarches the enterprise of formalizing any individual feature for algorithmic detection. (So far, our experience in the implementation of automatic feature detection has highlighted the need for further development in this field, but we are convinced that this is a question of time and appropriate training data that ideally also takes into account manual annotations that are collected with a view towards aesthetic structures. The flipside of this assessment is the fact that the time effort of largely manual annotations and the training of expert annotators is still a disadvantage considering the average infrastructure of research projects.)</p><p>We want to propose our Data Model as a possible framework for such a holistic consideration that not only provides a modular, structured coding system for the many levels of audio-visual analysis, but also offers a view on connecting these levels in order to achieve the further application of methods like search algorithms and machine learning. One future direction of this research lies in the further use of manually gathered annotation data to train algorithms not only in the detection of single features but in the identification of recurring patterns. The other – associated – field of application is the further development of standardized visualizations and the implementation of complex cross-modal queries.</p><p>The basic framework provided by the AdA filmontology aims at providing a first encompassing data structure for the various stylistic levels of cinematic expressivity – with all the advantages and disadvantages that come with such an ambitious ‘global’ approach. We still hope that the general steps that we tried to sketch out over the course of this article can serve as orientation for similar endeavors in other disciplines of performative, time-based arts and media. These programmatic steps involve identifying possible starting points with regard to addressing intersubjective bases of experience, setting up a systemized machine-readable vocabulary addressing these bases, making use of visualizations and computational methods in order to identify complex, recurring patterns. With regard to these epistemological steps, temporality and patterning could serve as a common denominator for the larger field of integrating digital tools and the study of performative, time-based arts and media.</p><p>With these preliminary results, we hope to give new impulses for the nexus between film analytical research and the implementation of digital tools based on a machine- and human-readable defined vocabulary. We started from the finding that algorithms are not profound in reconstructing the bases of experiential qualities like feelings. But when confronted with a research question that takes a look at a larger corpus of audio-visual material, one soon finds that it is not strictly speaking possible to objectify and empirically compare these experiential qualities apart from the compositional patterns in which they are grounded. It is this diversion via setting up a systemized machine-readable vocabulary addressing the intersubjective bases of film-viewing on the level of modeled data, that makes it possible to match algorithmically interpreted and generated annotations with research interested in the experiential qualities of film.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Salt, B. <em>Film Style and Technology: History and Analysis</em> .

These protocols are then merged. Guiding for this segmentation are narrative clusters (indicated through leaps in diegetic time or a change of settings), thematic and discourse units as well as audio-visual units (e.g. with fade-to-blacks or music usage as prominent markers, but also more complex changes in the staging mode, e.g. from a fast-paced action-sequence to a shot-reverse-shot conversation). In other contexts, scenes are defined along paratexts from the production (screenplays) or publication (DVD/Bluray-chapters). Since these divisions are often not congruent with each other and exclude the viewer experience completely, they are not applicable to our research focus.&#160;<a href=#fnref:51 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:52><p>An ideology-critical reading of the film <em>The Company Men</em> (John Wells, USA 2010) as a whole and its conservative take on gender roles and economics can be found in <sup id=fnref:106><a href=#fn:106 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>106</a></sup>.&#160;<a href=#fnref:52 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:53><p>In regard to the practical limits of the film analytical method, the turn to the field of digital video-analysis tools is closely connected with the hope for saving time: the qualitative description of audio-visual sequences (e.g. within the eMAEX framework) is extremely time consuming. Analyzing a film or video in most cases takes a multiple of their running times. And the manual annotation on a high number of formal levels within a large corpus of audio-visual material threatens to be no less time-consuming. However the emerging field of video analysis and retrieval within the computational sciences has developed a lot of tools for (semi-)automatically analyzing formal aspects of audio-visual material.&#160;<a href=#fnref:53 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:54><p>See Endnote 6.&#160;<a href=#fnref:54 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:55><p>Various video-annotation software in the past decades have developed different approaches to creating working environments with different emphases: From collaborative live-tagging of videos (LookAt, OpenVideoAnnotation, TRAVIS) to the depiction of automatic concept detection (VATIC), the coding of audiovisual data in the tradition of empirical social research (MAXQDA, AQUAD), real-time annotators for shot frequency and field size (Cinemetrics), the measurement of specific aspects of a film (e.g. shot length in Cinemetrics) to layer based tools for complex annotations with free text or controlled vocabularies (ADVENE, ANVIL, ELAN, VIAN). Researchers interested in complex, dynamic and multimodal film analysis have mainly used the latter. Especially the timeline of a film, a video player and visually separated annotation layers for observations in different description levels provide the backbone of most annotation programs used in the field. These interfaces are similar to those of popular video editing programs like Adobe Premiere, Final Cut or Avid (that are also sometimes transformed into annotation programs by scholars, c.f. <a href=#jacobs2016>Jacobs and Fyfe 2016</a>). The timeline indicates in this sense the relevance of the aspect of temporality for the analysis of audiovisual images that can be also seen governing the central principle of (temporal) segmentation put at work in our praxis of video annotation. Besides the graphically adjustable timeline especially the in-application generation of visualizations and multimedia publications were decisive factors for our initial choice for Advene.&#160;<a href=#fnref:55 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:56><p>The question of segmentation is not only relevant to macro units – scenes or compositional segments that can only be grasped cross-modaly like the EMU –, but is raised by every single annotation on any level of description.&#160;<a href=#fnref:56 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:57><p>As an example for film-analytical key concepts, the basic distinctions of mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing, sound that can be found in propaedeutic literature on film analysis <sup id=fnref:107><a href=#fn:107 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>107</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:108><a href=#fn:108 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>108</a></sup> can serve as points of orientation.&#160;<a href=#fnref:57 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:58><p>We slightly adapted the basic levels of the eMAEX framework: e.g. we transformed gestures and facial expression to BodilyExpressivity or added the level Language for the semantic dimension of written and spoken word, due to its heightened role in TV-news and some documentaries. The level Segmentation addresses macro-units (e.g. scenes and EMUs). The basic division into subunits (scenes and shots) is undertaken prior to splitting up the film into various packages along the scene-units to allow a synchronous annotation by multiple annotators; the segmentation into EMUs is carried out later in this revised process, based on the detailed annotation data.&#160;<a href=#fnref:58 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:59><p>In some annotation types, we refer to concepts that derive from the specific films and cannot be anticipated beforehand; in other cases longer sentences are needed to describe more complex figurations that oppose the restrictions of a defined vocabulary.
