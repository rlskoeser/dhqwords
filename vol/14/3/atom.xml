<p>Humanities work is changing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A historian in Northern Europe uses Facebook, Youtube and other social media to study memory of dissent. She sees social media as a valuable resource for the study of memory shaped by public access and personal interactions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A memory studies scholar from Bulgaria admits that the starting point for her research is often a term written into a Google search tab, which later develops as a ‘snowball’ helping to find essential websites for the study of cultural memory.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>These examples, selected out of many stemming from our meta-research into digital practices in the humanities (i.e. the study of research carried out with the help of digital technologies), illustrate how technology is penetrating unevenly into different stages of the research process: the discovery phase ( <em>search &amp; access to research data</em> ); gathering activities ( <em>data collection</em> ); conceptual work and organization of one’s research assets ( <em>data curation</em> ), and computer-assisted analysis of the research assets ( <em>data analysis</em> ). Invariably, these examples also problematise the institutional, custodial, and disciplinary nature of humanities research conducted within the confines of the physical archive, the geographically bounded community of scholars, and the materially constrained toolset of a single discipline. If scholarly research often now appears to transcend locality and place, methodological approaches to studying how scholars work should also adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>As we come to reflect on how humanities research is shaped today by the physical and material factors that condition the work of researchers, as well as the new capabilities that the digital ecosystem affords, we see that there are micro-practices — visible in those examples described above — that fall outside both the traditional humanistic methods and what is usually considered Digital Humanities (DH). We understand DH in the broadest possible sense, as the  “big tent”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of digital practices, methods, tools and resources which inform various disciplines in the humanities. Moreover, we do not limit its scope to the core DH community of researchers advancing cutting-edge methodologies, but also look at scholars who would never call themselves digital humanists yet do take advantage of the digital to answer their non-digital research questions. Big tent DH recognizes that the importance of the digital is not limited to the use of computational, algorithmic methods for research, but has to do with the broader shift of the whole paradigm of humanities proper: the centrality of digital resources and access to them for all kinds of humanities work; changes in scholarly communication, peer review and publication where digital and online systems are central, inter- and cross-disciplinarity; as well as working with open content and open data, both digitised and born digital.</p>
<p>In this way, we can see how research practices are fundamentally unpredictable: they do not fall under the umbrella of a single custodial environment but are rather assembled as a local response to a single project’s needs. To assemble them involves repeated acts of bricolage, tinkering with moving parts that were not designed to work together. Nowhere is the impact of this status more present than in the situatedness of humanities research, that is in the (self-) management of its physical, virtual and mental spaces. SPARKLE (Scholarly Primitives And Renewed Knowledge-Led Exchanges), one of the studies we reference below, showed in particular the degree to which location and spatial configuration were felt by the researchers interviewed to be integral to the productivity of the humanistic scholar <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. We are perhaps used to this aspect of, for example, archive-based work, due to the external constraints of opening hours, reading rooms, and all the rest of what Arlette Farge refers to as their  “absurd rules of operation”   <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. But what perhaps has its roots in a time-management challenge progresses into what manifests as a highly individualised and expertly tuned set of spatial strategies. Even in the relatively small SPARKLE sample, there was essentially no agreement, of where the ‘best place’ to work might be. In part this was a reflection of adaptation to different life circumstances: senior academics with teaching and administrative responsibilities seemed generally to find their offices more rife with distraction than their home spaces, for example. It also sometimes indicated a separation, or multiple separations, between administrative work, personal life and research work. But even these general rules had exceptions, where the desire for work-life balance created yet further variation (libraries or coffee shops, for example, or working in the office but out of business hours, on weekends or in the evening).</p>
<p>The nature of humanities research as being physically unbounded, or perhaps, more precisely, loosely and alternatingly bound to multiple places (the office, the archive, the classroom, indeed even the virtual environment or page of writing etc.) places it in stark contrast to laboratory science, in which the nature of the work space is very specific and determined, forming (at its most extreme extension) a guarantor of scientific credibility, that is a clean or controlled environment. The contrast between the closed physical space of the laboratory and nomadic nature of the humanistic knowledge-creation process, with its constant refreshing of sources, backdrops and inspirations, is reminiscent of the contrast between farmed agriculture and the hunter gatherer, with the pre-agrarian mode of subsistence being perhaps more dependent on shifting availability of resources in a wider space, but benefitting instead from a more multisensory, kinetic and synthetic mode of cultivation.</p>
<p>The idea that objects should be organised in physical and mental space also interconnects with another theme that appeared across our study, which is that knowledge creation is an embodied process, encompassing far more than just the brain and its focussed sense of sight as an organ for processing source inputs. This is no less true in virtual than in physical spaces. Separation (of tasks, of ideas) and integration (of source material, with a community) are constantly in balance in the epistemic process, to the extent that one interviewee stressed the importance of technology for him in making it possible to access his entire personal source library from his computer at all times. These mental and physical environments, as well as the broader sensory world, of those engaged in historical humanistic research leads to an enduring dominance of multimodal personal research environments. In spite of the rise of digital humanities (which some, but not all, of the interviewees had embraced), historians still prefer to have notes, notebooks, pencils, post-its, books, printouts, and all manner of stimuli around them, in addition to their laptops and digital tools. This set of hybrid practices, spaces and tools are therefore customised to the questions and the knowledge base of the researcher(s) using them, and yet must also be flexible enough to accommodate research teams that evolve over time, software that is continually versioning up, and workflows that must be reinvented with every new experiment, even as they expand to incorporate new technological affordances. How can we study this kind of subtle and evolving phenomenon?</p>
<p>This paper proposes an approach to qualitative meta-research into contemporary scholarship which enables us to track and understand novel research practices and assess their impact on scholarly activity as a whole. Our approach is based on several pilot studies, and our goal has been to use these studies as “ground truth” to support a theoretically-informed, highly original methodological framework for qualitative research on DH practice: a self-reflexive approach to DH practice which is often overlooked in existing empirical studies. The primary audience of this paper, given its methodological scope, are DH researchers willing to either conduct meta-research, or to critically evaluate their own work. We believe that this kind of research should be of interest to researchers willing to understand their own method and be empowered to be critical about their work (in particular people embarking on large-scale collaborative projects). Additionally, anyone interested in interdisciplinarity should find much to think about here as well. Beyond the academic, anyone looking to fund, evaluate, promote or integrate DH (whether as a Dean or funder or research manager or policy maker) could make use of this perspective.</p>
<p>The rationale for meta-research in DH, viewed as an integrative framework, could be explained in four dimensions: ontology (how do we conceptualize the domain of research), epistemology (what is the knowledge we are seeking to produce), axiology (what values shape the object and process of our research, i.e., the infamous so what question), and methodology (research design and method selection to address these issues).</p>
<p>At the ontological level we conceive of DH research as a practice based on symbolic interactions involving purposeful action by researchers. Hence DH is treated not merely as empirical reality (accessible only through empirical study) but also as consisting of such elements as motivations and norms of researchers, or goals and objectives served by their research choices, or the criteria, often implicit, of what constitutes good research. These ontological commitments bring our work close to the model of purposeful human activity established by cultural-historical activity theory <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Figure 1 offers an informal model representing this ontological view.</p>
<p>As for epistemology, our approach relies on access to diverse evidence drawn from interviews with actors, but also from examination of documents, records and other traces. At the same time, building from the ontological assumptions, our protocol does focus on understanding what motivates and what shapes DH researchers&rsquo; work, i.e. it seeks to prioritize objects of our study from the viewpoint of research participants.</p>
<p>As for the axiological level, we advocate for DH researchers (not just meta-researchers) to engage in what Pierre Bourdieu calls  “epistemic reflexivity”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Central to Bourdieu&rsquo;s idea is the notion of two steps back in research: the first step back is to look at the research field itself. In other words, we zoom out, to use <a href="#nicolini2010">Nicolini&rsquo;s (2010)</a> different formulation, to view more clearly the main entities and processes-relations in the field of study. The second step back is to look from the outside at the approach, methods, and instruments of research (i.e., for a DH researcher, to consider the epistemic framework or commitments of their own research, or the research of others DHers). This kind of double objectification is what we suggest through our call for meta-research.</p>
<p>Finally, our methodological plane coheres with the commitments of the study detailed above. We employ our multi-case studies meta-method within a critical realist grounded theory, i.e. we neither adopt the notion that we start tabula rasa seeking to &ldquo;hear&rdquo; the data speak to us, nor do we believe that it is enough to just start with hunches and sensitizing concepts and take it from there.</p>
<p>In some ways our meta-research on DH can be equated to the kind of methodological work that goes on in any community of practice (bioinformatics, for example), or indeed is akin to the work of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK), but there are a few key differences. Primary among them would be the gap in epistemic vocabulary and different levels of methodological coherence between the diverse fields we examine. Unlike the relative coherence of work within specific sciences that was noted in STS/SSK studies, e.g. the existence of coherent epistemic cultures in molecular biology and in high energy physics identified by <a href="#knorrcetina1999">Knorr-Cetina (1999)</a>, humanities disciplines tend to be less coherent methodologically, especially when contrasted with information and computer sciences. In other words, humanities are generally undertheorised in terms of their methods and epistemic strategies, while software development seems at times perhaps overly process-driven in this respect. There is a distinct challenge in bringing these approaches together. In addition, the starting point for this work has not been entirely disinterested: this is an investigation of DH, but also performed — to some extent — by those trained primarily as (digital) humanists, not as social scientists. Because of this, even when we use social science tools and instruments, we may use them differently, drawing on the strengths of what we were taught to do (read texts, looks for patterns, use a peripheral view, be sensitive to subtle, trace indicators of bias or habitus, be unwilling to accept that language use is neutral, focus on cultural norms, values etc). The resulting positioning of our approach to understanding how DH research works, brings certain restrictions on its scalability or universality. While it would be possible for observers of other inter-disciplines and methodological communities to take inspiration from the manner in which we have leveraged our perspective on the work of those in our immediate environment, the specificities of how that would optimally be deployed could be quite different and lie beyond the scope of this paper. That said, our approach would be quite extensible to most DH research and researchers seeking a framework from which to observe their fields.</p>
<p>In what follows, we present a review of previous studies on digital practices in the humanities, before moving on to discuss the steps taken by the Digital Methods and Practices Observatory (DiMPO) Working Group of the Digital Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities in Europe (DARIAH) to develop a protocol for DH meta-research. Included in that section is a critical overview of the notion of meta-research, as it applies to the DH field, and an account of earlier DiMPO work conducted with a meta-research orientation. The pilot studies that follow point to promising directions in the area of DH meta-research and lay the groundwork for the development of our protocol which is presented in the penultimate section of the article. The DiMPO research protocol for DH meta-research consists of a set of specific methodological guidelines for researchers wishing to study research practices in the humanities. It includes: (a) the proposed research workflow (summarized in Figure 3); (b) a conceptual model accounting for both external and internal dimensions of DH activity; (c) a core code system (taxonomy of descriptors) amenable to the qualitative data analysis (QDA), which could be expressed in XML as a SKOS structure if necessary; (d) a qualitative interviewing and document analysis codebook identifying themes for eliciting evidence in situ (elaborated in Table 1); (e) an exemplary case study structure to shape analysis and writing-up. The final section sets forth the next steps for the protocol and the DiMPO working group.</p>
<p>We believe that broader adoption of this protocol by the research community could form the basis for the improved exchange of qualitative research results in this area, and a better understanding of DH and its penetration beyond the scope of those already committed to these methods. In establishing the protocol we hope to illustrate diversity and contextual dependency across different disciplines, schools of thought, typologies of research project and team, and individual practices. Taken together, the article and protocol map out an approach to meta-research of digital practices in the humanities which goes much further than the state of the art, in that it asks us to consider why and how we can comprehensively chart the impact of the digital on our knowledge production practice.</p>
<h2 id="earlier-studies-on-digital-practices-in-the-humanities">Earlier Studies on Digital Practices in the Humanities</h2>
<p>Considerable international research has been conducted on digital scholarship, digital research infrastructures, the organizational and disciplinary structures enabling digital work in the field of humanities research, and the information seeking and use patterns of researchers in the human sciences (for an overview, see <a href="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</a>, <a href="#case2016">Case and Given 2016, 287–96</a>, <a href="#schreibman2016">Schreibman et al., 2016</a>). Within information science, researchers in the subfield of information behaviour have been trying to understand research practice as far back as the 1950s. While this work was initially limited to information seeking – how scholars sought information relevant to their research – it gradually expanded to encompass processes of information management, curation, collaboration and communication <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Information behaviour studies addressed questions of computer use, comparison between the humanities and other disciplines, resource discovery, primary and secondary sources, and finding aids and archival services used by humanities researchers <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One strand of earlier information behaviour research in particular remains relevant today: the abstraction of processes of scholarly information work, such as chaining, browsing and extracting, as described by Ellis in his comparative study across the sciences, social sciences, and the humanities (1993). This comparative approach was enriched with further processes <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, and later converged with the notion of scholarly primitives introduced by <a href="#unsworth2000">John Unsworth (2000)</a>. Carole Palmer and her colleagues further developed the notion of scholarly primitives into a fully-fledged classification of twenty granular, standardised and recombinant scholarly activities, within broader processes of searching, collecting, reading, writing, and collaborating <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. On a parallel trajectory, the work of the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) in the 2000s took the abstraction of the research process further by establishing the complementary notion of computational methods. This led to the development of an extensive taxonomy of methods for the arts and humanities, documenting the context, needs and scenarios of use of each method in particular disciplines – from history, performing arts and archaeology to theatre and linguistics – across complementary contexts of digital data creation, processing and use <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. The AHDS methods taxonomy has been used to structure the ICT Guides database of digital arts and humanities projects in the UK <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> (cf. <a href="#grindley2006a">2006a</a>, <a href="#grindley2006b">2006b</a>), and governed the information architecture of the arts-humanities.net portal, hosted for several years by the Centre for e-Research (CeRch, King&rsquo;s College London). Both the repository and the taxonomy were furthered by the DH@Oxford initiative in the UK, and the Database of Research and Projects in Ireland (DRAPIer, Digital Humanities Observatory).</p>
<p>The Digital Research Tools (DiRT) directory originally appeared under the auspices of the Bamboo project <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, and created a different classification of digital tools for humanities research which, implicitly, reflected an underlying categorization of scholarly research activities. An initiative within DARIAH-DE (the German tier of the DARIAH infrastructure) drew from such earlier work in the pragmatic context of building a tagging scheme for a Zotero bibliography on  “Doing Digital Humanities” <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  to develop an updated Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (TaDiRAH) in collaboration with the DiRT directory <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Echoing Ellis and Unsworth, DH researchers involved in the development of methods taxonomies turned to modular, standardized procedures underlying humanities research enabled by ICT, and usable in hugely diverse contexts. One driving idea was to advocate for the development of  “a system that would span disciplines and facilitate knowledge transfer around digital methods, could help prevent the re-inventing of the wheel, encourage re-use of resources and contribute to a greater awareness of the importance of digital research”   <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In spite of all of this work, however, our knowledge of the information behaviour of humanities researchers in the digital environment remains incomplete, largely due to the fact that this remains a diverse field and has been a moving target, especially as the tools of scholarship have changed radically with the advent of ICT. The complexity and fluidity of the research environment calls for flexible methodologies, capable of capturing the nuances and accounting for the variety of research practices. Hence, the emergence of qualitative inquiry approaches towards DH, which tend to investigate digital practices in a broader epistemic and organizational context, very much in-line with the methodologies presented in the following sections (e.g., <a href="#antonijevic2015">Antonijević 2015</a>).</p>
<p>There are a number of recent studies which either directly or indirectly address digital research practices in the humanities. An important subset of this research has been conducted in the context of defining user requirements for digital research infrastructures and services for the arts and humanities. Questionnaire survey and qualitative interviewing research in the context of the Preparing DARIAH and European Holocaust Research Infrastructure project <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> highlighted, among other findings: the persistent use of traditional, non-digital formats to access textual archival resources and books; the high importance attributed to collecting and managing references, as well as to storing both digital and paper copies of both published and unpublished materials; the perceived value of highlighting relevant text passages and storing notes with them; and the importance of named entities for content-based retrieval of primary and secondary sources. Further analysis of interviews under the same project formally corroborated a number of important intuitions, such as a widespread tendency of researchers to use primary data and secondary sources at the same time, or to forge links between objects on the basis of their conceptual content <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. The Scholarly Research Activity Model, resulting from this work, drew from mixed methods research on the scholarly practices of researchers in the DARIAH and EHRI communities and was used to model, represent and analyse the findings of such analysis <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Some recent work within the DARIAH Community Engagement Working Group (CE-DARIAH) continues to analyse the work practices of humanities researchers and how these researchers might be encouraged to better engage with Research Infrastructures (RIs) such as DARIAH <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Likewise, numerous projects have tackled research on DH from different perspectives. The CENDARI Project (2012-2016) was funded by the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme to pilot the implementation of a virtual research infrastructure for scholars of medieval and modern history. A part of the project dedicated to the Domain Use Cases aimed to capture the different research practices in transnational history, challenges posed by the fragmentation of archival sources, and how a virtual research infrastructure can help address these challenges (CENDARI WP4 team, 2013). The DESIR project (INFRADEV-03-2016-2017; 2017-2019), created a very informative series of video interviews with DH researchers, focusing in part on their own career paths.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  The KPLEX project (2017-2018), funded under the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 research programme, conducted surveys and interviews on how big data research might be better informed by humanities research practices. The most relevant pieces of work for DH meta-research are the interviews of WP2, which looked at computer scientists’ attitudes toward the definitions of certain key terms in their work (especially data), provenance and data cleaning as productive or destructive processes, and the role of uncertainty in humanities research datasets. The protocol used, background information and analysis of the interviews were published as a report.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  The PROVIDEDH Project (CHIST-ERA, 2017-2020) prepared User Stories and Scenarios which present eight cases of how uncertainty arises and is managed in early modern historical research, drawn from interviews with four expert researchers in the field. Finally, The Scholarly Primitives and Renewed Knowledge-Led Exchanges Project <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> was inspired by ethnographic methods, in looking at the practices of knowledge creation in the humanities. Nine interviews were carried out with the aim of pinpointing the key moments and milestones of this process <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. What we can extract from this distillation of almost three decades of research in digitally-enabled humanities scholarship is that any broad framework for study has to be expansive and customizable for a field-specific study. It needs to account for the specificity of the sources, the research team and funding structure, versioning software — in short, the radical instability of the rapidly changing research environment as well as knowledge production itself. Even a cursory examination of how researchers work with digital technology reveals that the application of specific research methods is dependent on the researcher’s ability to use particular digital tools and services (as well as on the stage in research lifecycle, the disciplinary context, etc.). Those studies form the background for the investigation on the scholarly practices, digital needs and attitudes of European researchers in the human sciences which is the focus of the present discussion, and of the meta-research approach that has been developed within DARIAH DiMPO Working Group.</p>
<h2 id="towards-a-protocol-for-dh-meta-research">Towards a Protocol for DH Meta-Research</h2>
<p>The number of studies presented in the previous section brings to the fore how complexity is inherent not only in the human cultural record that is the object of humanistic inquiry but also in the very practices that constitute scholarly work. In the last five years, the work of DiMPO has aimed at studying the purposeful activity of humanities researchers as they engage with everyday processes of scholarly work and to document and account for the role of the digital in their workflows. Its first research endeavour was the European survey on scholarly practices and digital needs in the arts and humanities, disseminated in ten languages during winter 2014/2015, which attracted 2,177 respondents from sixteen European countries. The survey aimed at providing  “an evidence-based outlook of scholarly practices, needs and attitudes of European humanities researchers towards digital resources, methods and tools across space and time”   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The DiMPO survey results depicted a landscape in flux, with rapid change in some places and contexts, and surprising stagnation in others. To capture this changing landscape, the survey was designed as a longitudinal research project, to be repeated every few years. However, while a survey is a good instrument in identifying “what” questions through quantitative summaries and statistical associations between different variables, it provides little context to help elucidate holistically the how and why of DH research. For this reason, DiMPO agreed that a process of qualitative research is also necessary to allow a fuller understanding of how humanities researchers work while engaging increasingly with digital resources, tools and methods. Such a qualitative approach would complement the quantitative while allowing for the interpretations to the multiple intentionalities, disciplinary affiliations and contextual dependencies of particular developments in the field.</p>
<p>Before the next iteration of the survey, DiMPO initially adopted a case-study approach, inspired by a multicase study model <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>it would provide an insight into researcher’s motivations and their reasons for choosing (or refusing) certain digital methods while providing a perspective on the epistemological influence of tools on the research process;  it would be better suited to capture and understand the moment of digital transition in the humanities, especially how earlier methodological or theoretical assumptions are negotiated when adopting digital methods;  it might provide some hints on the evaluation of research work and new methods in DH;  it might shed more light on who are digital humanists, or, more precisely, what it takes for researchers to consider themselves digital humanists;  it accounts for the holistic, contextual and situational dimensions of human culture</p>
<p>Discussions of the rationale and priorities that should govern research on DH research practice led DiMPO to consider a broader epistemic framework for its activities, based on the notion of meta-research. Stemming from concerns on reproducibility and waste in the biomedical field, meta-research emerged recently as an important orientation to the study of research practice. While the term was originally used as a mere synonym to meta-analysis, i.e. the consolidation of aggregated findings of published studies such as different clinical trials on the same research hypothesis, the emerging new field of meta-research now seeks to find evidence-based improvements to scientific work through  “research on research”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> by looking more broadly at  “thematic areas of methods, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives,”  combining theoretical and empirical investigation, and extending beyond retrospective studies to planned, prospective inquiry on scientific practice <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. DiMPO shares the pragmatic goal of meta-research, as it has been adopted in the natural and hard sciences, to make a positive difference in the way researchers work. This commitment underlies the mixed methods research it adopted, consisting of a combination of longitudinal questionnaire survey, literature review, and qualitative multicase study investigations. The scope of DiMPO work, driving the construction of the DiMPO protocol for case study meta-research, is therefore adjusted to studying DH scholarly work by zooming in to a granular study of particular research activities and operations and zooming out to considering broader socio-technical and cultural factors. Beside contribution to knowledge, an important objective of DH meta-research is to assess and help overcome challenges currently faced by humanities researchers in creating, curating and using digital resources, taking up and building useful digital tools and services, and developing and adopting appropriate digital research methods in practice.</p>
<p>During a series of working group meetings in 2017-18, DiMPO planned for harmonization between three pilot studies conducted by different group members and discussed their outcomes, paving the way for the preparation of the final version of the DiMPO protocol. These pilot studies were not designed for the purpose of this meta-research endeavour: they rather represent active, actual research on DH scholarly practices and knowledge work conducted by different co-authors of this study. These span different disciplines and fields within the big tent of DH, from literary studies to history and archaeology, different units for inquiry from individual researchers to research projects and whole fields, and diverse kinds of research questions from digital literacy to the effect of digital tools on research activity to the formation of research communities. Collectively, and through their complementarity and diversity, these pilot studies were selected to satisfy, through the principle of saturation typical of qualitative research, a criterion of generality for our proposed methodology.</p>
<p>Based on input from these pilot studies, a preliminary case study structure was produced, including a common template for outcomes and reporting, instructions on construction of each case study dossier and how it should be situated in the context of multiple case studies. This framework was elaborated according to the particular research needs of the pilot studies. Three studies, presented in brief in the next section, account for three complementary research perspectives adopted by DiMPO, focusing on a different level of unit of inquiry and adopting methodological directions from this orientation: (a)  <em>individual interviews</em>  with Polish DH researchers; (b)  <em>mixed-methods analysis</em>  of digital practice in archaeological research sites or projects, integrating individual interviews, document analysis and naturalistic observation, and, (c)  <em>group interviews</em>  with historians and literary scholars conducted within the framework of NEP4DISSENT COST Action. A secondary dimension, on which the pilots contribute differently, was to balance between a grounded theory, inductive approach based on open coding, and a theory-laden, conceptual model based approach based on practice studies, activity theory etc. Finally, the choice of case-studies was motivated by the need to gather input on digital practices in multiple disciplines (literary studies, history, archaeology), reflecting our broad understanding of the humanities and the big-tent characteristics of DH. In all, a total of twenty-seven researchers were included as study subjects in these pilot studies. The following section briefly contextualises the presentation of the protocol that follows and its main purpose is to give the overview of research questions, methods and possible outputs that can stem out of meta-research.</p>
<h2 id="pilot-study-1-individual-researchers">Pilot Study 1: Individual Researchers</h2>
<p>This pilot study involved Polish humanities scholars and aimed to gain a better understanding of the DiMPO survey results with regard to how digital practices change the work of researchers in various fields, and how these researchers define and understand digital practices in the context of their needs. It was assumed that a series of interviews would provide better information on the values ​​assigned to digital technologies in the context of their use in research, to identify particularly useful existing and missing digital tools, as well as potential obstacles. Other research questions included the influence of digital tools on communication between researchers and disciplines, dissemination of results, the perception of what constitutes research data, and researchers’ assessments of the level of digital competence among their peers.</p>
<p>The pilot study employed a relational approach to digital literacy, which defines the competent use of the digital in terms of a contribution to one’s life quality and performance <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. This relative perspective allows us to view digital competence in relation to other spheres of activity, allowing a subjective assessment of respondents’ competences with regard to their actual needs. In order to fruitfully explore the subject in the relational approach, the research team employed the technique of episodic interviews <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>, as it encourages the exploration of both semantic and episodic dimensions knowledge. The former entails internalised social knowledge, whereas the latter expresses its particular expressions based on specific actions. The method provided insights not only into interviewees’ assumptions on digital research technologies and values ascribed to them, but also into particular manifestations of these assumptions and values in research.</p>
<p>The interview questionnaire consisted of three key sections, each containing up to 9 questions. Section one, aimed at eliciting semantic knowledge, included general questions about the usefulness of digital technologies in research, along with introductory questions identifying the interviewee’s main research interests, career focus and current work situation. Section two concentrated on the episodic knowledge, which regards to the following dimensions: communication within the scientific community, disseminating research results, doing research, academic teaching. The interviewees were very willing to share their experiences with particular devices and software with regard to those dimensions. Section three was dedicated to consolidating and juxtaposing both dimensions of knowledge. The questions focused on the interviewees assessment of their individual digital skills as well as the skills of their scholarly community. This section also assessed the perceived effectiveness of using digital technologies in research in the context of the non-digital practices.</p>
<p>There were five interviewees in total. The subject group consisted of one female and four male researchers, representing different career stages (three professors and two PhDs) and disciplines (two historians and three literary scholars). Two interviewees were leading grant projects at the time of the interview. Three interviews were conducted face-to-face in Warsaw, and two remotely via Skype. Each interview lasted between 45 and 65 minutes. The interviews were recorded, live transcribed and coded  <em>in vivo</em>  by the team members, i.e. new codes were generated inductively from interviewees’ statements by two researchers separately listening to the recordings and taking notes. To decrease the bias, the material was cross-analysed by two researchers. Although this was manageable in the pilot study due to the volume of material (five recordings, 60 minutes each on average), for a full-fledged study full transcription and qualitative coding would be advised.</p>
<p>The study enabled investigators to answer the majority of research questions, and proved effective in eliciting both the general attitudes and experiences concerning the use of digital technology in research, and the experiences and assumptions connected to particular instances of using such technologies on the various stages of the research process. This short discussion of the study outcomes is by no means comprehensive. Two key conclusions from this research were that digital practices enable, facilitate, and in some cases demand the emergence of networks of cooperation within the academia (i.e. researchers from various fields), as well as between academia and other groups (amateur science enthusiasts for instance). Furthermore, digital technologies and practices can help bridge the gap between academic centres and peripheries (although limited access to digital technologies may have a negative impact on this process), as it facilitates cooperation between units, opens access to various resources, and offers state-of-the-art solutions to methodological or theoretical issues.</p>
<p>As for more detailed conclusions, interviewees reported a major qualitative and quantitative change with regard to possible research avenues, quoting perspectives enabled by big data to conduct large-scale comparative studies. Digital research is perceived as more cost- and time-efficient, facilitating the coordination of various elements of the research process. However, the interviewees highlighted the need for the conscious use of the new tools, which may give great opportunities but should always serve as a means for answering the research question, so that the mere use of tools on new material does not become a goal in itself. The writing was reported least affected by digital technologies, as standard, widely available word processors were not replaced in the studied sample by new tools. Interestingly, what was further confirmed in the community research described below, researchers incorporate into their work the non-scientific resources as, for instance, data provided by amateur genealogists or individual enthusiasts. As for the physical working space, interviewees tend to work remotely in different settings (home, university, library), using mostly their own equipment.</p>
<p>In sum, this pilot study informed our thinking about the DiMPO protocol in terms of introducing the methodological orientation of the episodic interview approach, and of defining the research questions and questionnaire construction, and the workflow for the individual interviews.</p>
<h2 id="pilot-study-2-research-projects-and-sites-as-activity-systems">Pilot Study 2: Research Projects and Sites as Activity Systems</h2>
<p>The second pilot study was conducted as part of E-CURATORS, a research project funded by an Insight grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, seeking to advance scholarly knowledge on the growing complexity and diversity of digital research practices in archaeology in the context of increasingly mainstreamed, pervasive, and invisible digital infrastructures. The study looks at practices such as: adoption of mobile devices to capture and document excavation and survey data; use of off-the-shelf mobile apps to construct three-dimensional models of archaeological artefacts, or to geo-locate archaeological information resources; instant online aggregation of captured data and resources in research archives, databases and repositories at the time of capture; use of synchronous and asynchronous communication technologies to connect researchers with data and enable interpretation  “at the trowel’s edge”   <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>; collaborative annotation, enrichment and interpretation of archaeological data using Web 2.0 technologies, crowdsourcing and social tagging; adoption of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) visualization methods and equipment imported from fields such as the media and gaming industries for the generation and assessment of archaeological knowledge; use of blogs, wikis and social media networks to co-create and co-curate archaeological information objects; open access provision of data outside established archaeological data infrastructures; and, the use of gamification, storytelling and social media networks for public communication, learning and mediation.</p>
<p>Inspired by activity theory <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and its application to digital curation <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>, E-CURATORS focuses on studying archaeological research in the situated framework of bounded research processes considered as activity systems, which involve a group of individuals purposefully engaging in specific, hierarchically organized, activities prompted by multiple motivations, pointing to specific goals, and made possible through the affordances of a diversity of norms, established procedures, methods, competencies, as well as digital and conceptual mediating tools. E-CURATORS is thus construed as a multicase study on archaeological projects, organisational units performing situated archaeological work, or sites of archaeological activity. Following a mixed methods approach, for each case study, the project collects a combination of three kinds of research data: (a) audio or video recorded testimonies and stories, acquired through a combination of life history and semi-open episodic interviews, and covering historical (factual), attitudinal and normative dimensions of archaeological activity; (b) documentary evidence, including captured field data, digital photos, models, notes, recordings, logs, database entries, maps, cataloguing texts, reports, web content and publications, and (c), optionally, naturalistic observation of study subjects. While the focus is on the overall activity system constituted by interacting actors, objects and mediating tools, E-CURATORS aims to examine different levels of granularity of scholarly activity through a process of zooming-in to the specifics of digitally-mediated actions and operations, and zooming-out to the contextual factors of sociotechnical infrastructures and epistemic culture <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.</p>
<p>E-CURATORS adopted a multi-step research activity design, based on connecting three interrelated processes: conceptual modeling of digital archaeological practice, data constitution, and analysis and theory building (these were integrated into the DiMPO protocol, which is presented in more detail in Figure 2).</p>
<p>Work in the E-CURATORS project involves frequent iterations between activities, as well as interaction between activities executed in tandem across processes. So far, the E-CURATORS team developed a preliminary, extensible model and code system for QDA, drawing from an earlier model on archaeological digital curation <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>, and based on integration between relevant parts of the NeDiMAH Methods Ontology <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>, and the gIBIS practical argumentation and design rationale schema <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. The model aims to represent evidence not only on (a) activities, actors, their goals and motives, archaeological entities, information resources, methods, procedures, digital devices, tools and services, but also on (b) issues (problems, questions), positions (solutions, ideas), and arguments (criteria, pros and cons) elicited from study subjects on their archaeological practice. A preliminary schematic representation (Figure 1) identifies the functional structure of digital archaeological practice through three overlapping facets, or views: (a) intentionality, relating activities with research actors, beliefs they hold, collectivities they belong to and shared drivers such as motives, goals and norms; (b) process, relating activities with procedures guided by drivers, tools implementing them, and information objects involved in them; and, (c) knowledge work, relating activities with archaeological entities, information objects, and beliefs they support or challenge (Figure 1). The code system consists of extensible code stub hierarchies for all entities in the model, and the relationships between them.</p>

The model represents archaeological activity though actions such as surveying, recording, and classifying, performed by a diversity of actors (e.g., excavators, finds specialists), who hold, establish or adopt claims (positions, arguments) on archaeological questions through knowledge interaction with archaeological entities (artefacts, ecofacts, sites, ancient people, events, cultural meanings etc.) as data and information resources accessed by means of diverse (physical, digital, conceptual) mediating tools (methods, procedures, workflows, recording devices, and analytical software).

<p>Fieldwork on the first case study, the Archaeology Data Service (University of York, UK) and its  <em>Internet Archaeology</em>  journal, was completed in December 2018. Interviews conducted with seven key members of the ADS team are currently being transcribed, coded and annotated using the MAXQDA computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. In tandem, a Neo4J property graph database <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> is being developed to host representations of research data (coded transcripts of interviews, annotated and categorised documentary data), so that they can be visualised and further analyzed through graph browsing, filtering, query, summarization and synthetic views of main activities and ideas expressed by study participants, and related motives, goals, norms and competencies, as well as digital infrastructures and tools, and archaeological entities related to research practices.</p>
<p>An initial evaluation of results from this single-sited case study demonstrates themes and underlying factors, such as shared norms and metaphors about digital preservation work, the nature of the archaeological record, the role of digital repositories such as ADS, and the value of specific knowledges and capabilities, across study participants. Positional roles and relationships between researchers, trans- and interdisciplinary interactions and translations, emerged from interviews with different team members and documentary evidence they pointed us to, and helps build an account of digitally-enabled archaeological activity at ADS that would be impossible without attention to the collective work of study participants within multi-year projects, and to the set of arrangements, presuppositions, methods and norms shared by the ADS team. Individual competencies and orientations play nevertheless as important a role as the broader context of client organisations and people in British archaeology, peer organisations and networks active in archaeological data archiving in the European or global context, and, last but not least, a transdisciplinary ecosystem of diverse platforms, research organisations in computer science and informatics, policy makers and funders whose activities affect, directly or indirectly, the work of the organisation. Sensitizing concepts such as objectual practice <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>, thought collective <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>, and semiosphere <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> seem to be promising in providing fruitful theoretical insights on this study.</p>
<p>The ADS case study raises particular questions regarding the locatedness of archaeological curation practice. ADS activity is predicated upon localised primary archaeological fieldwork, but, by virtue of how communications between archivists and client archaeologists unfold, and how information objects (such as datasets, and archaeological reports) are produced and curated, the ADS work itself detached from the location where it takes place: ADS staff work mostly in front of computer screens, using information systems and services accessible via digital networks, and interact with stakeholders over the phone, email and other digitally-enabled means of communication. Viewed as an archaeological semiosphere <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>, the field where ADS research, curation and data management work is enacted may be conceived as a (conceptual) landscape punctuated by diverse disciplinary traditions, data management methods and rules-of-thumb, norms of best practice and acceptance criteria, competencies and skills, systems and services, and data standards, among other things. While place is not one of the entities represented explicitly in the E-CURATORS schematic model (fig. 1), a topological structure is implicit in its overarching conceptual organisation. Besides, the Neo4J graph database was selected to represent E-CURATORS data exactly because of is ability to allow visualisation, navigation and traversal of topological structures representing curation practices such as found at ADS. Aspects relevant to the ADS case include the emergence of practices of creolisation and translation emerging at the boundary between semiospheres of scholarly archaeology and data management. Other cases of archaeological practice investigated by E-CURATORS, related to digitally-enabled archaeological excavation and survey, may call attention to the boundary between material-tangible and digital-intangible archaeological work, and the processes of creolisation and translation between competing norms, methods and regimes of value among these two semiospheres.</p>
<p>The E-CURATORS pilot is special in being part of a funded project, with an international team of senior collaborators and a dedicated team of paid research assistants, hence some of its characteristics are not transferable to the mostly unfunded, in-kind contribution model under which DiMPO operates. From E-CURATORS, our DiMPO protocol inherits the appreciation of, firstly, the methodological value of zooming-in/zooming-out between different levels of DH research activity, of attention to interactions between different actors in the context of a situated research process - which may be identified as a research site, an organisational unit, or a project - and between research actors and digital resources, tools and methods. Secondly, of attention to the issues, positions and arguments digital humanists identify as they consider challenges and opportunities, and obstacles and drivers to purposeful DH research activity, as well as the importance of norms, motivations and shared orientations within different kinds of  “thought collectives,”  especially as DH changes through interdisciplinarity and osmosis with pervasive digital infrastructures, diverse stakeholders, and bottom-up practices  “in the wild”   <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. And, thirdly, of the shifts introduced by digital tools, services and infrastructures to the spatial enframing of scholarly work, when activities, methods, thought collectives, norms and other elements of scholarly practice collectively form a conceptual rather than physical landscape, a topological structure amenable to traversal and navigation as researchers cross disciplinary and methodological boundaries.</p>
<h2 id="pilot-study-3-research-community-profiles">Pilot Study 3: Research Community Profiles</h2>
<p>This pilot study features our engagement with  “New Exploratory Phrase in Research on East European Cultures of Dissent”  (NEP4DISSENT),<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  a research network of more than two hundred researchers from thirty-seven European countries, funded by the COST Association as a 4-year Action. The Action includes a diverse group of scholars, including historians and art historians, anthropologists and scholars of media studies, librarians/archivists and curators, information technologists and digital humanists.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  One of the main goals of NEP4DISSENT is to introduce DH methods to scholars who are already immersed in digital materials and tools but not yet self-consciously carrying out DH projects. Interviewees were selected who seemed DH-curious and were open to learning new methodologies, but for the most part not yet fluent in DH terminology and major approaches. Therefore, the group interviews conducted at this early stage in the project (March 2018) served several purposes at once: (a) to measure the degree of familiarity with DH tools within the research group, as well as probing attitudes and beliefs about digital tools for research; (b) to provide a snapshot of scholars’ current practices and methods for collecting and curating their data (in some cases born-digital but in most cases analogue); and, (c) to identify the key needs of this group, in terms of areas for possible DH collaboration and training in DH methods within the framework of the Action.</p>
<p>The interview protocol was developed by DiMPO members who are also taking part in NEP4DISSENT under Working Group 5 ( “Mediating Research Through Technology” ), and based on the paradigm developed earlier for the SPARKLE project (discussed in section two above). The eleven selected interviewees, seven male and four female, represented five disciplines: history (6), art history (2), media studies (1), sociology (1), and tourism studies (1). They were interviewed in groups of two to four, over videoconference, with at least two interviewers taking part in each session. At times the subjects interacted with each other during the interviews, but for the most part, the dialogue was one-to-one between interviewer and interviewee. The interviews were coded in vivo by the interviewers and later distilled into a table reflecting key aspects of the study: sources, methods, tools, privacy, publication, barriers, and examples.</p>
<p>The question of barriers to digital research revolved largely around issues of access (digitization priorities of national archives and libraries) and funding, with one respondent pointing to a cultural issue in the region which scholars are sometimes averse to: open-access. Another issue that came up repeatedly was the difficulty of creating datasets that could be easily integrated with those maintained by other scholars – sometimes because of an investment in a single platform from which it is not easy to extract data (or at least not obvious to the researchers using it how to do so). This does not necessarily point to any inherent problem with the platform, as much as to the researcher’s ability to leverage its use and value.  “Working with quantitative data is very time-consuming,”  a historian commented,  “even though there are a lot of tools out of there, but the risk is big because you need to build up your entire data set to accommodate to one tool, and then you realize it’s not the tool you needed (after you cut and pasted for days)”  (Group Interview 3, 2018). These group interviews also revealed a promising line of engagement for NEP4DISSENT to introduce more advanced text analytical methods to those already working with quantitative analysis of written materials, but unsure of how to engage with semantic-level analysis. The main reasons scholars gave for using analogue over digital methods were that: (a) their sources were too mixed, (b) that they lacked faith in digital tools, and, (c) the scale of material collected was so small that they didn’t feel they need for the specific tools discussed or mentioned by colleagues.</p>
<p>A more systematic analysis was performed by applying full qualitative data coding of one of the group interviews. In the context of QDA, coding is defined as a systematic classification process that helps identify themes or patterns, thus forming a basis for the subjective interpretation of a document’s content <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. There are different software options that enable computer-supported content analysis and coding, including MaxQDA, NVivo, Dedoose, and ATLAS.ti. These tools allow investigators to import various kinds of documents, usually in .txt .rtf .doc/x .pdf formats, and to perform different actions that help the content analysis process.</p>
<p>For this in-depth qualitative analysis, data was gathered from the group interview with two researchers working in the area of memory studies, both members of the NEP4Dissent Working Group 4 on Cultural memory of dissent (Group Interview 4). A full transcription of the interview was prepared and QDA was applied to the transcribed text by using the MAXQDA software. The creation of a code system followed an inductive (data-driven) approach by reading and summarizing raw data. The inductive approach uses open coding, where specific codes are derived from data and are subsequently classified in order to create the code system, usually by categorisation aiming to reduce the number of codes by grouping them. An advantage of the inductive approach is that it does not impose any preconceived categories or theoretical perspectives to the ongoing research and allows to gather direct information from study participants, which is grounded in the actual data <sup id="fnref1:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. No in vivo coding was applied during the QDA, meaning that the process of assigning a code mainly involved paraphrasing and generalization of selected text segments rather than verbatim codes. The inductive approach provided useful insights into an analysis based on raw data and helped to identify potential areas of concern expressed by researchers during the interview. Open coding resulted in the emergence of a code system which consisted of six broader definitions (codes) and their subcodes thus presenting the main findings of the interview (see Figure 2).</p>

<p>The findings of the case study showed that the evaluation of one’s familiarity with digital research or the role of the digital was mainly shaped by scholars’ attitudes and beliefs, as well as by personal experience working with digital resources and digital tools:  “(&hellip;) in my case there is a disconnection extent to which I work with digital sources and huge amount of ignorance that I possess about them. So I don’t have proper tools and knowledge on how to work with them. As a cultur[al] historian I see a big need to work with digital sources”  (Group interview 4, 2018).</p>
<p>Questions about digital resources revealed that it’s not only digital publications that are important for research, but even more so online research data, with different websites and social media platforms playing a key role. The Danish researcher admits that social media is a huge incentive for her in finding new ways of studying memory:  “I also haven’t studied the memory of dissent as such, but I was looking into dissenting memories and what you can do with digital sources and social networks, mainly Facebook, and also Youtube. They are places where anyone can contribute and it’s a massive resource for the study of memory”  (Group interview 4, 2018). Meanwhile, the Bulgarian scholar points to the importance of thematic portals for her research, e. g.  “(&hellip;) websites for sharing memories of socialism (&hellip;) is another source which is born-digital, because people go there and they write their comments and memories, but sometimes they upload photos of objects from that period (&hellip;)”  (Group interview 4, 2018).</p>
<p>With regard to questions of digital research methods, scholarly research processes were the most extensively discussed by both scholars, and particular codes were assigned to identify specific activities being mentioned, e. g. seeking of information, acquiring and organizing research data, publishing research results, collaborating with other scholars, and preserving data. In some cases, it’s fascinating to acknowledge how the research process might be ordinary and unformalized:  “(..) we are very honest web users as most other people, the way we engage with net is unprofessional acting like ordinary people with tools that are easy available”  (Group interview 4, 2018). Actually, the simplicity of research activities was observed in every step of research, where research data is usually acquired by copying, pasting or by printscreens and organised by using USB stick, folder system, Powerpoint or Word document:  “(&hellip;) I have a Word file where I copy-paste links that I feel I want to go back [to]. It’s like [a] bibliography, but it’s a linkography - list of links”  (Group interview 4, 2018).</p>
<p>Finally, the key issues identified in the analysis of the group interview were related to open access, lack of digital methods literacy and the complexity of online data. And while the first two perhaps are easy to anticipate, the third issue points to an increasing need to use online data in/for research, as well as methods and tools that could deal with it. As noticed by one of the researchers in the group interview,  “(&hellip;) working with social networks is incredibly tempting and definitely dangerous, because it’s so easy and the feeling is quantifiable (you can count number of likes, comments). What I saw as a challenge in this connection is a super-fluidiness of so much of it, it’s so unstable, so easy, inexpensive, so you don’t know much what is going on”  (Group interview 4, 2018).</p>
<p>This method was also tested in an environment of scholars with a fairly long record in DH, who identified with that field, through an interview conducted with four members of the Stanford Literary Lab,<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  a group representing the field of literary studies, and consisting of scholars on different stages of their careers, with a long history of collaboration. Hence, the interview collected individual responses but also became a platform for negotiating a collective approach towards methods, tools and research strategies adopted by the group. The NEP4DISSENT Group Interview Protocol was slightly modified in this study, allowing for questions inspired by the narrative component of the episodic interviews, discussed in the first pilot study, namely about how the researchers were introduced to digital methods, and how they see the field in the time-perspective (five years ago and five years from now). It should be noted that, as in the case of previous interviews, it was clear for interviewees that the application of digital tools and methods should be always driven by the humanities’ research questions, not the other way around. Moreover, the group tend to seek novel research problems to develop new tools, rather than to use the ones they have already developed on other material. This high methodological awareness also translated into the interviewees’ self-perception as DH scholars. Actually, in their words, being a DH scholar means having two jobs, or writing one and a half dissertation(s), as they need to master two fields: literary studies and computational analysis. They also pointed out to the collaboration model of DH inquiry, which differed largely from individualistic approaches of literary studies. They were also aware of some methodological criticism of DH methods, which they dubbed ‘the rolling backlash’, but claimed it was very productive for their work as it pushed them to rethink certain aspects of their mode.</p>
<p>The working space is an important factor for the project workflow. Although the Lab members often live in different cities and communicate with each other via electronic channels, the actual meeting space remains crucial for debating the current status of the project and exchanging the ideas that may emerge in the first phase dedicated to individual work. The big table in the lab, around which the team gathers for the project meeting, is, in the words of the founding director of the Lab,  “as essential a tool as the really expensive ones &hellip; All researchers bring to this phase their interests, and even fixations. At times, there is a lot of noise. But in a few magic moments, the group becomes truly more than the sum of its parts; it  sees  things that no single pair of eyes could have”   <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>. Hence, the physical space becomes a platform for the integration of the individual perspectives and generation of genuinely collective outputs.</p>
<p>To sum up, this short overview of findings, interviewing DH communities may provide more knowledge about the DH field as such, as well as about overcoming methodological obstacles through collaboration with peers and negotiating DH status in the humanities departments.</p>
<p>Pilot studies on research community profiles contributed to the protocol with regard to establishing the research framework, desk research on actors, conducting group interviews with researchers, as well as transcribing them, coding and analysing.The resulting interpretations will not be designed for DH research as a whole, or even digital history, but rather customized to fit the needs, skills, research environment, and general methodological approaches of our project participants.</p>
<h2 id="the-dimpo-case-study-protocol">The DiMPO Case-Study Protocol</h2>
<p>The outcome of the pilot studies is the DiMPO Case-Study Protocol for Meta-Research in Digital Humanities (Figure 2) and accompanying guidebook (under preparation). These materials are intended to help researchers in conducting meta-research and adopting these guidelines for different purposes, disciplines and approaches. As many of the issues raised here are already covered in manuals for social research, our focus is the specificity of meta-research in the DH environment. This section discusses only the main assumption of the protocol. For a more detailed overview consult the guidebook (under preparation; see Next steps).</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The protocol should serve to bridge knowledge gaps about questions or issues that are relevant, consequential and potentially impactful. The very first step is to define the main area of the case study. As digital humanities tends to be conceived as a  “big tent”  for a plethora of approaches and disciplines (cf. <a href="#svensson2012">Svensson 2012</a>), there are many potential areas for a meaningful work into contemporary research practices, be it the uptake of digital encoding by scholarly editors in literary studies, cultural analytics for art history, or databases in religious studies. The main assumption behind scholarly practices meta-research is that a meaningful change in scholarly practices takes place and is worth investigating. Moreover, as we argued in the introduction, the full assessment of this change should involve not only pioneering computational research, but rather the broader uptake of the digital practices and methods by researchers in the humanities, even if they do not self-identify as digital humanists, as long as they use digital resources, tools and methods in order to explore particular problems. Hence, the investigator should choose the most promising aspect of the field, basing on her own expertise and knowledge.</p>
<p>That leads us to the identification of appropriate research questions. Sometimes, research questions may take the form of well-defined hypotheses, to be confirmed or refuted by operationalizing them as relationships among properties of the data collected in the study (deduction). Alternatively, they may merely consist in identifying relevant aspects of phenomena manifested in the data, which will be later elucidated through inference to the best explanation among alternatives (abduction). Finally, there are cases where the research questions are little more than informal ideas and sensitizing concepts on potential topics of interest, in the expectation that new knowledge will arise from the grounded, bottom-up examination of the data (induction). DH meta-research questions are diverse: for example, they may be how digital resources and tools change the way research questions are formulated and scholarly investigations are conducted, what is the status digital sources in humanities research, or what are the effects of digital collaboration practices and dissemination of knowledge.</p>
<p>On the basis of prior literature and pilot studies, DiMPO identified a number of research questions relevant for DH meta-research, categorized within the following facets: Research Activity, Resource Assets, Tools, Researchers, Place and Time. Facets and research questions are summarised in Table 1.<br>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Another integral part of this early, conceptual stage is the choice of the unit of inquiry. DiMPO protocol distinguishes between three kinds of units, depending on the types of research questions: research community, research project, individual researchers. The focus on  <em>Research Community</em>  enables a view on a particular field, discipline or community of practice, and an assessment of the role the digital in this field. It could also assess the popularity of certain tools and approaches in the community as well as its value judgments concerning the evaluation of the digital work, i.e. what is considered a good practice in the field. The  <em>Research Project/Site</em>  approach allows for a comprehensive and formal description of a particular project, research site, or bounded activity of an organizational unit in its entirety, in order to provide a situated picture and understanding of a particular research endeavour, and the interaction between people, technology and its outputs. The analysis of  <em>Individual Researchers</em>  supplements these approaches with the biographical perspective on a researcher, her individual motivations and goals, particular methods, beliefs held about the digital, and career trajectory. The pilot studies presented earlier are good examples of types of differences in results between particular approaches.</p>
<h2 id="project-framework-establishment">Project framework establishment</h2>
<p>The second step is to establish the framework of the project, i.e. translate research questions into a concrete study workflow. The questions which emerged in the previous step will be now operationalised and particular methods and techniques should be chosen. In the pilots we focused on personal interviews, group interviews and observations, described in more detail in the fieldwork section below. Once the choice is made, a researcher needs to generate the study form, i.e. questionnaires, or observation protocols, relevant to research questions. Additionally an ethics review should be performed and suitable policies applied, especially in cases where there is risk and potential for harm (professional, reputational, etc.) for study participants or investigators. Some funding agencies may require rigorous ethics review, yet, for most of the cases, it involves considering such aspects in clear terms as regards risks, conflicts of interest, preservation of anonymity of study participants, right for withdrawal, obligations for data retention, conditions of access to research data, and consultation with study participants before publication. For instance, one should know beforehand how raw data will be stored, or if it is going to be published in any form. All such cases will be outlined in a consent form prepared for the study, which should be signed by subjects prior to the interview.</p>
<p>Depending on the particular unit of analysis chosen for the study, investigators will need to establish criteria for selection of cases, i.e. which particular individuals, research projects or communities will be approached in this study. They should consider carefully what kind of sampling technique will be relevant to gather heterogeneous material and different approaches.</p>
<p>Finally, the internal work environment should be organised, which entails a selection of tools for data collection, storage and processing, that includes means of recording, transcribing and annotating the communication with the actors, as well as a clear data management plan. The entire framework should be put into a single case-study manual, which can serve as a point of reference throughout the study for the principal investigator and the research team.</p>
<p>Once all of the above items are in place, a short pilot study should be conducted to assess the research design and materials gathered in the case-study manual. Relevant amendments should be made to the manual.</p>
<h2 id="desk-research-on-the-units-of-inquiry">Desk research on the units of inquiry</h2>
<p>The first phase of the actual research consists of gathering data about the unit of inquiry (individual, project, community), which will inform the interaction with actors and allow for the better understanding of their work. Desk research should include a basic case overview, like research scope (what is the field), objectives (what are the aims of research) and contribution (what are the achievements). This includes gathering relevant materials, such as publications, project descriptions, earlier interviews, developed software, etc. The outcome should be presented in a form of short bios of the actors, including descriptions of their projects and contributions, together with a bibliography of publication. Such a resource could be later used by other team members. Materials created in this stage could be later reused in the final report.</p>
<h2 id="fieldwork">Fieldwork</h2>
<p>The next stage consists of the actual fieldwork. Its scope depends on the types of methods chosen and the size of the team conducting the study. One of the easiest ways of acquiring material, often used in our pilot studies, is an interview by videoconference, which is an easy and inexpensive way to reach out to a wider, international base of subjects. But fieldwork may also include participant observation of particular research activities, which could entail attending project meetings and presentations, testing tools developed by actors or observing them at work. This also can entail collection of documentary evidence, such as photos of resources and workplaces, as well as gathering outputs of DH research activity. Such an approach allows for gathering knowledge about the processes which could not be noticed by subjects and not reported in interviews.</p>
<h2 id="data-preparation-and-transcription">Data preparation and transcription</h2>
<p>Fieldwork produces a diversity of raw data, which needs to be put in shape in preparation for analysis. Field notes need to be organized and annotated with the time and place where they were taken; recordings, photos and videos need to be inventoried and may also need to be processed before transcription. Given the scope of DiMPO research, audio (and optionally video) recordings should be transcribed, so as to capture fully and faithfully the verbal content of participant speech, but also salient paralinguistic aspects of speech, as well as relevant non-verbal actions and events. Finally, it includes conventions for describing gestures, pointing at objects and screen events, as these can be important features of observed scholarly practice. CAQDAS packages include useful transcription functions as a matter of course, allowing for slower playback and rewind, pausing, and insertion of timestamps. Transcribers should allow for 6-7 hours of transcription time for each hour of audio recording, or roughly ten person days to transcribe a typical set of audio recordings for each case study. Given the multiple parameters and dimensions of DH research practices to be investigated, the DiMPO protocol stipulates full transcription of audio recordings, rather than open (live) transcription of only the segments that investigators find of interest at first hand.</p>
<p>If anonymization has been decided on as part of the ethics review, visual material may have to be redacted, and names of individuals in text documents and transcripts replaced either with participant codes or, preferably, with pseudonyms (nicknames). But, on the whole, the DiMPO protocol recommends retaining participant identity as an important part not just of ensuring interpretability of results, but also as an ethical commitment to giving due credit to individuals, organizations and projects participating in the study for their frequently innovative practices, methods and ideas.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-and-interpretation">Analysis and interpretation</h2>
<p>The DiMPO protocol recommends that all data collected through fieldwork, as well as in earlier bibliographic and desk research, are imported for analysis into a CAQDAS package such as MAXQDA, Atlas Ti, nVivo or Dedoose, or a free alternative. Segments of transcripts, documents and publications, as well as of visual records collected for the study, can be then annotated systematically and consistently by the use of short jottings and longer analytic memos, i.e., free text annotations capturing the insights, questions and ideas of investigators, and codes. In the context of QDA, a code is defined as  “a word or short phrase that symbolically assigns a summative, salient, essence capturing, and/or evocative attribute for a portion of language-based or visual data”   <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. As soon as research data from preliminary research and fieldwork are ready for analysis, the protocol recommends that investigators immerse themselves in the data, and produce memos which capture initial questions, ideas and insights, as well as associations with sensitizing concepts from the scholarly literature they consider relevant.</p>
<p>During the first cycle of analysis, the DiMPO protocol advocates a combination of deductive (provisional) and inductive (open) coding. A hierarchically-organised provisional code scheme, including ca. 50 initial codes representing the conceptual structure of scholarly practice, will be used to encode transcript and other data segments referring to the compositional structure of DH research activities, their input and output, the roles and involvement of researchers and other stakeholders, the epistemic context of their action, their motives and goals, as well as the digital methods, procedures and tools involved in each activity. In tandem, an inductive coding approach, based on open coding of relevant segments of the qualitative data, can be applied to capture unforeseen aspects of DH work, as well as issues, ideas and arguments introduced by study participants <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The second cycle of analysis is based on theoretical coding, and is performed simultaneously with sorting, filtering, summarization and visualization of data coded according to the inductive/deductive approach described in the previous paragraph. Theoretical codes, i.e., codes that may represent possible explanatory and causal mechanisms, underlying factors and characterizations underlying DH scholarly practice, will be defined through identifying associations, relationships, axial differentiations or shared categorizations of provisional and open codes developed so far, and of the aspects of evidence represented by data segments they are connected with. Intra-case study theoretical coding will be used firstly to make sense of individual cases. This will be followed by theoretical coding across cases, aimed to capture diversity and complementarity between the practices of different DH sites or projects, rather than to achieve confirmation through repetition. Additional fieldwork, e.g., in the form of follow-up interviews to clarify or enrich understanding about some phenomenon that became visible at the stage of theory building, may be planned at this point for the purpose of saturation.</p>
<h2 id="outputs">Outputs</h2>
<p>There are three main outputs of the study: report, data, and additional publications. The genre of a report gives more space for the inclusion of larger chunks of evidence (esp. quotes from interviews) but should also be supplemented by a bibliography of the publications (prepared through desk research) and a glossary of key project concepts, i.e. its theoretical, methodological and technological terms. Ideally, the report should contain the research protocol and codebook, material created through desk research, discussion of the data collected and the interpretation. A report in the field of meta-research should tackle the questions of the role of digital resources, methods, tools, as well as services and infrastructures in the analysed case. Reports could be stored in the DiMPO Community on Zenodo,<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>  or, if applicable, in the DARIAH HAL collection<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>  for better visibility. Additionally, data from the project (esp. annotated transcripts) should be made public whenever it is possible, as it could enable comparative perspectives or reexamination of the material by other investigators (Directory of Open Access Repositories<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>  lists academic repositories around the world).</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-of-the-research-protocol">Evaluation of the research protocol</h2>
<p>The last step of the study is the evaluation of the research protocol, i.e. assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen research framework and methodological choices. This knowledge is extremely important, as it informs further studies in the field, and — as such — should be shared in the report.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>The main goal of this work is to enable comparable meta-research on digital humanities, covering various disciplines. Such a body of knowledge would help in developing a self conscious — if not self critical — approach to the research conducted in the field. Moreover, it could serve as a methodological guideline for non-DH researchers willing to adopt certain methods in their disciplinary work.</p>
<p>The DiMPO team is now elaborating a detailed online handbook to accompany the protocol.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  Future plans include a series of workshops, presentations and tutorials for scholars wishing to conduct such research. Furthermore, DiMPO will be conducting a series of case-studies deploying this protocol. The authors are also considering whether to open the protocol to other topics and uses within the DH community, including such specific fields as scholarly writing practices in DH, or quality assessment. Another avenue for development would be to adapt parts of the protocol for evaluating DH projects and generating detailed reports about their activities, and/or for sharpening the specification of DH development projects.</p>
<p>While local conditions are always the most relevant, scholarly practice increasingly includes conceptual, rather than physical, connectivity because of norms and competencies that are shared across geographic and disciplinary boundaries. These collaborative practices are further enabled by online, mainstreamed and broadly available pervasive digital infrastructures and tools (cf. <a href="#dallas2016">Dallas 2016</a>), which in turn produce new regimes for inter- and cross-disciplinary scholarly work. The only approach that could conceivably handle this variability must take into account research norms, environments (both physical and digital), tools, social formations, and technological limitations which set the parameters — and shape the container — in which each instance of digital research finally takes place. Therefore, we see this paper as a step towards establishing a systematic reflection on the dynamic field of digital humanities, a set of practices which is more often defined and debated than studied, and which always flows to fit the shape of the container in which it is placed.</p>

<p>The digital medium has impacted modes of scholarly communication, as well as research practices including collaboration, knowledge dissemination, and engagement. Over the last few decades, the scholarly landscape has been steadily shifting toward embracing open scholarship, defined as the  “wide and broad dissemination of scholarship by a variety of interconnected means (e.g., technology, licensing) aiming to broaden knowledge and reduce barriers to access to knowledge and information”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Open scholarship comprises open access publications, open educational resources, open data, and open source software, among other things, and provides the foundation for an evolving research culture that privileges broad accessibility and participation by academics and non-academics. Committing to open scholarship practices is an ethical and practical option for scholarly communication and knowledge creation <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, fulfilling the mandate of scholarship to create, share, and disseminate knowledge <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. More efficient workflows and work environments result when practitioners can draw from, borrow, repurpose, and build on already-developed research and data.</p>
<p>Collectively, we consider this embrace of a more public, accessible, and participatory research culture as  <em>open social scholarship</em> . As a concept, open social scholarship has grown from roots in open access and open scholarship movements, the digital humanities’ methodological commons and community of practice <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, contemporary online practices, and citizen scholarship. The Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) Partnership has defined open social scholarship as  “creating and disseminating research and research technologies to a broad, interdisciplinary audience of specialists and non-specialists in ways that are accessible and significant”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Within this conception of the term, open social scholarship manifests in different ways, including by developing, sharing, and implementing research in ways that consider the needs and interests of both academic specialists and communities beyond academia. Open social scholarship also provides opportunities to co-create, interact with, and experience openly available cultural data. Moreover, this type of engagement encourages the exploration, development, and creation of public tools and technologies under open licenses to promote wide access, education, use, and repurposing. Overall, open social scholarship practices enable productive dialogue between academics and non-academics, resisting what is often perceived as a closed circuit of academic knowledge. Refiguring scholarly communication as open access to knowledge enables the public to occupy a more central position in community-engaged university practices; in turn, this has the potential to lead to more democratic and participatory knowledge production.</p>
<p>As the scholarly landscape evolves into a more open plain, so does the shape of institutions, labs, centres, and other places and spaces of research, including those of the digital humanities (DH). Both a theory- and practice-based field, digital humanities (DH) attracts practitioners with a theoretical understanding of knowledge creation, as well as the skills to modify existing forms of knowledge production and dissemination and to create new tools and platforms <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Digital humanists often encourage open social scholarship by using technology to engage with members of the public through projects that involve crowdsourcing or citizen scholarship <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Additionally, DH operates through highly collaborative structures <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> spanning cross-departmental and -campus research, and often extending between collaborators in different universities, countries, or even continents. This, then, grounds open social scholarship in both physical and virtual spaces, harnessing the benefits of both. The coming together of researchers in a physical space allows for the development of shared values and common ground around values of openness, which can then be extended through virtual networks of researchers. The continuing success of such research largely depends on a commitment to these philosophies that broaden opportunities for more efficient, productive, and universal design and use of knowledge.</p>
<p>Consequently, this paper is based on the premise that there is a correlation between the developing knowledge landscape and the structure of an intellectual centre, especially when it is committed to  “open”  values (e.g., open access, source, data, knowledge); the evolution of the knowledge landscape necessarily affects the intellectual structures built upon it. Specifically, we focus on the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL; <a href="https://etcl.uvic.ca/">etcl.uvic.ca</a>) — a collaborative centre for digital and open scholarly practices at the University of Victoria, Canada — and demonstrate how the lab’s  “intellectual space”  has shifted to espouse open social scholarship in research, skills training, and community-oriented initiatives in response to a changing knowledge landscape. The ETCL’s “intellectual space” is based in the physical lab but operates through in-person and virtual collaborations across different initiatives and projects. Within this intellectual space, we engage with intersecting areas of new media, digital humanities, open access, and digital publishing. Leading scholarly communication researcher Kathleen Fitzpatrick (2019) contextualizes these many threads within a framework of public engagement, calling for a shift in mindset toward what she calls  “generous thinking” :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By finding ways to connect with readers and writers beyond our usual circles of experts, in a range of different registers, and in ways that move beyond enabling  <em>them</em>  to listen to  <em>us</em>  to instead allow for meaningful dialogue and collaboration, we can create the possibilities for far more substantial public participation in and engagement with a wide range of kinds of academic work. We can build programs and networks and platforms that do not just bring the university to the world, but also involve the world in the university. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Fitzpatrick, the evolution of the university must include more purposeful connection between academics and the public they serve. The ETCL is attempting to make such connections with its local and global communities — acknowledging that perspectives on research and its engagement, like the important relationships that bring us together in collaboration with others, change over time. To this end, we have adopted a versatile lab structure and infrastructure: today in support of open social scholarship in the many branches of the ETCL, but previously in support of research-related antecedents to this current focus.</p>
<p>In what follows, we will situate the ETCL in the current knowledge landscape alongside other digital scholarship centres to explore the various roles these units occupy with respect to the communities they serve, focusing on the larger cultural change toward more open, accessible, and inclusive practices. The second part of this paper will address how the ETCL’s intellectual space and infrastructure model has shifted to espouse open scholarship across its research, teaching, and service aims by launching the Canadian Social Knowledge Institute (C-SKI), the umbrella organization that facilitates the ETCL itself, as well as the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) and Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE). Overall, we aim to demonstrate how the place and space of a research lab can engage communities more widely with publicly funded humanities output, including through research creation and dissemination, mentorship, and skills training.</p>
<h2 id="i-lab-infrastructure-and-the-evolving-knowledge-landscape">I. Lab infrastructure and the evolving knowledge landscape</h2>
<p>Humanities scholars have been experimenting with computational modes of inquiry for decades now. But in the early 2000s, this activity became formalized under the banner of  “digital humanities.”  As Matthew Kirschenbaum remarks in his foundational article  “What Is Digital Humanities and What Is It Doing in English Departments?,”  the 2001 debate over the naming of an anthology —  <em>A Companion to Digital Humanities</em>  (2004), co-edited by Ray Siemens, Susan Schreibman, and John Unsworth — is often considered to be the point when the digital humanities was officially named as such <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Founded in 2004 by Siemens, the ETCL was an early-established DH lab. Currently led by Ray Siemens as Director, Alyssa Arbuckle as Associate Director, Randa El Khatib as Assistant Director (Open Knowledge Initiatives), Luis Meneses as Assistant Director (Technical Development), and Jannaya Friggstad Jensen as Assistant Director (Coordination and Operations), the lab serves as an intellectual centre for the activities of about 40 local faculty, staff, students, visiting scholars, and community members, and more than 150 since inception. Through a series of highly collaborative relationships, the ETCL’s international community comprises more than 300 researchers and more than 50 collaborative partners.</p>
<p>The ETCL was initially modeled on the structure of successful university-based science research labs, adapted for DH researchers. In 2012, Lynne Siemens and Ray Siemens outlined a number of research lab models in  “Notes from the Collaboratory,”  a presentation at the annual international Digital Humanities conference. In this piece, Siemens and Siemens generally divide collaborative research modes into collaboratories and faculty-directed laboratories. Collaboratories, also known as  “centres without walls,”  are shared spaces for researchers who create, contribute to, and draw from common resources such as databases and supercomputers within an overarching research area, although their direct research projects may be different <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Other models for collaboration include those of a multiple-researcher directed  “co-laboratory”  and single-researcher director  “collaborat-ory,”  both of which are adaptable to a humanities context <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. The ETCL’s current structure is an expansion of the faculty-directed laboratory, where the lab’s overall success is measured through outputs that meet  “standard academic and funding agency benchmarks that [include] measurable research resource intake, provision of teaching and service, and research outputs, such as books, articles, conference papers, and other types of production, more DH-oriented research outputs in the form of tools and prototype development, and further issues”   <sup id="fnref2:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Although still relying on the faculty-directed structure outlined in 2012, the ETCL has significantly expanded its team and operational model since that time; it currently operates under the leadership of the director and directorial team who all produce academically measurable outputs, in part as a means to reach formal targets tied to grant funding and ongoing use of research space <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. These measurable outputs are integral to the continuous operation of a lab <sup id="fnref3:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Our shared thinking about the lab, what our roles and functions are, and how that is manifest in our structure and operation are quite conscious and deliberate — as are, for us, the contexts in which we work. Aligned with Vivian Lewis, Lisa Spiro, Xuemao Wang, and Jon E. Cawthorne in their report  <em>Building Expertise to Support Digital Scholarship: A Global Perspective</em>  (2015), we agree that digital scholarship is  “thriving”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> and have noted that the landscape of scholarship has changed dramatically in just a few years, encompassing a new set of methodologies, tools, and research materials that enable researchers to ask new types of questions but also require new sets of skills <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. We have seen ourselves situated in this milieu from the start — as a type of digital scholarship centre essential in this new scholarly landscape because we offer space, both physical and social, for collaboration and access to technology and technological expertise that is often not available elsewhere on campus.</p>
<p>We have noted that digital scholarship centres take different forms at different institutions, but generally speaking, a common function regardless of size and scope is to be a hub for digital scholarship that facilitates and provides both physical and virtual space for collaboration, access to tools and resources, and services for researchers broadly defined, including students, faculty, and staff from across campus and citizen scholars from the local community. Discussion about digital scholarship centres within the academic community tends to focus on the role of institutional libraries in establishing centres and supporting digital scholarship (see <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>). Libraries are uniquely appropriate sites for digital scholarship centres because they serve all departments and faculties, making them a central hub for research within an institution and a neutral space for interdisciplinary collaboration <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. In addition, academic libraries are already innovators in digital scholarship, and librarians have expertise to collaborate with researchers and support digital scholarship projects. Rebecca Dowson notes, for example, that Simon Fraser University Libraries’ Research Commons model developed in response to changes in the scholarly landscape, supporting digital scholarship just as the Information Commons model supports the transition from print to digital research resources and the Learning Commons model supports learning and academic communication (2016). Dowson points out that, although Research Commons support different kinds and stages of research creation, and are therefore not necessarily sites of digital scholarship,  “the two concepts share a number of core values, including an ethos of openness, interdisciplinarity, collaboration, and focus on knowledge creation and new modes of production”   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Each digital scholarship centre is designed to meet the needs of its own research community, so they vary in size, structure, and function <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. For example, the ETCL is situated in the Digital Scholarship Commons of the McPherson Library at the University of Victoria. The Digital Scholarship Commons is a space for community training in digital tools and methodologies, interdisciplinary work, and presentations; it also houses the Humanities Computing and Media Centre — a space supported by the Faculty of Humanities in which software developers and experts in research and instructional design provide service and support for faculty members and their projects. Many times, lab, centre, and commons all denote the same thing, and, at times, the choice of one over the other is made because of local preferences or issues such as administratively-controlled vocabularies.</p>
<p>Although there is no standard nomenclature for digital scholarship centres, they can generally be categorized in two ways: commons-type centres and lab- or makerspace-type centres. Commons-type centres tend to be service-driven, providing access to shared resources much like the collaboratory model described above, and serving the entire institutional community and often the local community as well <sup id="fnref4:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Many have stronger relationships with the social sciences and humanities research communities than with other disciplines, possibly because similar resources for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines are available elsewhere on campus <sup id="fnref2:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. In contrast, digital scholarship labs and makerspaces are generally open to a specific group of researchers only and may focus on DH specifically, although, like the ETCL, they often engage with the associated researchers from across the university and the local community as well. Lab-type centres tend to be research-driven, aligning them with the faculty-directed  “co-laboratory”  and  “collaborat-ory”  models discussed above, although many — again, like the ETCL — also embrace some service and teaching functions related to their research mandates. Some educational programming is common across all types of digital scholarship centres, including workshops and other training programs and talks by in-house or visiting speakers. Many centres also provide access to technologies that are otherwise difficult for their community to access, such as 3D printing equipment and software, virtual reality technology, specialized software and, importantly, training and technological support. Typical services offered by commons-type centres to the entire university community, for example, include consultation, data preservation, support for digital scholarly communication, and metadata creation and management <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Studies about digital scholarship centres tend to emphasize their innovative nature and the vibrancy of their communities. While most such studies to date have a US or global focus (see, for example, <sup id="fnref3:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref2:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>), similar innovations are evident in the Canadian context, and the number of Canadian digital scholarship centres continues to increase. The digital scholarship ecosystem in Canada is complex, comprising numerous centres uniquely designed to meet the needs of their particular institutional community. Regardless of their idiosyncrasies, these centres can be broadly categorized as either commons-type or lab-type.</p>
<p>Many of the commons-type centres are located within the university library and are open to the entire university community. They offer collaborative learning spaces, pedagogical support, research collaboration and consultation, workshops, events, and scholarly communication support, including for open scholarship. Examples of these centres in Canada include the Digital Scholarship Lab at Brock University, Lab NEXT at the University of Calgary,<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  the Innovation Commons at McGill University, the Centre for Digital Scholarship at the University of New Brunswick, and the Digital Scholarship Commons at the University of Victoria (the larger group of which the ETCL is a part). York University’s Digital Scholarship Centre appears unique insofar as it is open to the entire university community, but is located within the library serving students and researchers in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Fine Arts, and Environmental Studies. In its focus on a particular research community within the university, York’s centre is like many other commons-type digital scholarship centres that are located in the university library but open to specific groups of researchers, particularly graduate students, postgraduate researchers, and faculty. This type of centre offers many of the same services and programming as those described above, but is geared toward supporting research and publication — including open forms of publication — rather than undergraduate learning, although most welcome undergraduate students who are part of a faculty-led project. Some examples of these research-focused commons-type centres include the Lewis &amp; Ruth Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship at McMaster University, the Digital Research Centre at the University of Saskatchewan, the Research Commons at Simon Fraser University, UBC’s Advanced Research Computing, the Humanities Computing and Media Centre at the University of Victoria, the University of Windsor’s Centre for Digital Scholarship, and the University of Guelph’s Digital Scholarship support program, which — unlike the other centres — is a cluster of services based in the library rather than a physical space within it. Brock University has a second digital scholarship centre — the Centre for Digital Humanities — that offers many similar services to its Digital Scholarship Lab, but outside of the library and for students in specific Humanities programs only.</p>
<p>Similar to commons-type digital scholarship centres, lab- and maker-space type centres tend to be highly collaborative and interdisciplinary. Although they are generally faculty-led and research oriented, most also offer talks, workshops, and other programming open to the university community. The ETCL and the Centre for Digital Humanities at Ryerson University are examples of labs with interests in teaching and training, as well as open scholarship. Some are located within university libraries and learning centres, such as the ETCL, the University of Alberta’s Canadian Institute for Research in Computing and the Arts (CIRCA), and the Digital Humanities Innovation Lab (DHIL) at Simon Fraser University, while others are not. Many focus on specific themes or clusters of themes, or otherwise target specific community needs. The Centre de recherche interuniversitaire sur les humanités numériques (CRIHN) at the University of Montréal, for example, brings together digital humanities researchers from several universities in Québec, while Western University’s Cultureplex Lab enables collaboration between humanities scholars, entrepreneurs, computer scientists, and engineers. Other examples of lab-type digital humanities centres in Canada include the University of British Columbia’s Emerging Media Lab (EML), the AMP Lab at UBC Okanagan, Carleton University’s Hyperlab, the University of Ottawa’s Humanities + Data Lab, and the MeTA Digital Humanities lab at Vancouver Island University. As this brief survey reveals, each of these digital scholarship centres is unique in structure and focus; they all, however, emphasize interdisciplinarity and collaboration within the Canadian research context.</p>
<p>In this vital and thriving context of digital scholarship in Canada, and especially in consideration of ETCL’s move to the UVic Digital Scholarship Commons in January 2017, it is important to note that ETCL has expanded in size and scope as part of its evolution over time. Although we still undertake many digital humanities projects and initiatives — most notably by facilitating the annual Digital Humanities Summer Institute — many ETCL constituents are now active in open social scholarship through theoretical and practical engagements, as described in the following section. The ETCL is not the only digital humanities group to shift focus toward more open and more social practices. In fact, this movement could be considered as emblematic of a larger cultural change in the field. Among other venues, this shift is emphasized in the thematic community focus of representative collections like  <em>Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities</em>   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>,  <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em>   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>,  <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016</em>   <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, as well as  <em>Doing Digital Humanities</em>   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> and  <em>Doing More Digital Humanities</em>   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> that have emanated from the DHSI community. Most notably in these collections, see Brennan (2016) and Hsu (2016) on public humanities; Brown (2016) on collaborative knowledge production; Gil and Ortega (2016) and Liu (2012) on the necessity of racial diversification; Hockey (2012) on cross-community collaboration; Losh (2012) on the role of activism; McPherson (2012) on inequality; Wernimont and Losh (2016) on the need for intersectional feminism; and Williams (2012) on the value of accessibility. Many digital humanities practitioners are reconsidering their role in local, national, and international contexts that extend beyond the academic world. Such a disciplinary turn toward matters of social justice, collaboration, and social media acknowledges a changing tide of consciousness around how the humanities is constituted as an academic field, as well as what its role is (or could be) in the larger social sphere.</p>
<h2 id="ii-lab-practices-that-engage-open-social-scholarship-across-research-teaching-and-service">II. Lab practices that engage open social scholarship across research, teaching, and service</h2>
<p>Recognizing our community’s distinct momentum toward open social scholarship, the ETCL and INKE launched the Canadian Social Knowledge Institute (C-SKI; <a href="https://inke.ca/projects/canadian-social-knowledge-institute/">https://inke.ca/projects/canadian-social-knowledge-institute/</a>) in 2015. C-SKI helps coordinate and support INKE-related and other open social scholarship activities across our three major initiatives: the ETCL itself, the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI; dhsi.org), and the INKE Partnership (inke.ca), including sub-projects associated with each. Through research creation and dissemination in open venues, mentorship, and skills training, C-SKI seeks ways to engage communities more widely with publicly funded humanities output.</p>
<p>Once the C-SKI structure was in place, we held a visioning meeting in spring 2018 with select current and past members in order to reflect formally on the developments and infrastructural changes of the ETCL and to plan the lab’s next steps. In addition to our thinking about how the intellectual space of the ETCL is interconnected, the outcome of this exercise was to reflect our shifting direction by updating the ETCL mandate, mission, and values statements. Our ETCL mandate is to be  “a collaborative centre for digital and open scholarly practices. We are a multidisciplinary team of faculty, staff, students, and visiting scholars who engage on- and off-campus partners through research, skills training, and community-oriented initiatives”   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Our mission is to engage, facilitate, and promote cross-community digital initiatives at the University of Victoria, as well as in the larger regional, national, and international contexts by cultivating the practices and values of open social scholarship <sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. These tie into our values — namely our dedication to community-driven scholarship that recognizes collaborative models of knowledge sharing; open practices in digital research, production, and dissemination; the intellectual development and well-being of our communities; shared mentorship, accountability, and support across multiple disciplines, professions, and groups; and inclusive and ethical practices, as outlined in the DHSI Statement on Ethics and Inclusion (see <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>) <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. These values reflect the ETCL’s main direction over the last few years: to understand and practice open social scholarship.</p>
<p>Another goal of the ETCL visioning meeting was to propose various infrastructural models that may best describe how C-SKI transfuses its open social scholarship mandate to other aspects of the lab. Two models that seemed particularly relevant were  “lab as incubator”  and  “lab as tree.”  Not to be confused with  “academic incubator,”  which typically refers to an informal space to develop partnerships between students / the university and non-university / industry-based representatives or investors with the goal of facilitating entrepreneurship <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>, the  “lab as incubator”  reflects the ETCL’s goal of developing and sustaining an environment that cultivates open social scholarship. The incubator metaphor also reflects the idea that a lab should be a positive space for growth — in our case, one that has facilitated ETCL, DHSI, and INKE to develop into their current forms, and also to embrace a larger frame of collaborative research with others as they move toward open social and scholarship themselves. The second model,  “lab as tree,”  represents something living and growing that serves as a foundation and support for new growth. A tree also depends on communication between all of its constituent parts, and more accurately reflects the sub-branches that grow out of the separate branches. As early as the 13th century, trees have been employed as metaphors for structuring and categorizing knowledge, such as in Ramon Llull’s structuring of the sciences in  <em>Arbor Scientiae</em>  (1295), or Tree of Science <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> (figure 1).</p>

<p>The tree metaphor for organization and categorization has been widely employed as a strategy to aid thinking and categorization in numerous disciplines, especially the sciences, in fields like biology <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>, and is often used in computing <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. Additionally, the tree metaphor at once reflects the deep, 16-year roots of the ETCL at both the University of Victoria and in the DH community. In either representation, as an incubator or the trunk of a tree, the lab is a foundational element that supports the whole. By extending this metaphor of  “lab as tree,”  the rest of this article will follow the main branches of the Canadian Social Knowledge Institute, the goals of each, and the ways that they intersect.</p>
<h2 id="1-first-branch-electronic-textual-cultures-lab-etcl">1. First Branch: Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL)</h2>
<p>The ETCL is the research-intensive component of the tree, and houses multiple graduate research assistants, postdoctoral fellows, and a number of staff members, and is also open to the rest of the university and the public through directed practicums and fellowships.</p>
<p>According to Amy Earhart (2015), DH labs resemble science labs in that they  “contain equipment utilized by digital humanists, emphasize collaborative research, and focus on theoretical and applied research” ; however, they also train and mentor students and faculty,  “serving as pedagogical and outreach or service arms dedicated to growing work within the field”  — tasks that are typically carried out by separate bodies in the sciences <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. Another difference between science and DH labs that applies to the ETCL is the different layout of the two:  “[w]hile science labs are often clustered by area, equipment or topic, digital humanities labs are often broader, multipurpose, and more inclusive by both design and funding limitations”   <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. The ETCL’s intellectual space operates in both physical place and virtual space. The physical place is grounded in the ETCL and its associated programs, which are described below. The physical layout of the ETCL comprises a large room with multiple workstations and meeting spaces. The open setup promotes collaboration, as do the meeting spaces that are used for ETCL team members and partners beyond the lab. Equipment, such as 3D printers, scanners, and software can be used by everyone working in the lab. There is also a lab library that includes many print texts on digital humanities, digital scholarship, publishing, and open scholarship, among other topics including many in the traditional, historical humanities. Based in the physical place, the virtual space comprises a network of associated researchers and communities beyond the lab. ETCL members have confirmed that despite the growth of virtual tools (such as Skype, listservs, emails, project coordination websites, etc.), face-to-face interactions in a physical space remain important <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. By meeting in this context, the network of ETCL members and affiliates develop common ground and shared values. Having shared values means that we can more easily communicate with each other and be more connected as a network able to support mutual goals related to open social scholarship <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The lab itself can be thought of as  “the place where it all happens,”  since it is the physical place in which we cultivate the ETCL’s intellectual space, organize DHSI, and develop the research infrastructure that supports a significant portion of INKE’s intellectual direction and activity; these are discussed as separate branches below. Beyond coordinating DHSI and INKE, the lab also supports multiple projects of its own and largely functions as a mechanism for community building across and beyond campus. In part this occurs through multiple speaker series — including the Nuts and Bolts discussions designed to focus on the pragmatics of digital research and the Digital Scholarship on Tap interdisciplinary lecture series that brings together researchers to share their different disciplinary perspectives on a common topic (e.g., digital mapping), each evolving out of years of earlier, less formal presentations about ongoing research that typically took place mid-day and to which people brought their packed lunches and ate while they listened and discussed. Through these collegial talks and discussions, the lab builds a community around developments in digital scholarship, research, and teaching in an increasingly digitized world. The ETCL also supports activities in open social scholarship through the Open Knowledge Program, through which it opens up the physical place of the lab for fellows across campus, and from the local and global communities. In what follows we discuss the Open Knowledge Program and how it relates to or embodies the ETCL’s open social scholarship ethos.</p>
<h2 id="11-open-knowledge-program">1.1 Open Knowledge Program</h2>
<p>In the last few decades, academic institutions have witnessed a recurring call to engage the public more actively. Engagement is considered both in terms of opening the space of the institution and in reorienting its focus towards more public-facing scholarship, culminating in the rise of the public humanities <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. More recently, this call has been answered by projects that draw on citizen scholarship, citizen science, and other forms of community-engaged scholarship, made easier with the development of more user-friendly and accessible technologies <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. We see this shift toward more publicly-engaged scholarship as an opportunity to open up the physical place of the ETCL to university and community members and to expand the dissemination of lab-related research through more public-facing scholarly communication channels. One of the ways the lab embraces this shift is through the Open Knowledge Program (<a href="https://etcl.uvic.ca/okp/">https://etcl.uvic.ca/okp/</a>), launched in 2017 from earlier informal origins, which comprises a suite of activities that include the Open Knowledge Practicum, the Open Knowledge Practicum@DHSI, and the Open Knowledge Residency.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p>
<p>The Open Knowledge Practicum invites non-lab affiliates from the local on- and off-campus community in the Greater Victoria Region to bring their own public-facing project interests and research into the lab. As of spring 2020, the practicum is in its fourth year, and consists of four-month fellowships, although fellows may choose to extend their practicum for more than one term. The lab’s role is to provide support, consultation, and mentorship and to strategize research plans with fellows. As part of the practicum, fellows are also offered honorariums, often in the form of DHSI tuition scholarships that provide training in technical and theoretical areas necessary to fellows’ projects. Fellows contribute to Wikipedia and publish their projects in online, public venues, and are also involved in the day-to-day lab life and events on and off campus. Recently, the Open Knowledge Practicum has expanded to support faculty partnerships, where the ETCL houses larger projects and their lead investigators in the lab, while providing support, training, and mentorship to the student researchers working on that project through fellowship positions.</p>
<p>The Open Knowledge Practicum@DHSI is a highly focused version of the practicum that runs annually over the three days preceding DHSI, and is open to DHSI attendees and instructors. During the practicum, fellows develop a well-defined project related to their work, with the goal of sharing the project in a public venue such as Wikipedia. Honorariums for this fellowship constitute accommodation and per diems, meant to support those travelling to Victoria for the additional stretch preceding DHSI.</p>
<p>The third and most recent addition to the program is the Open Knowledge Residency, a one-week intensive residency open to MA and PhD students in any discipline at UVic to develop an aspect of their thesis, dissertation, or any other formal project, with the support of the ETCL’s community and resources. Like other programs in this stream, residents will contribute some aspect of their project to an online, public venue, and will more generally be exposed to the value of making scholarship accessible. The residency is also meant to give graduate students a more formal experience of working in a DH lab and help them develop digital skills by offering two DHSI spots for each residency; together, these skills are meant to help graduate students complete their projects but also help them develop experience and transferable research skills in preparation for the job market. With nearly 40 participants from the Open Knowledge Program in the three years since its inception, and cohorts increasing steadily, the ETCL is conscious about trying to keep the physical place of the lab open and making research more broadly accessible to the public.</p>
<h2 id="2-second-branch-digital-humanities-summer-institute-dhsi">2. Second Branch: Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI)</h2>
<p>A global community is also involved in the  “place”  of the lab annually at DHSI by spending up to two weeks on campus for the duration of the institute. DHSI is a productive environment for acquiring and developing digital humanities skills via knowledge transfer, networking, collaboration, and community building. Launched in 2001, DHSI offers the largest digital humanities curriculum in the world. It originated at Malaspina University-College (now Vancouver Island University) as a collection of early-career scholars who wished to build a supportive community of practice around computational applications in the arts and humanities; it was supported there by the Centre for Digital Humanities Innovation, a predecessor of ETCL. Moving to the University of Victoria in 2004 when the ETCL was established there, DHSI grew from its roots as an informal event (which we might today call an unconference) that initially drew some 20–30 people to, by 2019, a formal institute with an annual planning and operation cycle drawing some 850+ participants, with an involved international collegiate of approximately 4,500 alumni. Since we were unable to hold an in-person DHSI in 2020 due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the workshops and featured speakers originally scheduled for DHSI 2020 were postponed to 2021. However, in lieu of the in-person gathering, we hosted our first ever virtual institute, DHSI 2020 — Online Edition, that moved several affiliated events online, including the DHSI Conference and Colloquium and Alliance of Digital Humanities (ADHO) Special Interest Group for DH Pedagogy and Training mini-conference, the Project Management in the Humanities conference, the RTL (Right to Left) workshop, and an EPoetry event #GraphPoem [<a href="https://dhsi.org/dhsi-2020/">DHSI 2020 — Online Edition</a>]. The event took place in the first two weeks of June and brought together over 1200 participants from around the world. Similarly, in 2016 we worked with the Electronic Literature Organization (ELO) to host its annual international conference with DHSI, in 2017 with the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing (SHARP) for its annual international conference, and in 2018 with the Council on Library and Information Resources’ Digital Library Federation (CLIR DLF) as well as the Symposium for Indigenous New Media.</p>
<p>In this way, DHSI is more than course-based training alone; rather, it offers a recognized intermediary space for scholars, researchers, and students to connect with colleagues from other disciplines and professions in and around the digital humanities. Through a mix of courses, workshops, colloquiums, conference activities, and networking events, participants meet to share their research, interests, and expertise across traditionally divergent lines of knowledge creation. DHSI’s participants include those on the academic track seeking skills training and professionalization opportunities, but they also readily come from outside the university setting, such as those involved with cultural heritage activities, working for the government or in the private sector, or simply curious non-academic researchers or citizen scholars who want to acquire new skills and learn about the work of our community.</p>
<p>A key point in DHSI’s commitment to openness and open social scholarship, which exists on a number of levels, is that we welcome those who wish to participate, from all backgrounds and interests. Many attendees are awarded significant tuition scholarships to offset the cost of participating in the institute. At times upward of 30% (~300) of attendees receive tuition scholarships from DHSI or assistance from related external sponsorship. In this way, we can offer opportunities that might not exist otherwise and support participants by providing tangible means to help them attend and participate in the institute. We also encourage course proposals from members of our community; called  “community courses,”  these offerings are intended to align with current interests, passions, and areas of expertise among those in our group. Further, in its intellectual direction, since 2017 DHSI has brought open scholarship into a pedagogical setting by offering a number of courses that engage open scholarship and open knowledge.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>
<p>We also offer DHSI events at other points of the year aside from its summer offering. For the sixth time, in January 2020 we hosted DHSI events at the annual Modern Language Association (MLA) convention. The first workshop,  “DH Curious? Digital Humanities Tools and Technologies for Students, Emerging Scholars, Faculty, Librarians, and Administrators,”  offered novices in DH a broad overview of theoretical and hands-on branches of DH tools, methodologies, and pedagogical engagements. The workshop attracted a broad audience including graduate students, faculty, librarians, and administrators from different disciplinary backgrounds. In 2020 we also offered a new workshop,  “Digital Humanities and Open Scholarship: An Introduction,”  which focused on open access tools, open scholarship policy, open annotation, and Wikipedia. Similar training is offered at the annual Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences as well. Through these skills training initiatives and the active online DHSI community on platforms such as Twitter and the DHSI listserv, DHSI continues to foster local and global communities throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id="3-third-branch-implementing-new-knowledge-environments-inke">3. Third Branch: Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE)</h2>
<p>Initially funded by the SSHRC Major Collaborative Research Initiatives Program, INKE officially began in 2008 as a seven-year interdisciplinary initiative spawned in the methodological commons of the digital humanities. INKE’s goal at that time was to understand the future of reading and the book through a historical perspective aligned with the current and emerging tools and techniques of scholarly communication. For this work, INKE brought together  “researchers and stakeholders at the forefront of computing in the humanities, text analysis, information studies, usability and interface design into a network comprised of those who are best-poised to understand the nature of the human record as it intersects with the computer”   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. INKE’s focus on electronic text during those first seven years reflected the wider interests of the digital humanities at large, as evident in field-defining collections from the same era (e.g.,  <em>A Companion to Digital Literary Studies</em>   <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>;  <em>Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities</em>   <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>;  <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em>   <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Over time, this focus has evolved with pertinent movements in the fields that inform our work. The INKE Partnership was recently awarded a 7-year SSHRC Partnership grant to support the collaborative work of its community of researchers, librarians, and other partners who are involved in implementing proactive strategies and solutions that will realize robust, inclusive, participatory, and publicly engaged digital scholarship:  <em>open social scholarship</em> . The international INKE Partnership consists of 35 researchers across 20 institutions and 21 partner agencies, with work involving some 19 postdoctoral research fellows and 53 graduate research assistants since inception. Closely aligned to and affiliated with the INKE Partnership is the Canadian-Australian Partnership for Open Scholarship (CAPOS), a collaboration between Canadian and Australian researchers, policy makers, libraries, computing organizations, research groups, and postsecondary institutions [<a href="https://inke.ca/projects/canadian-australian-partnership-for-open-scholarship/">CAPOS</a>]. Building upon the open scholarship research and development interests of its community, the INKE Partnership seeks to advance understanding of and resolve crucial issues in the production, distribution, and widespread engagement of digital scholarship.</p>
<p>The INKE Partnership interest in open social scholarship has intellectual forbears in related areas including open access, public humanities, scholarly communication, and citizen science. In order to explore the possibilities of such a shift, the INKE Partnership generates accessible research and research technologies for a broad audience of specialists and active non-specialists. INKE also discovers and shares the most effective ways to create, translate, and share knowledge with research, administration, policy, and other communities, and disseminates this knowledge through the in-progress Open Scholarship Policy Observatory. In addition, through the in-development Canadian Humanities and Social Sciences Commons, INKE employs approaches that foster and encourage openness by collaborating on innovative and inclusive open social scholarship projects and initiatives.</p>
<h2 id="31-open-scholarship-policy-observatory">3.1 Open Scholarship Policy Observatory</h2>
<p>The Open Scholarship Policy Observatory (first prototyped in 2017) is based in the ETCL and supported by INKE Partnership members who track, research, and collect findings on policy changes related to open social scholarship — such as citizen science, citizen scholarship, open access, and data management — on a national (Canadian) and international level <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. In doing this, the Open Scholarship Policy Observatory discovers and shares the most effective ways to create, translate, and share knowledge with research, administration, policy, and other communities. The observatory’s primary activity is to publish observations of policies that shape open scholarship. For instance, in 2018 the  “Naylor Report”  was released, a survey of the Canadian higher education funding schema that sent waves through government, universities, and the public alike as it suggested that Canadian research is not funded appropriately <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. We developed a summary of the report (<a href="https://ospolicyobservatory.uvic.ca/canada-fundamental-science-review/">https://ospolicyobservatory.uvic.ca/canada-fundamental-science-review/</a>) outlining the key points and reactions from various stakeholders. More recent observation topics include major events in the open access world such as Plan S (<a href="https://ospolicyobservatory.uvic.ca/plan-s-and-coalition-s/">https://ospolicyobservatory.uvic.ca/plan-s-and-coalition-s/</a>) and the University of California’s decision to not review subscriptions to Elsevier journals (<a href="https://ospolicyobservatory.uvic.ca/the-university-of-californias-split-with-elsevier/">https://ospolicyobservatory.uvic.ca/the-university-of-californias-split-with-elsevier/</a>).</p>
<p>Beyond observations, the site also features responses by INKE Partnership members, a list of open scholarship policies from other countries, and policy clusters, which refer to groups of smaller, interrelated policies. A primary purpose for these findings and activities is to inform the various partners and stakeholders of INKE, in addition to local institutions, government bodies, and other organizations and initiatives, about recent policies and provide the appropriate context for a timely and informed response. The Open Scholarship Policy Observatory is available open access under a CC-BY-SA<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  license in order to encourage access, uptake, and reuse of any posted materials.</p>
<h2 id="32-canadian-humanities-and-social-sciences-commons-hss-commons">3.2. Canadian Humanities and Social Sciences Commons (HSS Commons)</h2>
<p>As a collaborative approach to affecting change in scholarly communication through open social scholarship practices, the INKE Partnership draws from contemporary theory and practice predicated on the understanding that those in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) could and should re-orient their work to be much more engaged with the public at large. All of INKE’s research questions and activity clusters are informed by conceptions of evolving scholarly communication, opening access to research, and creating knowledge in more social ways. With the rise of networked technologies and major computing infrastructure, we witness rapid and substantial changes in knowledge creation — every year brings new possibilities and increased levels of innovation. This is reflected across academic and societal developments that change the way knowledge is produced, shared, distributed, and developed, such as open access and online publishing, the rise of digital scholarship, personal (and often mobile) computing devices, social media, citizen scholars, and shifting information access regulations. The widespread production and adoption of online tools and platforms, such as Wikipedia, presents an opportunity for the public and HSS researchers to participate in shared knowledge-based activities, as well as in inclusive and representative public spaces.</p>
<p>One way that INKE provides open social scholarship infrastructure is by prototyping the Canadian HSS Commons, an online network that connects academics and broader communities. Inspired by the Modern Language Association’s Humanities Commons platform (<a href="https://hcommons.org/">https://hcommons.org/</a>), the Canadian HSS Commons fosters an environment for Canadian HSS researchers to share and access research, publications, and resources, as well as form communities, forge collaborations, create data, and use digital scholarship tools. This commons includes a subject repository for open access publications that assigns digital object identifiers (DOIs) upon upload and follows FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interactive, Reusable) guidelines for data management; a project development environment that can integrate with Google Drive or Dropbox; individual user profiles, with federated login/identity authorization, including with ORCID; blogging capabilities; and mechanisms to support subject interest groups and member interactions (e.g., profile building, messaging). The Canadian HSS Commons offers an alternative to problematic commercial repositories: it is a not-for-profit, open access, and Canada-specific version of an HSS scholarly communication and interaction platform. By making Canadian humanities and social science research data and tools visible and accessible, we encourage a culture that builds on already-developed applications and information rather than repeatedly reinventing the wheel.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The ETCL has developed extensive scholarship focusing on social knowledge creation and open social scholarship over the years <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>, which provides a theoretical framework and historical context that trace the movement of academia towards open social scholarship, as well as the opportunities and challenges that arise with this transition. This intellectual direction lies at the core of INKE Partnership, which is actively engaged in tracing this transition through the Open Scholarship Policy Observatory and provides a platform that supplies a virtual space for academic communities to connect, collaborate, and disseminate research through the Canadian HSS Commons.</p>
<p>As the ETCL evolves with the scholarly landscape toward publicly-engaged, open social scholarship, we return to a key question repeatedly: how do we reflect this direction in our physical place and intellectual space? At the core of this question is a commitment to remain dynamic, with an infrastructure provided by ETCL and C-SKI that allows us to grow into a more open lab and to readjust to the most effective models that reflect this commitment within a DH lab context. Over the last three years, we have formalized this shift in the physical place of the ETCL itself, including by launching programs that open our doors to community members and support a wide variety of public-facing projects. We also continuously foster interdisciplinary local communities through our speaker series, and broader international communities through our annual DHSI and the international INKE Partnership. Through highly collaborative projects and the open physical layout of the ETCL, our  “laboratory has become a space to challenge the isolated scholar model”   <sup id="fnref2:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>, and to engage citizen scholars more broadly. Taken together, the ETCL and its initiatives foster partnership and community relationships that span the region, our nation, and the international community as we, together, investigate what is needed to facilitate open knowledge and open scholarship at scale in a humanistic context.</p>

<p>The ETCL’s Open Knowledge Program also hosts the Honorary Resident Wikipedian initiative, in partnership with the University of Victoria Libraries, the Implementing New Knowledge Environments, and the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences. The role of the Honorary Resident Wikipedian is to give lectures, consult on Wikipedia pages, as well as set the theme for and lead two Wikipedia edit-a-thons annually. Dr. Christian Vandendorpe (U Ottawa) served in this role from 2014–16, and contributed his expertise to improving pages on book history, the encyclopedia, and electronic publishing. Dr. Constance Crompton (U Ottawa) served from 2017–18, and focused on women in STEM on Wikipedia, making Wikipedia a more reliable resource, and contributing to other Wikimedia Foundation projects, especially Wikidata. Dr. Erin Glass (DigitalOcean) assumed this position for the 2019–2020 academic year, and focused on open access in the age of surveillance technology and the role of public imagination in conceptualizing alternative technologies to the status quo. The incoming 2020-2021 Honorary Resident Wikipedian is Silvia Gutiérrez De la Torre (El Colegio de México) who will be leading virtual Wikipedia edit-a-thons that address how students, faculty, and staff can mitigate the barriers to diversity in Wikipedia by tackling the free-time and gender gap, the digital divide, and the lack of resources for certain subjects.&#160;<a href="#fnref:48" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><em>The Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition (DHLC) lab at Michigan State University (MSU) emerged not through top-down strategic planning, but through a combination of university proactivity and serendipitous accident, with an emphasis on the latter.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  It emerged organically from interactions between me and excited students, newly interested MSU colleagues, collaborators from Duke and Stanford&hellip; and at times, people who just happened to be walking by and came in. This odd beginning is precisely what makes our lab such an interesting case study, similar to the development of other humanities labs <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. One common way to approach building such a lab — a trend you might say — is by creating a digital scholarship or digital humanities center, a space devoted to supporting as many different fields, departments, and faculty as possible: building websites,  “provid[ing] a support mechanism for the growing areas of e-research and digital scholarship,”  and facilitating the use of big, expensive pieces of technology (or even better, the analysis of  “big data” ) <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. We have a version of this at MSU, the <a href="http://digitalscholarshiplab.msu.edu/">Digital Scholarship Lab</a>, and it’s amazing. That’s not quite what we do. I can run an MRI and conduct advanced brain imaging, but I can’t build a website to save my life, so I’m glad that others aren’t relying on me or the lab to do this type of DH. Instead, the DHLC began with a specific research question about close reading and literary neuroscience. Now, we design and run a variety of new experiments, opening up the space for ever-growing grassroots engagement with others across campus and with our community.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2012, the lab wasn’t what most would call a  “lab.”  One day, I was working with three students — one from English, one from education, one from neuroscience — at a table we’d dragged from a supply closet. Clustered over our laptops, we were so focused we scarcely looked up as a team of technicians walked in and began installing computers around us. For a DH lab, the moment when the technology appears is normally a glorious occasion; looking back, I can see why the arrival of these computers wasn’t treated with the usual tech-centric revelry. The actual lab was already there — in full swing, fueled by the energy being brought by everyone around the table. The lab was the students, the people. And with them, we got momentum, a combination of student energy and brilliance that would propel us for the next seven years.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s the energy of the people in the lab that sustains me as I navigate the balance of my own work and these new fields we’re engaging. I’m an eighteenth centuryist who gets excited about Margaret Cavendish’s seventeenth-century jokes about the brain, and I also put (willing!) students in brain scanners to see if we can learn more about the cognitive intricacy and uniqueness of reading literature. Fortunately, I work alongside equally interdisciplinary folks. The computer scientist who helped us code our sonnet study at MSU loves poetry so much he actually memorizes it, down to the punctuation (you should hear him recite Whitman or Keats). My co-lead on our music study was a major in violin before he switched to computer science; only later did he jump to cognitive science, focusing on rhythm and music. This sort of interdisciplinary work is not without its limits. As Urszula Pawlicka points out with Bruno Latour, just the name  “humanities lab”  risks assuming an ideologically dangerous  “scientification of the humanities.”  If the laboratory is  “a place that has been socially constructed so as to project the mythos of science onto the world outside its walls,”  she writes,  “then humanities laboratories may begin by borrowing the foreign glamour of science and end by reproducing its ideological parochialisms”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Rather than remaining naïve to such challenges, our lab — with over thirty students from across disciplines — tackles them head-on in an ongoing, energetic attempt to demonstrate that one can do work that cuts across both humanities and sciences without caving to reductionism and instead centering our humanist commitments. We have not given in to an  “interdisciplinary delusion”  but seek to model the pluralism of true cross-disciplinary work, with all the multiplicity it entails <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This is why we are writing this case study — and why we have chosen to tell it collectively. The only way to tell this story is to have students write as well, as equal collaborators and researchers who have made the lab what it is today.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The sounds of the lab on any given day include the clack of typing, the light squeak of pen against dry-erase board, and music — live streaming everything from classical to indie-rock (one undergrad lab lead’s favorite band is Rainbow Kitten Surprise). Academic conversations about our latest lab project on music and narrative intermix with light cursing over how to change font size in E-Prime (the requisite software for taking our poetry study to fMRI). It’s a space for kvetching about grad school applications. Most importantly, it’s a space for laughter, be it a fierce debate on whether the lab’s next event will be an escape room or laser tag, or an equally fierce argument over whose favorite candy is actually disgusting. Entering the lab means joining a warm, rich, chaotic space full of work, odd debates, and enjoyment. The collegial and even goofy atmosphere of the lab is not a weakness — if anything, it energizes our work and makes it more generative. This is our kind of interdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>One of the real strengths of an interdisciplinary and comparatively young field like digital humanities is the sheer amount of experimentation and invention that digital humanists engage in on a daily basis. We have to, because the work we do is often the first of its kind. We can’t help but be cutting-edge, unique, and integrative, because we have limited models to draw from in terms of literary neuroscience. Even as digital humanities labs at prestigious universities such as Stanford, MIT, and CUNY have become well established, there remain many interdisciplinary areas (i.e. literary cognition) that are only just starting to be explored. As the field continues to grow and mature, however, we have the opportunity to build on one another’s wisdom, to create new models and best practices for present and future digital humanities scholars to follow. That is part of what this article seeks to do, inviting readers to learn from the  <em>story</em>  of our challenges as well as our successes.</p>
<p>We cannot, however, give you a template. We do not have a model you can simply copy. There is no formula for how to create your own cutting-edge humanities lab — such a thing does not exist, because the most effective labs and programs build on the specific strengths of a given community. Instead, the following case study it is an exploration of one lab, our Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition (DHLC) lab, with a discussion of some of the approaches and strategies we used to create it. In our current moment when the question is shifting from whether or not to have humanities labs to how those labs should operate in more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable ways, our experiences in the DHLC offer some practices for those working in labs old, new, and yet to be. As you read the specifics of how the DHLC works and why we set it up that way, we invite you to imagine yourself and your own situation — to dream of what your own lab could be.</p>
<p>The Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition (DHLC) lab was founded in 2012. Its first seven years provide a powerful and unique case study that reveals what interdisciplinary work in DH can be, including points of promise and innovation, points of disciplinary tension and translation, and most importantly, lessons that point to the power of actively involving students in a humanities lab. At its core, the DHLC’s mission is to understand how humans think in and through genres of literary art. In other words, we want to understand the intertwined cognitive, neurological, emotional, and cultural processes by which we engage with art, relate to it, and use it to make sense of ourselves. We call our research in cognitive and digital humanities  “literary neuroscience,”  a phrase that captures how such work could never be just one or the other, just humanities or just science.</p>
<p>In 1959, C.P. Snow famously described the humanities and sciences as  “two cultures”  separated by a  “gap”  of  “mutual incomprehension.”  It seemed the two were unable to communicate, and the increasingly siloed nature of disciplinary knowledge throughout the twentieth century did little to help. The present situation is a paradox. As many institutions call for interdisciplinary scholarship and teaching, arts and humanities programs continue to be defunded <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. In this cultural moment, interdisciplinary labs like the DHLC have a vital role to play by communicating across the humanities and sciences, translating the value of the humanities, and in particular, championing the critical perspective that the humanities  <em>brings</em>  to interdisciplinary research.</p>
<p>The DHLC works hard to be a truly interdisciplinary space — we actively integrate methodologies, approaches, and scholars from different disciplines on equal footing. As one example, we always insist on capturing both qualitative and quantitative data whenever we design experiments, and we further ensure that our qualitative data includes space for narrative. The stories and reflections of our study participants are as important as the numbers on an aesthetic pleasure scale, and our student researchers specializing in both humanistic and scientific methods work directly with each other in small groups to analyze the data in tandem. In this way we bring together the strengths of both sciences and humanities, which gives us a richer set of data that enables us to talk to people in different fields in their own languages and concepts.</p>
<p>In pursuing such a significant cultural and academic goal, it can be easy to get lost in the sauce, so we try to keep our day-to-day research practices in perspective. Walking into the DHLC means walking into a space enclosed by the usual four walls, one of which is a window that stretches from floor to ceiling, offering a gorgeous view of trees and the occasional sunset. Double layered, bright green blinds — technologically advanced to move with the changing daylight, yet broken beyond comprehension — seem to have a mind of their own and close and open over the window randomly, making temperature regulation uniquely difficult. To counteract this, we have an ancient box fan, named  “Fanny”  after the protagonist of  <em>Mansfield Park</em> . Eight state-of-the-art computers for processing MRI data, DH visualizations, and project results line two walls, and tables are littered with brightly colored sticky notes that range from complex mathematical equations to single words like  “gender?!?”  There are four different styles of chairs, ranging from the foldable to the  “spinny”  chairs that allow for a dramatic turn to listen to someone talking. A portrait of Jane Austen looks over the lab, observing the years of inside jokes written around the room. Most importantly, this physical room we call our lab — the DHLC — not only brings together students from English, Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Rhetoric, Business, and Art; it creates unique points of contact between them. Neuroscience students read poetry, debate Austen’s irony, and listen to excerpts of orchestral music. Scholars of literature and psychology work together on interdisciplinary fMRI experiment design while artists join computer scientists to develop new digital tools for making art accessible across museum spaces, digital platforms, and coffee shops. There are not many places where a freshman undergrad in political science can talk literary cognition theory with a 5th year English PhD, or where you find professors taking careful notes about sophomores and seniors’ latest project insights. But this is what it means to be at the DHLC.</p>
<p>Our lab has never adhered to traditional hierarchies, and we actively cultivate a lab culture that resists the neoliberal, top-down power structures of the contemporary university <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. We have a PI and lab leads, but these roles are more administrative than anything else. Questions, ideas, answers, and new directions can, should, and do come from everyone (including new researchers bringing fresh perspective to our projects), such that it can be easy to forget who is an undergraduate student, who is a graduate student, and who is a faculty member. Our PI specifically goes by  “Natalie”  in the lab as one way to emphasize our non-hierarchical structure. No one asks your rank when you walk into a lab meeting, nor offers their own; instead, anyone might suggest where you can jump in on the latest spreadsheet or data sorting. Our interdisciplinarity supports this setup, because we recognize that each of our members brings a different set of skills and experiences to the lab. Strict hierarchies simply do not make sense when a third-year student might be the expert on a piece of software, a first-year student might be trained in fMRI, a graduate student might have a music theory background, a faculty member might have several successful grants under her belt, and a fourth-year student might have actually run participants in a particular study. We help each other communicate across these many fields and experiences by holding workshops during our regular meetings where researchers will introduce each other to particular concepts, theories, methods, or software and discuss how to best incorporate that knowledge in our studies. In essence, we all do the work, we all have different roles to play, and we could not possibly do all that the lab does if we assumed that any of those roles is more prestigious or more important.</p>
<p>Bringing together science and humanities in the study of cognition and literary art is certainly a tall order. We  “manage”  it in the lab — day by day and project by project — by relying on an open system and a question-led approach, rather than an institutionally-designed order. This model brings with it particular affordances and limitations. It requires maintaining an open lab space in collaboration with student researchers and project leads while also ensuring secure storage for study participants’ data. It relies heavily on the energy and guidance of both the PI and the lab leads. It invites students from all kinds of disciplines who never dreamed of being part of a lab to join in the work of creating knowledge. It means that projects are abandoned partway through, or unnecessarily redone, or go in three directions at once; it also leads to astonishing breakthroughs. It loses some portion of institutional knowledge with every student researcher’s graduation. It can also feel overwhelming especially for new lab members, so we introduce new researchers to the lab’s projects one at a time in order to help them learn about the projects, navigate the IRB process, and let them choose where and how they want to participate according to their interests and availability. It means keeping in regular contact with weekly meetings for the different projects, with constant reminders to take breaks and step back from the work in order to take care of ourselves and each other. And, crucially, it must ensure that all researchers (especially students!) are compensated and credited for their work in the forms of hourly pay, presentations at conferences, and authorship on lab publications. All of this continues to successfully sustain the lab after eight years with minimal advertising (mostly by word of mouth in classes) because it draws people in and gives them the space to explore their own research practices.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each semester, lab leads for each of the three major research projects present broad semester goals. At the same time, if any group members come up with a hypothesis, they are given a semester or two to play around with the new approach. If the research idea seems sustainable, it becomes a long-term project and is incorporated into a future beginning-of-semester goal presentation. If not, we store detailed notes on the process in a  “research questions”  document for future reference. For example, one of the undergraduate researchers got so excited about metaphors that he spent a full semester mapping how often participants highlighted metaphors and how tangible, familiar, or cliché the metaphors were. Although this got stored away for a year, it turns out that it will be absolutely pivotal as we start writing a new article (TBA) for a special issue of  <em>Narrative</em>  in 2023 titled  “When Do We Love Literature?: The Pleasures of Poetry Reading and the Power of Story.”</p>

<p>Our projects range from fMRI studies of novel reading, to experiments on poetry and pleasure, to cultural explorations of the stories we hear in music. Outside the world of interdisciplinary experiments, the DHLC also organizes exhibitions that blend art, medical humanities, and disability studies to create accessible art installations in museums where everyone — including those along the visual disability spectrum — can  <em>touch</em>  the art. This means we have used DH tools that range from computational software for analyzing brain data and patterns in neural activation (FSL), text analysis tools such as Voyant and sentiment analysis, and Guide by Cell, the latest web-based link that we use to provide audio descriptions for Accessible Art visitors with visual disabilities (much better than QR codes). The fact that we use DH tools so much in order to  <em>do</em>  our research makes the lab an equally fascinating case study in how digital tools blend the virtual and physical. Depending on the day and number of computers, we use Skype, Zoom, or Google Hangouts, we write and edit on Google Drive, and we communicate in almost twenty Slack channels for different projects, though most researchers are active primarily in the few related to their chosen projects. In the image above, a lost-in-sauce meme motivated students to focus in the last frantic hours of poster writing before our yearly undergraduate conference (see Figure 1). We use many of these same channels to talk with collaborators around the world: Stanford University, New York University, The University of Arkansas, Princeton University, and the University of Hong Kong. In these ways, our lab is quite expansive, both physically and virtually <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This highly collaborative nature of our digital humanities research makes our lab a  “hybrid space,”  something Steve Harrison and Paul Dourish define as a space that  “comprises both physical and virtual”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. We experience this physical–digital interplay in the lab daily, in embodied interactions that are  “framed simultaneously by the physical space, the virtual space and the relationship between the two”   <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Interdisciplinary work in the lab involves bridging not only disciplines but also places and practices, and how we conduct research is in many ways defined and delimited by both physical and virtual spaces (see Figure 2). For instance, our lab is located at Michigan State University (MSU). Most of our lab members and participants therefore reflect typical university demographics and range in ages from seventeen to thirty-five. Thus, we constantly remind ourselves when analyzing data that we have a particular group of college students who like coffee and poetry, are interested in $5 Starbucks gift cards to participate in our latest study, and have many other time commitments in their studies, work, and social lives. The lab’s physical space comfortably fits only approximately ten of our thirty lab members at a time. Accessibility measures are also ironically difficult in a lab that intentionally organizes accessible art events — Natalie uses a rolling walker when needed but can’t fit it inside our small space.</p>

<p>The role space plays in defining research becomes even more apparent when that research involves placing people in circular magnetic tubes. As Joshua Mann notes of digital technologies used to represent the past, nothing about this present technology is  “hermeneutically neutral”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. The MRI scanner presents a panoply of physical limitations on research almost too numerous to describe. Students cannot bring a paperback inside a scanner, so they read a digital rendition of a  “page”  (or sonnet) at the back of the scanner through a mirror above their eyes, pushing a button or scrolling with a mouse to move through the lines and pages.</p>
<p>Head movement in an MRI machine means the scan will pick up on the wrong brain regions, so we make a participant as comfortable as possible, providing ear-plugs to drown out the noise of pulse sequences, as well as foam pillows under their knees, for their elbows, and alongside their head for comfort. In this case, we accept the unique constraints on physical space inside an MRI scanner (we can’t change Radiology&hellip;yet), but we use our humanist background to push to the very edges of what’s traditionally allowed to be seen inside a scanner. In a radical humanist departure from MRI tradition, our participants read long sections of novels and poetry  <em>at their own pace</em> , rather than being presented with single sentences or phrases flashing rhythmically on the screen. Yes, the physical constraints determine the research that can be done. Yet DH can open new opportunities, as the DHLC’s first project demonstrates.</p>
<p>The lab’s first project,  “Jane Austen and the Neuroscience of Reading and Attention,”  was an fMRI study of the different levels of attention we can bring to a novel and specifically the differences between close and pleasure reading <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Eighteen Ph.D. students in English (picked for their literary training) were asked to read the first chapters of Jane Austen’s  <em>Mansfield Park</em>  inside an MRI, switching between close reading and pleasure reading at defined sections. Afterward, outside the scanner, they wrote informal literary essays on the sections they’d close read. To our astonishment, they ended up quoting the text extensively from memory <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Sponsored by an ACLS Digital Innovations grant, we also began to map the unique patterns of quoting from Mansfield Park, revealing an attraction to tangible and material words in the text and how these mnemonic anchors grounded sophisticated analysis of class dynamics, stylistics, gender roles, and Austen’s irony. Analysis is still ongoing, but this first experiment exemplifies the spontaneity and delightful accident that marks all our projects. In seeking to study the different levels of attention we bring to books, we ended up being the first study of natural reading. Based on an article gone viral, the study also ended up being an unexpected showcase for the value of literary study, revealing the widespread brain regions activated by close reading, a core skill in the liberal arts <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this study and the other DHLC projects we describe in the coming pages reveal how digital humanities labs can take an active role in championing the humanities in our communities. We believe that the interdisciplinary, non-hierarchical structure of our lab is valuable philosophically, politically, and practically. We see the different fields represented in the lab as equally important partners in our work, rather than science chasing humanities or humanities chasing science. In the same vein, the members of our lab are equally important partners in our work, regardless of university rank. Together, these approaches shake up the relationships between fields and between people, giving everyone ownership in what the lab does and reminding us that everyone can and should be part of the process of expanding human knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="the-pleasures-of-poetry-reading">The Pleasures of Poetry Reading</h2>
<p>_We could say that the international recognition our first study of Austen received naturally led to a second project,  “Neuroaesthetics: Poetry and Aesthetic Pleasure.”  We moved from novels to poetry, conducting an experiment that emerged organically from a research group centered at NYU on the neural and cognitive dimensions of aesthetic experience. In reality, I was grading papers for a course on the eighteenth-century novel with a friend when an unexpected email arrived from a Dean at NYU declaring she and her colleagues had been following my research and inviting me to join a global collaboration on neuroscience and art. I knew if I wanted to take this on — that is, involve the lab in designing three new experiments on literature, music, and art — I would need to bring the lab with me. I said yes, and boarded a plane to New York… with three students in tow. _</p>
<p><em>What I didn’t expect was that it was absolutely necessary that the students be there. Sitting at the table in a group of neuroscientific leaders, I watched in awe as they offered insights (and even experimental critiques) again and again, gaining the respect of famous scholars in the neuroscience of music, vision, and art. Yet, as we all know, most of the work — and many of the decisions — happens, not in the conference room, but over dinner. During the wining and dining, the students mixed and mingled with enviable ease, picking up comments that would prove invaluable. Had they been virtually present over Skype, all that would have been lost. On our final night, free from the formality of fine dining, we ordered to-go Indian food and clustered over our laptops in my hotel room. As we pieced together our notes from the weekend, and laughed over the comic tidbits we’d overheard, we dropped all previous expectations and began to design a totally new experiment on poetry — one that would advance Neuroaesthetics and further define the DHLC. As we worked and laughed, I realized the lab had been moved, so to speak, to a small hotel room in New York, with plastic knives and chana masala in styrofoam cups.</em></p>
<p>Forging ahead with the energy from that first trip to NYU, and in ongoing collaboration with G. Gabrielle Starr, we designed a study looking at real-time responses to poetry <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. We wanted to capture readers’ aesthetic reactions to poems as well as how their pleasure shifted as they read; thus, we asked participants to highlight moments they found aesthetically pleasing and displeasing while reading sonnets. First with pencil and paper, later with red and green highlights on a computer screen, fifty MSU students registered their aesthetic responses when reading a set of sonnets drawn from the early modern period to now. After reading and highlighting, participants were asked to use a provided numerical scale to rate the vividness of imagery, the poem’s positive or negative overall theme, and the intensity of their own emotional response. What we found fascinating is that, while individual tastes clearly differ, there are stunning similarities in moments people collectively find moving. For example, reading  “Dawn in New York,”  a sonnet by key Harlem Renaissance writer Claude McKay, 60% of participants single out the description of women and men wandering the streets of Manhattan with  “wine-weakened”  eyes as particularly aesthetically pleasing <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. At this point pleasure aligned across readers, revealing an unexpected moment of cognitive and emotional unity.</p>
<p>The data for each sonnet was so rich, with so many things to explore, that students involved in the poetry study decided to pursue two distinct research questions. One group (nicknamed  “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2017/03/03/guide-all-those-weird-words-your-teen-uses/98688930/">LIT</a>” ) is exploring the question of why so many people  “like”  (or positively highlighted) obviously negative words and phrases.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  They observed, with a wry joy, that participants hadn’t only positively highlighted moments of aesthetic pleasure associated with positive themes (i.e. love, sunrises, hope) but also took pleasure in negative themes (i.e. war and sadness). For instance, participants found poetic beauty in McKay’s  “cheerless domes;”  similarly, in Michael Ferris’  “The Catskill Eagle,”  numerous participants loved the moment where the sonnet describes  “rage and wonder battle cruel, and strange”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. The other group became fascinated with the question of the potential differences between how English majors and non-English majors read and enjoy poetry, with a zeal that earned them the group name  “Oxford Comma.”  Curious about the influence of a literary education on aesthetic pleasure, they decided to design and run another set of experiments. Fueled by coffee and candy from our famously always-full candy pitcher and recently-donated Keurig machine, they ran another approximately thirty psychology majors as participants (see Figure 3).</p>

<p>In the new experiments, Psychology majors highlighted what they loved (and didn’t) about poetry, providing key data to match up with the previous data from English majors. Immediately, we noticed radical differences in aesthetic pleasure, with Psychology students generally loving Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and English students delighting instead in the far lesser known poem, Catherine Chandler’s  “Henslow’s Sparrow.”  Though Chandler’s poem opens with extensive descriptions of the elusive bird, it turns, mid-poem, to admit the poet has never heard or seen one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or so they say; for I have yet to spy  the shy, elusive bird, or hear its song,  except in Audubon recordings. I  admit to shaky faith, but play along; and though my yard’s a skirl of jays and crows,  someday it might show up. One never knows.<br>
<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> The part English majors love best is the final cryptic phase:  “One never knows.”  In a world where students notoriously complain that they don’t like poetry because they don’t know what it means, the English majors are  <em>drawn</em>  to the uncertain ending that one can  “never know [sic].”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What students highlighted as particularly pleasing (or not) grew more and more riveting to us as we gathered more responses. Some phrases in poems stood out to a majority of readers, either positively or negatively. But before we could answer that, we had to be able to see it. We tried bolding words that participants had repeatedly highlighted, but this method couldn’t represent the magnitude of students who loved or hated a phrase. Based on the number of likes we tried changing the font size by statistical increments but the rest of the poem was too small to be read. The best answer we could find was to create a statistical highlighting system where words and phrases got darker and darker, in green for pleasure and red for displeasure, which worked well enough until we reached a point where so many people liked or disliked a word that you could no longer see it. Our lab solution was to just turn that word white (see Figure 4). Fortunately, MSU is invested in DH beyond the lab, and had just created a Digital Scholarship Lab in the library. We reached out with a rough idea in mind to solve the visualization problem and they quickly set us up with someone who knew a technology for heat mapping. Together, their GIS specialist and an English undergrad from the lab solved the problem that we had been staring at for a year using ArcGIS, a geographical mapping software. The result was a heatmap that showed where participants collectively found the most pleasure and displeasure in the sonnets they read. Amusingly, we later returned to the Digital Scholarship Lab as invited presenters, with our co-created poetry heat map on display. The presentation received many excited questions for our innovative use of ArcGIS — a testament to how interdisciplinary scholarship can generate new, often unexpected engagements with digital tools that push our questions and how we answer them further.</p>
<p>The poetry study epitomizes the crucial role physical place and in-person interactions play in advancing the work that goes on in and beyond the lab. Being in the same physical space allows us to rapidly iterate on experiment design, data analysis, and digital tool development in our studies, responding to theoretical concerns and practical considerations as they emerge. However the poetry study also demonstrates how the physical, the virtual, and the digital are increasingly blurred in an interdisciplinary lab. As our most recent study on music and narrative cognition reveals, online collaboration and digital tools for both communication and community research are just as essential for understanding how we encounter literary art in the twenty-first century.</p>
<h2 id="narrative-perceptions-of-music">Narrative Perceptions of Music</h2>
<p>_Some studies come from concerted effort and invited collaboration, as at NYU. Others emerge by serendipitous accident. This was certainly the case for our study on the stories we hear in music. I had gone to Nashville with my fiancé for one of his (many) music cognition conferences. I’d skipped out of most of the talks and spent much of my time exploring the streets of Nashville, with its eccentric restaurants, huge musical billboards, and fabulous collection of old bookstores. But one poster session caught my eye, so I made my way back to the conference, keeping my badge face-down to stay blissfully incognito. As I read over a poster on  “close listening”  to music, I marveled at the structural similarity to our Austen study’s exploration of close and pleasure reading. All of a sudden, the presenter appeared and said:  “Oh my goodness, it’s you!”  I swiftly learned she had designed her study at Stanford intentionally building off our previous work. She had tons of questions and I was happy to help, delving into a conversation that lasted far beyond the poster session and carried us down the stairs toward lunch. I saw my fiancé deeply engaged in a conversation about budget practicalities with the new treasurer for the society, and told her we’d need to meet up later, exchanging cards. When she turned to me on the last step and said,  “I can’t believe we met. The Brain on Jane!”  the acoustics of the space magnified her voice so that (it seemed) the whole room heard. Certainly, my fiance’s conversation about treasury suddenly ended; his companion, Lisa, evidently familiar with our study, promptly turned to me and said,  “You’re a cognitive narratologist? There’s something I need you to see.” _</p>
<p>Lisa Margulis, it turns out, is an interdisciplinary scholar who runs the <a href="http://www.elizabethmargulis.com/about-music-cognition-lab/">Music Cognition Lab</a> in the Music department at U. Arkansas (soon to be moving to Princeton). She ran a study where she had participants listen to music without words and asked them to describe any story they heard; a surprising number of people did indeed hear a story <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. She sat Natalie down and had her read some of the narratives they wrote, many of which were incredibly similar, often sharing the same topics, themes, even specific words. The images she showed Natalie — expanded and extended to represent the full experiment — were to become for us the crucial narrative data to explore convergences (and divergences) in the stories people hear in music. When Natalie got back she called the lab leads together at the DHLC and asked the unaskable question:  “I know we have a lot going on at the lab — too much already. I’m tired, you’re tired… still, is it interesting enough for us to run with it anyway?”  Everyone was fascinated. And, despite the amount of work we had, it was too interesting to  <em>not</em>  work with.</p>
<p>Supported by a number of fellowships (written together over Skype), an ever-accumulating number of collaborators, and a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, we began to explore whether — particularly how and when — we use narratives to understand music. In other words, when trying to make sense of a new piece of music, do we begin to  “hear”  stories — or, certain types of stories? How much do the tendencies to construct narratives when listening to music, and to have those narratives align, depend on cultural background? The study itself is deceptively simple: participants listen to a piece of orchestral music and are asked if they imagined a story or elements of a story while listening. If they say yes, they are asked to describe the imagined story in as much detail as possible. The similarities in participant answers were often startling. For example, almost 74% of participants listening to an excerpt of Liszt’s music at U. Arkansas described a  “cat-and-mouse story”  (see Figure 5).</p>

<p>For the excerpt from Telemann’s  “Suite in E Major, II,”  a completely different narrative emerged for listeners: 88% of these subjects imagined wealthy — even royal — characters dancing in a fancy ballroom. Unlike the cat-and-mouse stories, participants listening to Telemann were highly focused on setting. According to their descriptions, any narrative activities — dancing, feasting, socializing, etc. — took place, not consecutively (i.e. cat chases mouse, mouse runs, cat chases again, etc&hellip;), but recursively, choreographed in social tandem.</p>
<p>In order to assess how much cultural context affects these narratives, we are partnering with researchers at the U. of Hong Kong to compare results of our narrative listening studies at U. Arkansas and Michigan State with participants from rural China. In this new cross-cultural version of the study, participants from U. Arkansas, MSU,  <em>and</em>  regions of rural China listen to both Chinese and Western music, allowing us to explore if cultural familiarity with a certain musical style affects the likelihood of imagining stories, or the similarity of the stories they tell. Through five iterations of this study, from the original at U. Arkansas to the ongoing research in China, we have data from a total of 1202 participants. After Natalie’s in-person meeting with Lisa, the rest of the NSF  <em>Narrative Perceptions of Music</em>  study unfolded in virtual space. The musical selections are stored online and played for participants on a computer, with participants’ responses stored carefully in coded Excel files. Since our collaboration spans the globe as well as the country, most of our conversations happen online, fitting the trend of increasingly digital scholarly communication <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Messages and results wing back and forth between MSU, U. Arkansas, and the U. of Hong Kong. Most often, we use Zoom, Google Hangouts or Skype to create a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and cross-institutional space to allow ethno-musicologists, computational sound-technicians, cognitive musicologists and narrative theorists to connect. Bringing a variety of DH and humanistic tools to the analysis of these narratives, we are beginning to explore how much these music-inspired storylines converge or diverge for each piece — with the goal of testing this across cultures. This means that at any given time, walking into the lab, you might find people dispersed, each working on a different computer and using a different DH tool to explore similarities and points of uniqueness in our now ~1,500 musical stories. At one computer, we have a student (relatively new to the lab) using Voyant to offer a first-round exploration of common themes in the seventy-nine stories from the students at U. Arkansas listening to musical excerpt WA15. With appropriate stop words, we can begin to see what stands out as a through-line for the stories linked to this particular piece. Do people tend to invoke pirates? Dancing squirrels? Star Wars and/or lightsabers? Out of the word-cloud, we can then return relatively quickly to the specific stories and check their context for more nuance and richness, always keeping a humanities eye out for themes that might go unnoticed by sheer word count. Comments jotted down on a sticky note pose questions: 1) Do these commonly-used words actually point us to themes? 2) Does sheer frequency of a phrase reveal focus? 3) How about what’s implied or left unsaid here&hellip;which often seems to carry as much meaning as the explicit and stated?!?</p>
<p>If you look next to her, on the same side of the lab is an English major, who jumped into our poetry study so early and deeply that he taught himself E-Prime, the standard tool for creating computerized experimental design and data collection. Now, having finished designing macros for our lab computers to make certain common lab tasks easier, and having finished developing an algorithm to map word count for our ever-increasing data-set of stories that people heard in music, we find him deep in network analysis, looking to see how often key terms and phrases from the music-inspired storylines intersected for different pieces of music. He’s never lost his English side — you should hear him go on about metaphor theory some day.</p>
<p>Across the lab, with headphones in and deeply focused, is a tech-savvy grad student in English and DH developing a tool in R to improve sentiment analysis for our narratives, seeking to assess subtle similarities and differences in the  <em>mood</em>  or  <em>tone</em>  of the stories that might otherwise go unnoticed. In a previous effort to do this for ~500 stories with sentiment analysis tools from IBM Watson and Stanford NLP, two dogged undergrads ran into problems so obvious we couldn’t continue without digging into the algorithm. Our funniest example was about ducks. As it turned out both IBM Watson and Stanford NLP rated a student-imagined story about a bunch of ducks swimming in a pond gathering food as  “strongly negative.”  Other less comic cases of this abounded, and, knowing that we must be thinking critically about these tools, we decided,  “why not just create our own.”  Thus, our brilliant grad student developing a tool in R to better analyze the sentiment of our narratives and capture moods that will always slip by word count.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, no matter how many different tools we’re working with (or how many people are at the lab), someone usually jokingly admits that candy isn’t cutting it.  “I’m going to need a drink after this… does anyone want to join?”  and off we go to a local bar or restaurant. We stay away from work as much as we can at the bar but conversation often includes laughing over the inside jokes and funniest stories we’ve seen. Some of our favorites examples include:  “I imagined a fight between two squirrels,”    “This music sounded like a mixture of Michael Myers and clowns,”  and  “plz stp playing songs that stress me out.”  While all of these last examples happened  <em>in</em>  (or near) the lab,  <em>Narrative Perceptions of Music</em>  is one of the best studies for talking about how extensive a role virtual tools play in DHLC life, especially considering the national and international collaborations. At one point we met with Lisa virtually on Google Hangouts to discuss challenges with the system we were developing for categorizing the narratives. With the help of our new technological tool, OWL, we could have 360 degree video conference camera scope that allowed access to the whole room while automatically shifting focus to different people as they spoke. Still better, everyone in the room could hear (and be heard) while simultaneously being seen no matter where they were. This technology helped the conversation stay vibrant and productive, bringing people together over great distance <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Modeling the spirit of the lab, Lisa and Devin (two full professors) listened intently as students offered critical feedback on how literary scholars would approach narrative categorization. For instance, when they offered the example  “I imagined animated shadows creeping over the walls”  as an abstract narrative without characters or agents, students were able to offer feedback as equals. When our undergraduate lab lead pointed out that shadows (as well as colors, objects, animals, etc.) could be considered agents (i.e. characters), traditional professorial power dynamics went out the window. Lisa simply said  “I trust your intuition as a literary scholar.”</p>
<p>It is this same spirit of equality and open-access that motivates our development of <a href="https://adagia.org/">Adagia</a>, an online app that collects and maps the narratives of users who listen to a short musical excerpt and share any story they heard (see Figure 6). Their response is immediately visible to them (and others) on a GPS-based map, allowing us to explore how local and cultural influences shape the stories. Our long-term goal for Adagia is to allow users to enrich and reshape the project (adding new music samples online, suggesting new questions, or proposing an easier coding platform). Crowdsourcing traditional scientific research, rendering it online, and making it humanities-friendly, this digital work will also yield an ever-expanding set of stories ripe for DH text analytics. We view Adagia as filling a similar role to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, an online platform often used to scale up psychology research, but without the corporate overlords or problematic labor practices <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. The virtual and digital elements of our work allow us to reimagine our situated research practices and bring our work beyond the DHLC, MSU, and China.</p>

<p>_In Lab Girl, Hope Jahren has a beautiful and moving description of her lab space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My laboratory is a place where the lights are always on. My laboratory has no windows, but it needs none. It is self-contained. It is its own world. My lab is both private and familiar, populated by a small number of people who know one another well. My lab is the place where I put my brain out on my fingers and I do things….In my lab, whatever I need is greatly outbalanced by what I have. The drawers are packed full with items that might come in handy. Every object in my lab — no matter how small or misshapen — exists for a reason, even if its purpose has not yet been found….The door is locked and I know everyone who has a key. Because the outside world cannot come into the lab, the lab has become the place where I can be the real me. (18-19)<br>
_</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I find this gorgeous because it captures such a strong part of how I feel about the DHLC. Yet there’s a part of the lab that’s different; something central to its beauty. Yes, the lab is its own world and a sanctuary to me. Yes, it’s stocked with objects whose purpose may not have been found (yet). But every time I go into the lab, I see both people who I know well and people I’ve never met before. And it’s just as often the people I’ve never seen before who have suddenly (I learn) solved an experimental problem — or a problem with complex software and coding — I didn’t even know existed. This shows what it means to be an  “open”  humanities lab. We have IRB to protect the confidentiality of brain data, but since the IRB training is essential and free, the lab is radically and powerfully open. This means that problems are solved from the ground up, not top-down. And that the students come up with new questions to ask about each and every project we do, with an energy that carries it far beyond the original idea.</em></p>
<p><em>The ultimate proof of this came when I had to go down briefly for medical leave. I’ll admit, egocentrically, I worried that the lab would come to a complete and grinding halt without me. Instead, it flourished as much it always has, possibly even more, since the students knew, deeply now, that what I’d been telling them — that they had the leadership, they had to trust their own instincts, and they could take it forward — was true. They’d been trained for it. This is the ultimate proof that the lab is not vertically driven, nor hierarchical by nature; it continued and prospered while the director was down. Two English majors from a class I taught who joined the lab while I was away ended up, in their first semester, designing and running an entire new branch of the poetry study, getting scientists to highlight the aspects of the poems they found most powerful (or not). Another group went out into the dormitories and hallways and gathered everyday students’ definitions of aesthetic pleasure. Perhaps most impressively, an Accessible Art event that I’d been working on, pulled out of my hands by necessity, expanded based on student innovation to include not just students — as had been my original model — but local community artists and a week-long public exhibition. While away, I found myself missing the lab more than I can say; going in to the DHLC had always meant going into a space where things were happening&hellip;where students always had new projects and ideas (not that three experiments and an accessible art project weren’t enough to keep us on our toes). Not that I’m back, I realize what I missed most; the vibrance in the atmosphere — and the sanctuary it provided, always showing, rather than telling that humanists and scientists could do things together&hellip;at times, brilliantly&hellip;and in ways that expand beyond experiments into the community.</em></p>
<p>One of the most powerful ways the DHLC breaks the mold of what labs usually do (obscure experiments behind closed doors) is through a series of multisensory and inclusive art exhibits that have come to be known as Accessible Art. In 2015 the student editor of  <em>Exceptions</em> , a journal housed within the DHLC that publishes work by and for people with visual disabilities, approached an English professor and an art professor with the idea for a touchable art exhibit. English students would select or create a sensory-rich passage of text, which students in the art class would use as inspiration for a multisensory piece of art. The Accessible Art exhibit was born with the motto  “Touch the Art!”  After that first year,  <em>Exceptions</em>  editors continued to plan different accessible artistic events, including a second Accessible Art exhibit in 2017. In honor of Veteran’s day this exhibit focused on depictions of war, and <a href="https://www.exceptionsjournal.com/blog/2017/11/sense-of-self">drew over 200 visitors</a>. One wrote,  “This changed the paradigm of art for me, before this event I only thought of art as visual and did not consider the fact that art can and should engage all senses and be accessible for all people.”  Another put it this way:  “it was actually accessible to everyone. QR codes were available to have the literary aspects of the art read aloud and then of course we were encouraged to touch the art, which is something unheard of in a museum.”  Our events were never only about opening museum spaces to visitors with visual disabilities, important as such work is. Instead, we sought to encourage every visitor to think about engaging with art in a different way. The enjoyment that comes from the multi-sensory indulgence of touching the untouchable opens people’s minds to consider what a more inclusive and accessible world might look like (see Figure 7).</p>

<p>It was precisely this call for art to engage all senses and all people that guided our vision for the 2019 exhibit. Natalie was on medical leave, but it didn’t occur to us to question whether a group of students could pull off the project ourselves — our collective years with the lab had taught us we could. We began with the pattern of the two previous exhibits, and in August 2018 a few graduate students attended a folk art festival and met a local quiltmaker. Her fidget quilts — lap blankets with tassels, beads, textural patterns, zippers, and ribbons — give people with Alzheimer’s and dementia something to play with that soothes the restlessness than often accompanies those diseases (see Figure 8).</p>

<p>We wanted her art as part of the exhibit, and started dreaming of an event that brought together student and community art. The project grew to include almost a dozen undergraduate and graduate students on the planning team as well as nearly fifty undergraduate students and community members creating multi-sensory art, designing the exhibit, documenting the exhibit’s accessibility, writing grants, and organizing tours for local schools. In addition to the fidget quilt, our art pieces included other textiles, like a piece of embroidery that uses both Braille and the Latin alphabet. Another installation was a mirror hung at forty inches from the ground, the proper level for someone in a wheelchair, surrounded by selfies the artist has taken of herself in mirrors around the MSU campus; the pictures are mostly the top of her head and empty space, because the mirrors are too high. Visitors were encouraged to take selfies in this mirror — people who don’t use wheelchairs will mostly get torso shots, demonstrating what it feels like when the world is not set up for you. Numerous sculptures played with texture, like one that is mixed metal and ceramics, another that incorporates moss, and a third that is a window box full of fake flowers created from materials like yarn, tulle, pipe cleaners, and feathers.</p>
<p>The 2019 Accessible Art exhibit is a testament to the way the DHLC empowers its members not only to take on independent work but also to take it outside the lab itself. Our  “closed”  lab is just one node in an open, interconnected web that stretches across the campus, country, and world, similar to other emerging art labs <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-a-lab-digital-humanities-interdisciplinary-futures">What’s in a Lab? Digital Humanities, Interdisciplinary Futures</h2>
<p><em>The brief sketches of the DHLC and its projects, students, and possibilities that we’ve included here are only the beginning of where our lab has been, and where it is going. It certainly hasn’t always been easy to organize and run an interdisciplinary DH lab, but thankfully I’ve had the support of many fantastic colleagues — including my students — in doing so. In so many ways, the DHLC is driven by student innovation and research, including students creating their own studies using the skills and tools they learned in the lab. For example, graduate students Cody Mejeur, Soohyun Cho, and Jes Lopez have designed experiments that identify the neural networks involved in narrative comprehension in video games, investigate the cognitive and cultural effects of Kindle Popular Highlights, and analyze the representations of autistic characters in literature and film through embedded sentiment, respectively.</em></p>
<p>_If I could sum up the most important lessons I’ve learned along the way for those interested in building and running similar labs, these would be my main points:<br>
<strong>Involve students as equals.</strong>  Not just as students but as lively, active, curious people. Let them explore and grow. Even better, treat them with the respect you give your colleagues and global collaborators. You’ll be astonished.      <strong>Accept that serendipitous accidents will grow into new things</strong> : a lab, an fMRI, a poetry study, or a series of accessible art exhibits. Embrace it, and embrace the fact that each new project will make you want a new tool.     <strong>Things expand: be ready</strong>  (it’s going to be okay). The lab can’t hold it all, so reserve extra rooms.     <strong>Think of interdisciplinary as pluralism</strong> . It’s not DH vs traditional methods, but rather a both/and situation that involves a lot of translation work, over and over again.     <strong>Allow yourself the joy of working with students</strong> . Running a lab is a lot of work, I won’t lie. But you’ll experience moments of personal fulfillment and pride in a group that are absolutely unrivaled.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p><em>In the  <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> , Jonathan Kramnick claims we are living in an academic moment governed by  “The Interdisciplinary Delusion”   <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. And there are days when it does feel like a delusion, but not the one that Kramnick cites. It feels like a delusion when on the morning of a university-wide research competition, I stop by the lab to see students in English, Biology, and Education still adding new data to their posters, and then, hours later, watch them accept the top prize. When I return from medical leave to discover that students have run two new studies despite joining the lab just a month earlier. When I step into the Broad Art Museum for the lab’s Accessible Art exhibition and get to touch my first work of student art and feel how they captured an element of the poetry. It’s the brilliance and energy of the students that are drawn to this work, not the facade of interdisciplinary novelty, that so astonishes and inspires me.</em></p>
<p><em>Interdisciplinary work is a shift of view, not a truth claim. No one in the lab and none of my colleagues feel that we will somehow find the absolute truth about poetry and pleasure. Far from it. Instead we are simply using a different set of tools to get a glimpse into what 30 students love, or hate, about sixteen sonnets. Our music and narrative study may extend to China, but it has the same limits. The excitement isn’t all  “an interdisciplinary fantasy of the moment.”  It comes from real students, professors, and colleagues around the world who have their own deep disciplinary training and are contributing it to illuminate a new facet that otherwise would never have been seen about how we engage with literature, music, and art.</em></p>
<p>The common fear of digital humanities and other interdisciplinary fields like literary neuroscience is that we are attempting to scientize the humanities, making them more quantifiable, measurable, and profitable <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Without wading too deeply into a longstanding debate about the validity of these fields, we want to acknowledge that there are reasons to be cautious about a type of interdisciplinary research that just seeks to import scientific knowledge to the humanities in order to attract more institutional support and grant dollars <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. In the DHLC, we make it a primary goal to challenge this trend. We believe that truly interdisciplinary work isn’t a one-way street, as though the sciences have the authority on truth and reality and the humanities are here merely to dress it up. Rather, we are proud of having a lab space that humanitizes the sciences, seeing young neuroscientists regularly reading literature and poetry, and introducing scholars in English, Education, Rhetoric, and other areas to neuroscience and digital tools for analyzing artistic media. Interdisciplinary digital humanities labs are uniquely positioned to make these points of contact happen, and to do the critical work of championing the humanities and resisting the institutional privileging of the sciences.</p>
<p>In an age where human life is increasingly shaped by digital media — indeed, where we seem to be evolving alongside our technology, as N. Katherine Hayles argues — brain imaging technology can give us new insight on how human meaning-making is embodied, and how it operates in different digital contexts <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. At the same time, our ability to critique the forms, power, and ideologies that shape the sciences we use helps us to encounter the limits of neuroscience — all the many places where existing studies fail to account for the rich diversity of human experience <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. The implications of such understandings are potentially far-reaching. For example, knowing how we close read and pleasure read differently can change how we teach and approach texts, or learning how we perceive music as narrative can affect how we compose and use everything from advertising jingles to symphonies.</p>
<p>Our work in the digital humanities and literary cognition is just one of many possible sites for interdisciplinary collaboration and research. Imagine, for example, what humanities-based ecocriticism labs might look like, or consider what the humanities could bring to the critical coding and computing centers and networks that have sprung up in recent years <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  In many ways we have only begun to see the potential combinations and new perspectives that such lab work can generate. And even on the level of individual labs, as the DHLC demonstrates, work is expanding beyond the walls of any one institution into many physical and virtual spaces across the globe <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. Approaches from the DHLC have inspired the structure and process of other digital humanities labs, like Dr. Stephen Grandchamp’s <a href="https://umfdh.org/">Digital Humanities Lab</a> at the University of Maine at Farmington, which utilizes the student-led model of the DHLC by having undergraduates work with faculty to integrate DH into curricula and to provide one-on-one instruction for students. Grandchamp also adjusted and adapted this model in ways that are different from how the DHLC run: all his student assistants have been hired as freshmen with the goal of working four complete years in the lab. This creative reconfiguration has led to brilliant work for DH outreach in Maine — the student assistants are taking the lead on a digital archival project by scanning the historical catalogs (including creative writing and visual art) of a local seed cooperative with the goal of creating a fully-searchable online archive.</p>
<p>Of course there are good reasons to be suspicious of these trends, and thankfully the humanities draw our attention to questions of access, privilege, and power in pursuing them <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Still, if there is anything we have learned that can help others in running, starting, or just considering a lab, it is that embracing a  “try everything”  ethos can lead to unexpected and generative opportunities for changing how we think, especially when trying everything is inclusive of different peoples and supportive of their skills, knowledges, and goals. Our research practices are always situated within various types of institutions, traditions, and systems of power, but they also always hold out the possibility for new and revolutionary insights to spontaneously emerge. To be more specific to the digital humanities, if we are to critically engage with digital technologies, then we have to be willing to let those engagements evolve and emerge to address the critical question or situation at hand. We also have to be open to taking risks, and even to failing. After all, we can learn just as much (and sometimes more!) from the experiments that fail as the ones that produce promising results. The great benefit of prioritizing the humanities in this trial and error is that they can guide the process, minimizing the harm and emphasizing the importance of considering the meanings and ethics behind research projects. This interdisciplinary work is not the delusion of one moment in higher education, it is an ongoing project that contributes to answering some of the most pernicious problems of the twenty-first century.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<p>How we as digital humanities (DH) scholars construct the laboratory — as a space, as a culture, as an imaginary, as a process, as an apparatus — contributes to the material and epistemic production of DH labs, their spaces, cultures, practices, and products. Our foci in this essay are the disciplinary constructions of the laboratory and its products as epistemic cultures <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and the expansion of the  “situatedness”  of DH labs beyond physical/institutional space to include epistemic, political, sociological, and disciplinary concerns. Rather than narrowly framing labs as spaces of technical production and inquiry, we begin from the premise that laboratory structures and cultures produce specific kinds of knowledge practitioners. These practitioners in turn produce and police the boundaries of legitimate and recognizable knowledge work — including in the Digital Humanities. All of these productions are, in part, results of particular institutional and disciplinary positions, even as they can sometimes be presented as  “matters of fact”   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. An  “opening up”  of the imaginations of how DH situates itself and of how DH practices configure and reconfigure researchers can, in turn, serve as an opening up of new disciplinary, institutional, and political formations of DH knowledge work.</p>
<p>We will make this case by using Science &amp; Technology Studies’ (STS)  “Laboratory Studies”  literature to examine DH labs and their practices, and through illustrations of how the Tactical Humanities Lab (THL), an STS-situated DH lab at Rensselaer, grapples with its own identity, the constructed boundaries of STS and DH, and the social construction of the boundaries of laboratory work. The THL is in many ways an improvised space, operating out of shared spaces and funded by a new professor&rsquo;s startup fund, contrasting with more institutionally supported labs (e.g. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>). With this spirit of relative outsider, the THL operates as an inverse of the typical imagination of the relationship between DH theory and practice. Rather than asking how technical tools can be applied to humanities questions, the THL focuses on how method and inquirer are mutually shaped through research practices, and on how the  “divide”  between technical and interpretive scholarship and methods is a historical and contingent one. This flipped model encourages faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students in the THL to co-theorize about the multiple social constructions of the digital and the virtual in humanistic and social scientific cultures, and to experiment with using DH to produce new situations for social justice.</p>
<h2 id="2-laboratory-studies-and-the-production-of-subjects-and-objects">2. Laboratory Studies and the Production of Subjects and Objects</h2>
<p>Laboratory Studies of the late 1970s/early 1980s represented a seismic shift in the then-still-emerging field of STS. While work in the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK) had been present in British STS circles since the late 1960s <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, SSK had largely focused on the relationships among macro-social and historical narratives and events upon scientific enterprise, particularly in terms of how scientific controversies are created, debated, and resolved. The social, ideological, and historical were either treated as external factors that potentially led to the  “incorrect”  interpretation of work generated by scientific research, or were constructed as variables that intersect with scientific knowledge <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Through the use of ethnographic method, Laboratory Studies focused on scientific work as  <em>in situ</em>  practice, where the wider results of  “science”  were negotiated and produced through the everyday activities of scientific practitioners and knowledge workers. Perhaps the most broadly recognizable early Lab Studies work was Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar’s tracing of knowledge production in Roger Guilleman’s Salk Institute labs in  _Laboratory Life _ (1979). The book would build the foundations for Latour’s later work on Actor-Network Theory (ANT), whose  “flattening”  of the agency of non-humans and things in daily life would become majorly influential both inside and outside of STS circles. The presence of ANT can be seen in DH work <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, flat ontology <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, object-oriented <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, speculative <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, and media archeological <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> literatures.</p>
<p>While ANT’s highlighting of the agency of objects and  “the missing masses”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> is often positioned as a  “counter”  to social constructivist critique of science <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>, STS has tended to treat these approaches as dual components of a broader  “both/and”  analysis of scientific practice <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Object-oriented fans of Latour’s later ANT work may be surprised reading  <em>Laboratory Life</em> , which uses a clearly social constructivist interpretation of scientific practice. Latour and Woolgar conceive of the scientific fact as constructed — not only in terms of the processes of interpretive, interpersonal, and methodological negotiations that occur during research practices, but also in terms of the need for political and social institutions to legitimate scientific knowledge. Though this argument is accused by some of radical postmodernism or correlationism <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> or of denying reality <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, its analytic power has been made even more evident during the US Trump administration. The  “production of ignorance”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> about global warming, for example, is more than just the spread of misinformation and deletion of data. It is also the systematic undermining of the institutions that give scientific facts their legitimacy and political power — universities, government agencies, grant agencies, congressional commissions, educational systems, and the media. From this more relational perspective of ANT/social constructivist approaches, the networks of humans, non-humans, institutions, and infrastructures that produce knowledge appear less like antagonistic or collaborative forces pushing against one another, and more like a mapping of the contingent material and social forces that  “lash-up”  the realities and practices we believe to be concretized <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Further, Latour and Woolgar argue that the construction of scientific knowledge — and in particular, of  “facts”  — socially produces neutrality and objectivity. While the scientific method is far from neutral, and while scientific knowledge workers spend large amounts of time debating and negotiating interpretations of experimental results, these results tend to be reported as objective fact in scientific publications; the rhetorical and epistemological frame of  “facts which speak for themselves.”  In this way, Laboratory Studies scholars argue that the broader institutional, cultural, and political milieus of scientific practice are not the  <em>contexts</em>  of laboratory practices, they are  <em>productions</em>  of those practices. The results, methods, interpretations, and political impact of scientific research are thus co-produced and co-legitimized through the practices of scientific knowledge workers.</p>
<p>The Laboratory Studies of the 1990s would extend the analysis of the laboratory as a site of multi-modal production. Among the most vital work of this era was that of Karin Knorr Cetina, which culminated in the publication of  <em>Epistemic Cultures</em>  in 1999. Knorr Cetina’s research, a comparative analysis of ethnographic experiences at a molecular biology lab and at the CERN High-Energy Physics (HEP) lab, served as a major blow to the  “Unity of Science”  epistemological frame — the idea that all scientific practices are united under a grander methodological and empirical truth, and therefore that all scientific practices, properly arranged, can contribute to an unbroken, consistent accounting for the natural and social world <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Rather, Knorr Cetina argues that different scientific disciplines — and even different localized scientific research apparatuses — produce different epistemic cultures: different ways that knowledge is produced and disseminated, facts and research are legitimized, the  “empirical”  and the  “theoretical”  are defined and related, laboratory apparatuses and equipment are socially constructed, and institutions and structures are built and maintained.  “Science,”  then, is radically disunified — the practices and epistemic frameworks of different scientific knowledge spaces are not interoperable without further interpretive, constructive, and political work, and do not  “add up”  to a unified view of the world. The production of a unified Science is more institutional than it is epistemic, with the separation of the  “objective and neutral”  disciplines from  “softer and interpretive”  ones providing political and ideological legitimacy, often accompanied by larger funding streams and infrastructural support <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Earlier Lab Studies work tended to make agential cuts between the labor of laboratory practitioners and the outcomes of laboratories; i.e., the material and social productions of laboratory work were the results of the collective action of lab workers and the actor-networks of which they were a part. Knorr Cetina, however, argued that the lab workers themselves, subjectively and epistemically, were also products of the laboratory apparatus. The intra-actions <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> of discursive, material, and institutional networks produce laboratory researchers as  “epistemic subjects”   <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, or practitioners attuned to particular ways of knowing, of ways of bounding internal and external disciplinary knowledge, and ways of producing the institutions and infrastructures needed to legitimize that knowledge and its boundaries. Latour and Woolgar’s observations of the production of the  “neutrality”  of a scientific fact can be extended through Knorr Cetina: scientific knowledge workers also co-produce themselves as knowers of  “neutral”  research.</p>
<p>As the identities and subjectivities of scientific practitioners are not pre-given, neither are their objects of study, which Knorr Cetina calls  “epistemic objects”  (1999). Epistemic objects are produced through the boundaries drawn around what makes an object knowable. These boundaries are material and social. Global Warming, for example, can be produced as a scientific object, an economic object, a social object, a political object, and/or a synthesis of any of the prior through the apparatuses enrolled <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> to know and bound it, through the practices of scientists, journalists, politicians, and their interests, and through the theories and technologies of knowing capable or chosen to be deployed. The co-productions of epistemic subjects and objects are not  “just”  rhetorical or framing moves; how we construct the formation of our objects of study and our relationships to them produces lasting and durable infrastructures and institutions of knowledge.</p>
<p>The production of epistemic objects, subjects, and infrastructures transverses and co-produces the boundaries of applied and theoretical work, as well as the boundaries of the physical and the virtual. For example, in her studies of HEP, Knorr Cetina describes how the laboratory apparatus is designed through the co-constructions of the physical high-energy particles and their digital representations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The experiment designs and builds the apparatus in which the particles register. Physicists, however, do not start with the particles, they start with representations of the detector, that is,  “offline”  manipulations of the signals extracted from detectors after data have been taken. This level of representation reconstructs the events in the detector and slowly molds these signals into a form that echoes the particles of interest to physicists.<sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The typical rhetoric of the physical/virtual divide is complicated in laboratory knowledge practices. Rather than the digital representations of particles being  “results”  of physical particles, they are embedded among physical particles and among the epistemic objects of particles, made perceptible by laboratory researchers as epistemic subjects and by the apparatus of which they are a part. The relationship between the laboratory apparatus, the researchers, the material, the discursive, and the virtual, is thus not one of transition between multiple layers, or of a causal chain, but rather is a co-constitutive relationship; they all produce each other, participating in one another’s existence.</p>
<p>1990s Laboratory Studies’ use of ANT and social constructivist models of knowledge production, blended with the concurrent emergence of feminist, cybernetic, and posthuman configurations of subjectivity <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, signaled a shift from first-order cybernetic models of the laboratory, where humans were observers and manipulators of large-scale systems, to second-order cybernetic models <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, where the actants within systems, including humans, are always part of the system itself, and where the  “bounds”  of the system are always under negotiation. Though  <em>Epistemic Cultures</em>  is generally considered to be the last  “mega”  Laboratory Studies work from an empirical perspective — it synthesized over a decade of comparative ethnographic research across multiple laboratories and continents — more recent work in and around Lab Studies has continued its synthetic work on the production of materiality, subjectivity, and epistemology in scientific spaces. Feminist Science Studies and its subset, Feminist New Materialism, have been particularly prominent in the decades since, including the quantum and intra-active theories of Karen Barad <a href="#barad2007">(2007)</a> and the multiply-produced ontologies of Annemarie Mol <a href="#mol2002">(2002)</a>.</p>
<p>While there has been scholarship bridging STS literature with DH practices <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>, much of this writing has focused on labs as imaginaries and as spaces of material and speculative production. More connections can be built between DH’s acknowledgement of the cultural qualities of laboratories and Laboratory Studies’ examinations of the social and material processes that practice those qualities into being. These connections include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An interrogation into methodological and epistemological disunity of Science</li>
<li>The laboratory as a site of social construction of facts, and</li>
<li>The co-production of laboratories, researchers, research objects/subjects, and institutional legitimization</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to highlight these potential connections for two reasons. First, we argue that lack of attention to laboratory practices leads to the stereotyping of scientific and computational practices by DH scholars. In turn, this stereotyping reinforces hegemonic institutions that thrive on the constructed neutrality, rationality, and unity of Science. It can also limit imaginations of when, where, and how DH can intervene in and subvert hegemonic institutions. Second, the social, subjective, political, and epistemological work found in scientific laboratories happens in DH labs as well. The acknowledgement of this work can allow for the reflexive proliferation of more diverse models of DH labs.</p>
<h2 id="3-producing-digital-humanities-laboratories">3. Producing Digital Humanities Laboratories</h2>
<p>How does the construction of Science and scientific laboratories shape DH identity and practices? How do DH Labs produce Digital Humanists as epistemic subjects, and our objects of inquiry as epistemic objects? To begin, the DH Lab produces and is produced by a network of scholars, practices, institutions, epistemologies, ideologies, and cultures of STEM, the Humanities, higher education, and society writ large. And although  “analytic cuts”   <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> are part of the process of making knowable the epistemic object of DH Labs, critically evaluating these cuts can help us to understand how the epistemic subjectivities of DH researchers take part in are co-produced through broader narratives about DH and Science.</p>
<p>Though the genre of  “defining DH”  articles and essays <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> has been criticized as  “absurdly self-referential”   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>, work from Laboratory Studies suggests that the absence of these public debates does not mean that disciplinary boundary constructions are settled. Rather, the lack definitional discourse is a product of the  “making invisible”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> of the debates, interpretations, and legitimizing and de-legitimizing practices that always occur in knowledge production.</p>
<p>Rita Raley describes common attacks on DH as part of a broader criticism of the metrically-oriented university, including arguments that  “quantitative analysis is unthinking and its investments in  precise measurement  hopelessly naive; the epistemological certainty that data visualization seems to offer is equally fantastic”   <sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. While these critiques of quantitative and data cultures are certainly legitimate, they also reinforce the social construction of science as an interpretively naive, yet empirically neutral, knowledge system. We can see some of the issues of this reproduction even in definitional work that supports DH scholarship. James Smithies and Alan Liu have each written about the usefulness — when paired with caution — of scientific and computational methodologies applied to humanities research <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. Similarly, David M. Berry and Anders Fagerjord write:  “There is clearly also a danger for the humanities when their work is seen through the optic of computational approaches. Hence, it is important that digital humanities remains focused on the research questions that are drawn from the humanities, even whilst working in and through computational approaches”   <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This position, that DH practices represent the  “application”  of tools to Humanities questions, is a common one. However, in the co-productive model of knowledge construction, there can never be a separation between the methods we use and the questions we ask. Rather, they are embedded within one another and co-produce each other. Use of these methodologies enrolls broader institutional and epistemological apparatuses when defining  “computational approaches”  or  “humanities questions.”  As a case, we can take the Introduction to Jentery Sayers’s DH course  “Unlearning the Internet”  at the University of Victoria (2018). In the introductory course notes, Sayers explains to his students that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[This] is not a computer science course. The only technical competencies I assume are that you know how to send an email and also check this website. [It] is not about defining  “digital humanities.”  We will treat digital humanities not as a field but as a collection of strategies for conducting humanities research with and through digital technologies. We will emphasize techniques and practices over the use of specific tools and software. <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the epistemological and identity work performed in this syllabus. The descriptor of  “not a computer science course”  is clearly not intended as a disclaimer about the institutional location of the course, but rather as an epistemic claim. Computer Science is constructed as a set of  “technical competencies,”  presumably difficult-to-master ones, in opposition to, or at least orthogonal to, the kinds of knowledge that will be valued in Sayers’s class. The claim of non-definition of DH is followed by a reasonable frame of DH, but one that constructs DH as a collection of practices rather than as a discrete epistemic culture. Finally, the class is positioned as focused on technique and practice rather than on particular digital tools; presumably in opposition to more  “instrumental”  STEM classroom cultures <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The syllabus produces a particular construction of identity, epistemic subjectivity, and disciplinary difference. This production enrolls a variety of constructed facts, including particular imaginations of Computer Science, internal narratives of the strengths of the Humanities, and an anticipation that Humanities students will be intimidated by what they construct as heavily technical work. These facts may be incommensurable with facts from another epistemic culture. For example, despite the common association of Computer Science with toolsets by DH scholars, it would be very outside the norm for Computer Science faculty to frame their course as focused on  “specific tools and software”  rather than on  “techniques and practices”   <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. Similarly, the construction of Computer Science as a technical or instrumental discipline also makes invisible the deeply political and historically contingent dimensions of computer science research practices <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Constructing external disciplinary situatedness such as Computer Science as overly technical and naively instrumental gives other,  “alternative”  technical practices, such as DH, internal social capital. It also serves to construct humanist subjectivity as  “non-technical,”  and therefore erects barriers around what kinds of educational or scholarly practices are imagined as practical or possible. Raley, for example, dismisses a course or curriculum that  “satisfactorily train[s] students in different modes of text analysis… visualization techniques, and GIS, along with… literature and a philosophical approach to informatics”  as  “difficult to imagine.”   <sup id="fnref2:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Ryan Cordell and Rafael Alvarado too argue that the epistemic boundaries of DH are too varied to ever be counted as a discipline, as only a select few polymaths could ever hope to teach or learn such a hybrid cannon <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. The construction of a premade humanist or scientific subjectivity thus forecloses the imagination of what can be produced, sustained, and institutionalized through DH practices.</p>
<p>Digital Humanities labs too can rhetorically reproduce the bounding of technical method and interpretive inquiry. For example, Katy Kavanagh Webb describes a DH lab as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a space that includes technology such as multimedia software and high-powered computers. Some hybrid spaces, such as Georgia State’s CURVE (Collaborative University Research and Visualization Environment) lab, also have visualization screens. Another important aspect of DH labs is the types of meeting and work spaces they can offer to scholars. Duke University even offers lockers where faculty can store research materials. Most DH labs have a strong web presence that showcases the projects that researchers have created. The websites vary from blogs to digital collections (many of them created with Omeka software). <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, UMass Amherst describes their DH lab as  “contain[ing] necessary hardware and software to facilitate the research agendas of the DHI faculty”   (University of Massachusetts). Harvard’s East Asian Digital Humanities Lab  “exhibits ongoing or completed DH projects that can be used as models and provides information about databases, tools and methods that are used in creating these projects,”  and  “&hellip; is arranged according to the usual workflow of digital humanists, starting from finding and managing data and moving subsequently to analysis and presentation”   (Harvard).</p>
<p>Across all of these examples is the reproduction of a practical construction of DH laboratories, and of laboratories in general: as physical or virtual infrastructures that provide equipment or collaboration spaces for researchers. Again, the technical method and inquiry are reproduced as separate: the lab is the site of technology and method, the humanities researcher is the locus of interpretation and inquiry. In this construction, the lab and its technical apparatus becomes framed as passive; as a necessary holding ground for technology and technique, but one that is ultimately a tool at the service of rotating groups of researchers. Laboratory Studies scholars have shown this is not the case. Labs are active spaces, their very presence on campus reshapes expectations for research, the identities of researchers, the imaginations of objects of inquiry, and the legitimization practices for making knowable those objects. A lab space does not emerge out of an epistemically neutral position. The choices to have a DH lab on campus in the first place, how to staff it, how to outfit it, and which faculty and students are imagined as its audience all contribute to broader constructions of scientific and humanistic knowledge work.</p>
<p>DH labs are also responsible for producing their outcomes as  “knowable.”  Labs must contribute to the legitimization of lab practices and material products for particular epistemic cultures in the Humanities. The  “Kits for Cultural History,”  products of Sayers’s University of Victoria Maker Lab <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>, serve as models for thinking through the construction of an epistemic object of DH. Designed as enticing artifacts that allow their users to materially experience media history, each kit contains incomplete reconstructions, archival documents, hidden materials, making tutorials, and reflections about an extant or speculative object. One of the earliest disseminated of these kits was a speculative recreation of Victorian era electro-jewelry, personal wearable technologies, which the authors describe as evoking a sense of wonder and alterity in contemporary viewers. In writeups the kits are described as  “foreground[ing] how the past is interpreted through present conditions… Hidden compartments point to absences in the scholarly record, implying more omissions exist somewhere beyond the container….”   <sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. Jussi Parikka argues that the kits become a  “disjuncture on a time-axis and [work] to enrich the sense of the contemporary as an overlapping set of temporal layers.”   <sup id="fnref2:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, if we assume a non-universality of audience and the general existence of multiple, competing epistemic subjectivities, we must ask: for whom are these kits built, and for whom do they do the critical historical work of interpreting the past, implying omission, and disjuncturing time? The audience who can know the kits as doing this work must be produced; the material arrangements of wood, plastic, and paper of the kits themselves are not enough. The kits are co-produced and situated by their write-ups and their journeys through media. The subjects for whom they are intended, humanities scholars and students, must be produced as epistemic subjects through the interactions of their education, the objects, the field, and the documentary and critical writings about the objects. The lab practitioners at the Maker Lab must be produced as epistemic subjects capable of translating their historical and material negotiations to an imagined external audience. The kits as material artifacts must be co-produced alongside the validity of their interpretive operation. If any of these productions do not occur, the kits do not function; at least, not in the way described by the Parikka and by the Maker Lab. The  “results”  of DH labs are more than virtual and physical objects. Labs produce documentation, contextualization, and subjectification. DH scholars, DH journals, and DH audiences are as much an outcome of laboratory work as any artifact.</p>
<p>DH Labs are therefore not just institutionally or materially situated; they produce situations, and from there, situatedness. Researchers do not interact with lab equipment and personnel and leave unchanged. Rather, researchers become epistemically and subjectively reconfigured within labs, even as they reconfigure and extend the lab. They are produced as a different kind of epistemic subject capable of knowing the world in different ways. DH labs thus operate not only as knowledge structures <sup id="fnref4:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, structuring the methods through which research is conducted and circulated, but also as epistemic infrastructures <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>, producing how researchers ask questions and bound their identities.</p>
<p>DH knowledge workers have constructed a particular onto-epistemic model of their own scholarship and practice, one of the application of  “technology,”  broadly understood, to humanities questions. Acknowledgement of this boundary work is not intended as an attack on DH;  <em>all</em>  knowledge practices create subjects, objects, and boundaries. Rather, we want this critique to serve as an  <em>opening up</em>  of DH practices, and thus of DH labs. As DH labs create situatedness, Humanities scholars can use laboratory spaces and practices as modes of intervention across diverse institutional, epistemological, and disciplinary contexts. These interventions do not have to be constructed as instrumental, as in bringing tools and techniques to  “non-technical”  spaces; nor as evangelical, as in bringing the light of critical inquiry to naive technical practitioners. STS argues that the Sciences should not be constructed as a monolithic, anti-interpretive technical enterprise, but rather a collection of diverse, at times contestational and agonistic, persons, networks, and knowledge practices. What can a similar articulation of DH as contestational, diverse sets of epistemic spaces open up?</p>
<p>Articulating a Disunity of DH alongside the Disunity of Science would impact both the subjectivities of DH practitioners and the situatedness of the DH labs through which we are produced. While the DH work this essay has thus far addressed manifests in more textually-oriented Humanities programs — or, as Kirschenbaum puts it,  “in English Departments”  (2012) — DH could also be constructed as a vehicle for producing knowledge in non-textually dominated humanities fields, or as tactical reconfiguration of non-Humanities fields, including in STEM <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. In the case of synthesizing DH and STS, this would mean undoing some of the present boundary work which has positioned STS as a separate, though allied, disciplinary arena from DH <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Tactical Humanities Lab (THL) at Rensselaer is our effort to epistemically and institutionally produce DH and DH labs as within the boundaries of STS <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. The word  “tactical”  has for us a double meaning. First, it is a recognition of the deployment of the term already in DH, used somewhat flippantly as a way to  “get things done”   <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> in the contemporary university. While we certainly do not support the managerialization of higher education, we believe that  “tactical”  in this sense can be more than just a way of  “accepting [our] parasitic relationship to the host”  of academic administration <sup id="fnref3:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Tactical-as-instrumental can also a way of making humanities and social science research knowable to administrative systems, funding systems, and broader cultural narratives of academic research. In this way,  “tactical”  DH operates as an intra-institutional translational platform <sup id="fnref1:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>, in similar ways that translational medicine practices have been constructed as ways of empathetically bridging biomedical research and diagnostic practices with patients and the public <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. The lab must always acknowledge our situatedness in an engineering-centered institute, where laboratory practices and technoscientific innovation are the major knowable genres for framing social and political change. Our lab meetings consistently evolve into discussions and venting sessions about being humanists and critical theorists in the context of an engineering-centered institute. As such, the THL must be made readable as legitimate knowledge practice to STS and Humanities scholars, and within the framework of a technical university.</p>
<p>Second, we use  “tactical”  in de Certeau&rsquo;s form, as the practice of small-scale, everyday resistances to larger systems of power <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Part of this commitment is disciplinary; STS scholars tend to construct the field as strongly oriented with social justice and normative approaches to scientific, technological, and knowledge practices. We aim not just to change the Humanities and the social sciences, but to change computer science, design, information technology, and biotechnology. This means not only working with self-identified STEM practitioners, but also highlighting–and holding accountable–the epistemic and political frameworks that underpin disciplinary and technical work across STEM and the humanities.</p>
<p>To accomplish these twin goals, the THL takes a bottom-up approach to DH laboratory practices. Rather than having one or two longer-term projects administered through the lab director, graduate and undergraduate students propose semester-long projects to the lab, and are free to work individually or in groups. Though projects can continue for multiple semesters, every semester-length segment is structured via a particular development and dissemination plan. The lab assumes no prior expertise in technical work or critical inquiry; students and faculty share readings, run discussions and workshops, and skillshare throughout the semester. The topics of these workshops and reading groups vary depending on the projects pursued in a given semester. The lab has no formal funding model or physical space — students and student projects are funded through a combination of scrapped-together internal and external sources, including bits and pieces of grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Rensselaer-based internal  “accelerator”  funds, faculty startup funds, Independent Study credits, and preexisting institutional research infrastructures available for supporting undergraduates. Our physical lab presence manifests through distributed temporary spaces, generally either in a conference room outside of Malazita’s office, or throughout various electronics, fabrication, and computer labs on a campus designed for STEM students. In addition to enrolling students from the Humanities, Arts, Sciences, and Engineering across Rensselaer, THL members have also worked to embed themselves back into their home-frameworks with the explicit purpose of bringing this attention to epistemic cultures to research endeavors which may not have initially explicitly valued it. In  “broadening and opening”  our research output <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> we have embraced the shapeshifting nature of our work as evidenced by this attention to the epistemic and brought this internalized understanding of  “tactical”  knowledge production along with us.</p>
<p>The above may sound familiar to many DH laboratory practitioners — especially the contingent funding, space shifting, and sweat equity involved in holding a physically situated research practice together. Building momentum towards continuous operation is also complicated by the term-to-term, student-driven nature of the lab’s research foci. The structure of the lab leads to the production of a wide variety of epistemic subjects and objects. The students and faculty represent multiple disciplines, including STS, Arts, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Sustainability Studies, and Game Design. The project topics range across critical technical education, data visualization, reverse-engineering and hacking hardware, web-based media production, game production, bioart, installation design, and furniture design.</p>
<p>While the array of projects and disciplines can sometimes lead to a feeling of disjointedness at the beginning of the semester, all projects are united by two lab requirements: the projects must be oriented toward a social or political goal, and the research teams should be interested in making their object knowable by DH and STS audiences. Our collective starting point is that  “the digital”  is not a set of tools to be deployed to get social justice done. Rather, the digital, as a coagulation of material, symbolic, and epistemic apparatuses, is entangled with histories of justice, appropriation, resistance, oppression, knowledge-making, agonism, and power. Similarly, the digital is not just a set of material and semiotic systems. It is a pattern of thought that exists as cultural, philosophical, and material practices before and beyond computational systems. As such, it is always ideological, always political, always multiple. Most of our projects are in some way oriented toward deconstructing the digital as an epistemic, ideological, and material concept; building spaces that grapple with translating diverse ways of knowing; hacking existing digital networks to privilege women, PoC, and LGBTQIA+ persons; and re-configuring when, where, and how  “technical”  and  “humanistic”  work happens.</p>
<p>The discussion of making a THL project knowable to diverse epistemic and personal subjectivity is often the most compelling inter-group activity for lab members. Not only does the articulation of a wide variety of activities  “as DH”  and/or  “as STS”  help to build common identity for lab participants, it also gives participants the space to reflect upon how knowledge is produced, bounded, and legitimized in their own fields. This reflective action, ideally, can lead to reflexive action, where THL members can not only better articulate their projects and their impacts to outside audiences, but also imagine the broader array of facts and results that laboratory work produces. In the following sections, we will articulate two of the projects that have emerged from the THL, the  <em>Arbitrary Waveform Generator</em>  and  <em>Politicizing DNA</em> . The  <em>Arbitrary Waveform Generator</em>  sees students hacking, re-wiring, and designing musical synthesizers to better understand the relations between mathematics, history, culture, and sound lashed up in their construction.  <em>Politicizing DNA</em>  uses “the digital” as a metaphor to explore how DNA testing services are rhetorically constructing race and genetic risk in object-oriented ways. Though each project is topically, materially, methodologically, and disciplinarily divergent, each also aims to challenge the epistemic boundaries of digital and non-digital objects, the split between making and interpretive practices, and the epistemic subjectivities of STS and DH knowledge workers.</p>
<h2 id="4-an-arbitrary-waveform-generator">4. An Arbitrary Waveform Generator</h2>
<p>The  <em>Arbitrary Waveform Generator</em>  develops prior theoretical work by Teboul, who, discussing the history of homemade electronic music instruments, argues that  “if most audio devices are a new take on an old concept, then acknowledging lineage is ethically preferable to claiming originality”   <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>. What can we learn from a technical project where the specifications are cultural and contextual in nature, rather than scientific and measurable? Can we design a usable electronic music instrument that doubles as a lesson in music technology history and open source research? With contributions from Emily Yan and Caoilin Ramsay, computer science and electrical engineering undergraduates at Rensselaer, the project explores the use of alternative design parameters in the design and prototyping process of electronic synthesizers. Synthesizers, widely construed, are the electronic devices that generate sound to help today&rsquo;s musician develop their work. They, along with their users, are responsible for a significant portion of contemporary musical production. While most synthesizer designs follow a  “Kit-of-Parts”  approach <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>, where a set of electronic components enable specific sounds at a pre-determined price point, we are building ours to make users reflect upon their own potential as artists, hackers, historians, and anarchivists <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Why attend to social histories when developing a device that assists in musical composition and performance? Audio electronics often combine otherwise  “obsolete”  technologies with newer developments in digital signal processing and integrated circuit designs <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. Modular synthesizers, introduced commercially in the US by Moog and Buchla in the mid 1960&rsquo;s <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> now operate in updated forms alongside software-based synthesizers, themselves descendents of Max Mathews&rsquo; computer music paradigm from the same era <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. These digital relatives for live performance include Max/MSP, Pure Data or Supercollider.</p>
<p>Interfaces that enable the side-by-side, coordinated use of hardware and software devices are, notwithstanding their common origins, relatively rare and expensive. All use proprietary code which makes them relatively expensive and difficult to study. In these technical limitations, related to the historical developments of related inventions, we see an opportunity for productive cultural reflection. We acknowledge that the audio interface we are putting together will encourage some modes of music-making before others. In wondering what the  “best”  way to implement a cheaper, more open source, more versatile and most  “self-aware”  way to do so, we were drawn to two recent devices. The Bela enables a small Linux computer to process many channels of digital audio with no noticeable lag <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. In complement, the arduino-based &ldquo;arbitrary function generator&rdquo; designed by Lawson et al (2016) offers a template for an innovative  “multi-tool”  of sound synthesis. Using the Bela allows us to use Pure data, a visual programming environment for music composition and performance <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>. Pure Data is relatively more accessible and user-readable than C++, the other coding language native to the Bela platform. With those, we are able to interface any computer connected to a local network to any eurorack-format modular synthesizer with a user-editable and performable platform.</p>
<p>Functionally, waveform generator is effectively a programmable oscillator. Because of the physical properties of semiconductors and the history of synthesizers, some waveforms are more common than others: the sine wave, for example, is considered to be the mathematical basis by which all other sound can be reconstructed <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>, whereas the square wave is constructed as the basis of digital communication. These waves’ ubiquity in electronics means they are also responsible for a number of the musical timbres reoccurring in popular music; for example, a very distorted guitar approximates the timbre of a square wave. We play with these norms and expectations in two ways: first, by allowing smooth fades between any pair of those canonical waveforms. Second, by implementing a wavetable, a memory space where the value of each audio sample can be rewritten arbitrarily by the user, for the generation of non-standard waveforms. The choice of coding our audio system with Pure Data, which is almost as easy to modify as it is to use, is made in hopes that future experimenters will feel invited to adapt the system to their needs.</p>
<p>This practical and constructive process is complemented by a deconstructive theory: a  “critical and practical reverse engineering”  that highlights how different devices and different abstractions of devices can be analyzed side-by-side to extract or represent meaning from/in technical decisions. Making is here seen as a lossy type of compression, because less can be retrieved from an artifact than the intellectual and physical resources that have been put into it. History, then, is a process of dealing with the inaccuracies produced in the decompression of this lossy encoding. This dealing is deeply ingrained in the technological archives dear to the project of the humanities. Here, perspectives from critical readings of electronic music and electronic music technology force both a wide construction of the text as including the technological <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>, as well as a reminder that what cannot be encoded has a frictional relationship with text. The Arbitrary Waveform generator is about rendering a multimodal archive operational as a space for lab-based work.</p>
<p>To that end, Ramsay&rsquo;s work has focused on developing the circuits that allow our device to interact with eurorack format modular synthesizers. A first stage involved breadboarded prototypes, in which electronic components are arranged in temporary circuits without soldering, and we are currently moving to a more permanent  “protoboard”  stage for which the functioning circuit is more permanently soldered together. Yan&rsquo;s work has consisted of designing audio programs for composition and performance in Pure Data. These are inspired by the features of Lawson et. al.&rsquo;s original device (2016), that also enabled a connection between software and hardware synthesizers but uses an Arduino and a wavetable with high-resolution samples rather than function calls to iterate the values of a waveform. Yan&rsquo;s software design allows the user to select pairs of the aforementioned  “canonical waveforms”  and either blend them dynamically, affecting timbre. In addition to that, and a wavetable, we are also implementing a sequencer to automate arbitrary changes of these oscillator settings. Teboul&rsquo;s work, expanding from a role of mentoring the undergraduates on technical and interface design requirements of each component, also consists of linking the team&rsquo;s technical decisions to the musical affordances of the prototype, developing documentation of each of these connections and framing them within a critical perspective inspired by Rodgers and Sterne (2011) or Mills (2011) through the extensive use of system diagrams and code commenting. In doing so we develop a practical understanding of electronic music&rsquo;s technoculture <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Group technical work as a method for history is both the concern of STS <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> and of media archeology <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>, but this is also where we build our primary connection to digital humanities generally, and the THL specifically: by operating in the rarefied design space of electronic music, we have a privileged avenue to talk about how arbitrary technical decisions can or should be leveraged to impart meaning to our political artifacts. This is why we complement technical experimentation with critical and cultural research. Each homemade synthesizer is the local reification of the large technocultural system <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup> of electronics and musical production, a fragment through which we can see a partial record of these worlds and what they mean to us. We see this project as offering something new in the context of the digital humanities because although digital tools and associated cultures are an essential aspect, the arbitrary waveform generatormakes obvious that any advantage software and digital signal processing may be able to offer in this context is deeply dependent on both the materiality of the hardware at hand and the sociotechnical context within which it is used.</p>
<p>Reinventing traditional parts of synthesizers in this specifically musical context is a tactic for exposing the politics inherent in every prior instance of these ideas. As such, we do not expect our final prototype to clarify the rich history of do it yourself electronic music instruments through the design of an  “archetypical”  or  “Rosetta Stone”  device; rather, we hope to hint at the complexity of the practice of electronic music, the hundreds of arbitrary or materially-derived decisions in influential past devices as reifications of compositional ideas, and the potential for future technical work to address its own supposedly apolitical nature. In other words, synthesizers, because of their post-optimal nature <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> offer a unique, variably coupled <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup> environment for us to make statements through technical work. The modes of interaction with the device are the result of wondering how material choices help challenge the  “natural”  aspect of our traditional musical assumptions. Helmholtz&rsquo;s theory of sound and of the sine as the basic building block of all complex signals <sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>, is not just the premise for communication theory, but also a significant portion of electronic music making <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>; we are constantly aware that although biases can be challenged in our theories of instrument making, it is in practical use that power relationship are most re-established.</p>
<p>We construe our arbitrary waveform as an ideological object. Wittje <a href="#wittje2016">(2016)</a> and Patteson <a href="#patteson2016">(2016)</a> made clear that the political underpinnings of scientistic approaches to sound most clearly exemplified by Helmholtz&rsquo; work have deep roots in the scientization of acoustic and electrical phenomena in interwar Germany or Europe. Keeping precedents such as those in mind, our work as a team contributes to the slowly growing practice of synthesis as an explicitly political space of experimentation, with the development that statements can be made with technological decisions alongside cultural ones <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This project sits at an uneasy crossroads. We feel the pressure outlined by Brian Massumi in  “On The Superiority of The Analog”   <a href="#massumi2002">(2002)</a>, acknowledging that ultimately we are making a machine for still-analog humans and their perceptual fields. On the other we are equally unsettled by what may seem as a contemporary focus on the digital. This is visible from digital humanities to digital music instruments ( “DMI” , see <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>, the latter of which have come to dominate contemporary instrument making dialog in academia. At no point does our project indicate a clear preference for hardware or software, for computation over critique or vice-versa.</p>
<p>Our status as relative amateurs (this is effectively our first digital music interface project, let alone as a research group) is viewed as a motivation more than a hindrance: the technical issues at hand aren&rsquo;t more difficult than the critical questions we are asking, and therefore we are able to avoid prioritization based on comfort. Echoing the  _Kits for Cultural History _   <sup id="fnref2:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>, we hope to smash the archival and anarchival <sup id="fnref1:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> together, picking up the pieces and documenting them for future reiteration, offering a robust template and solidified framework for a method in the process. In this work, textual commentary emerges as an undertheorized mode of operationalizing both diagrams and interactive visual programming software such as Pure Data. Inspired by this digital culture technique of the  <em>comment</em> , we are in dialog with DH and its artificial boundaries: between analog and digital, between human and nonhuman, between media archeology and platform studies <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>, between engineering and music studies, but always in  <em>practice,</em> and in service of <em>a functional result.</em></p>
<h2 id="5-politicizing-dna">5. Politicizing DNA</h2>
<p>The _ Politicizing DNA _ project analyzes how seemingly objective scientific and genetic data has profound political and social effects on current and future conceptions of race. With the rise of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing, social conceptions of race are brought back into question. By re-inserting the politics of science back into DNA, this project aims to deconstruct the attempts at presenting DNA as unpolitical or neutral. This project seeks to answer how race is constructed within these genetic test kits by reviewing the mission statements, products, and classifications of racial identity of direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies such as 23andMe and the Genographic Project. The project takes a stance of active refusal: the construction of DTC testing as a political knowledge practice rather than as a material practice allows us to engage with DTC without subjecting our own DNA to the laboratories that house and process these genetic tests, and the legal policies that regulate these laboratories.</p>
<p>Given our refusal to take and materially manipulate DTC tests, why are we constructing this project as DH? DNA is constructed as informational in popular culture <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup> and in the laboratory <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>, both of which borrow rhetoric from computational knowledge practices. These constructive practices are common in laboratory settings, where scientific knowledge workers seek to translate their objects of inquiry into information, and in so doing make the objects knowable by the laboratory apparatus <sup id="fnref5:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. For genetics researchers, this construction produces metaphorical, methodological, and ideological assumptions, with the assumption that DNA can be read, coded, and re-coded, and that the relationship between DNA, the body, and the environment is a discrete and networked one, rather than a discursive and ecological one. Though these assumptions have been increasingly challenged <sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>, they have produced decades of research agendas and laboratory infrastructures, including $2.7 billion in public funds dedicated to the Human Genome Project alone <sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As genetic testing rapidly moves from-and-through research labs to consumer spaces, DTC technologies seek to enroll the public in biopolitical practices akin to mass data sousveillance <sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup>, packaging and selling our genetic material back to ourselves. DTC testing services reconfigure mass  “data scraping”  practices into mass  “data swabbing”  practices. Consumers choosing to not take a genetic test or engage with the broader apparatus of genetic testing are making political decisions to deviate from the new normal of circulating and commercially operationalizing genetic data. These choices intersect with gendered and racialized systems of digital and genetic surveillance, including onto-epistemic <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> systems of classification, identity, and belonging that structure the lives and digital experiences of marginalized people <sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Spearheaded by Rafeh and undergraduate researchers Paloma Alonso and Hannah Lightner, the  _Politicizing DNA _ project has thus far centered the mediated constructions of DNA, race, and identity with-and-through digital infrastructures. The  <em>Politicizing DNA</em>  team is comprised of women and women of color, particularly rare in an institute like Rensselaer that is majority white and male. This intentional structuring of the project team produces a unique situatedness for the lab, as it recognizes that the positionality of the researchers in a lab co-constructs the kinds of questions asked, the ways in which the epistemic object is bounded, and what counts as legitimate discourse. That women and women of color are investigating DTC genetics is particularly important, due to the history of exclusionary, exploitative, and oppressive practices in medicine and healthcare <sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup>. This type of politically situated lab structure reinforces the research group&rsquo;s work of politicizing formerly depoliticized scientific processes.</p>
<p>Of primary analysis was the construction of the relationships between genetics and identity through DTC’s public-facing documents. These documents primarily included websites (including <a href="http://www.23andme.com">23andme.com</a>, <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/">ancestry.com</a>, <a href="https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/">genographic.nationalgeographic.com/</a>, and africanancestry.com), but also included archival materials such as FDA regulatory decisions, Terms-of-Service contracts, and popular coverage of DTC tests in media. Public understandings of the gene cyclically influence, and are influenced by, scientific understanding of the gene <sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup>. At the same time, the epistemic object of the gene known by the public is a different artefact than the gene as multiply constructed by the scientific community <sup id="fnref1:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup>. These differences include how scientific achievements are promoted in the public as more significant or advanced than stated in publications.</p>
<p>These different meanings continue to disassemble the idea that  “science”  is apolitical, or separate from social influence. The public fascination with DNA orients the scientific community just as much as the scientific community orients public fascination. For example, when a lab does publicly engage with the politics of DNA, it is often done in a way that leverages Enlightenment narratives of the public good of scientific enterprise, rather than addressing genetic sciences’ history of oppression and abuse, particularly of women and women of color. This follows the prioritization of scientific research over the understanding of the political and social meanings it has in the world for multiple epistemic subjectivities.</p>
<p>Contrary to much DH research, the  <em>Politicizing DNA</em>  project employs close reading rather than distant reading to develop hermeneutic analyses of the digital object of DNA as constructed through corporate websites. The researchers weren&rsquo;t just tasked to look at language frequency or presence/absence, but also to interpret how each company chose to publicly engage with the intersections of race, identity, and DNA. This included both a rhetorical analysis, how these concepts were deployed or not deployed in text, and also a situational analysis, such as whether or not identity content was included in advertising materials, terms and conditions, or legal documentation. Each of these digital-textual formats are governed by different legal standards, giving implied and explicit meanings behind the words companies chose to use.</p>
<p>Given the lingering presence of the  “hack vs. yack”  debates of the mid-2010s in DH research communities <sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup>, the lack of technical sophistication or use of manual analysis over programming may lead to some scholars to construct  <em>Politicizing DNA</em>  as outside the bounds of DH. However, we argue that the project’s methodology deeply engages  “the digital,”  deploying a rhetorical and archeological trancing of a digital object across multiple digital media, and as it intersects with legal apparatuses, identity, and materiality. After the initial swabbing test kit that consumers receive and return to DTC genetics companies, the entirety of the consumer-facing genetic test experience is digital. The materiality of DNA has been transformed into a digital experience.</p>
<p>While Berry and Fagerjord argue that  “the question of whether something is or is not  digital  will be increasingly secondary as many forms of culture become mediated, produced, accessed, distributed or consumed through digital devices and technologies”   <sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>, the  _Politicizing DNA _ project provides an alternative critique of the humanities/technology divide. Further, by constructing this project as DH, we are arguing that asking whether something  “is digital”  is not a question of technicity or mediation. Rather, it is an ideological and political question, one whose answer enrolls an array of knowledge systems, normative concerns, market logics, and institutional apparatuses. Claiming DNA as digital subsumes it into a larger infrastructures of data processing and computational culture. Similarly, claiming the analysis of DTC DNA testing and its rhetoric as DH allows us to enroll larger systems of analysis and interpretation that highlight DNA as a transitory object among wet and digital bodies.</p>
<p>Lab work has thus far uncovered ill-defined terminology and unfeasible promises of ancestry on these companies’ websites. The websites of DTC genetic test companies do not explicitly discuss race, and instead use wording such as  “ancestry”  or  “population groups” . Our results have shown how race and ethnicity are subjective terms exploited by DTC genetic testing websites. This exploitation has been evident through websites’ ill-defined terminology and unfeasible promises of ancestry. For example, instead of using race, the three genetic companies use the terms  “ethnic groups and tribes,”    “populations,”  and  “ethnic populations.”</p>
<p>Even though the companies don’t talk about race, DTC genetic tests are used to confirm, deny, or discover racial identities. DTC tests have direct ramifications among several groups of people, including white nationalists <sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup>, African Americans <sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup>, and Native Americans <sup id="fnref1:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>, engaging with popular conceptions of what it means to be Black, white or Native. Incidentally, the only website to explicitly discuss race was AfricanAncestry. In their FAQ section of their website, they answer the question  “Can a DNA analysis identify my racial or ethnic identity?”  with:  “There is no test for racial identification. Race is a social construct, not genetically determined. Similarly, ethnicity is more cultural than biological”  (<a href="https://africanancestry.com/home/">africanancestry.com</a>). Not only is it poignant that a DTC genetic ancestry company provides this kind of answer that reflects scholarship in social studies of science, but it is also interesting that the only company that centers itself on ethnic identity also provides information on the social construct of race.</p>
<p>Though  <em>Politicizing DNA</em>  is still in early stages, we hope that our findings will contribute to the public understanding of genetics by analyzing the accessibility and representation of genetic information as it affects the public’s perceptions of genetics and race. The ultimate goal of this study was to examine the portrayal of race and ancestry in DTC genetic tests by asking how do DTC genetic testing companies classify people into different groups based on ancestry, ethnicity, and race.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Constructing laboratories as epistemic infrastructures that produce epistemic subjects, objects, and cultures destabilizes current imaginations of DH practice. While DH labs are often framed as semi-passive resource spaces, where students and faculty can access equipment, trained staff, and research infrastructures, we have argued that labs are instead epistemically active spaces. DH labs produce the epistemic subjectivities of researchers, the textures and boundaries of the objects made knowable by the lab, and the material-discursive practices that make legitimate DH research.</p>
<p>This reconstruction of laboratories, and of DH labs in particular, brings with it epistemic opportunities. If the boundaries of DH work are produced through particular imaginations of science and scientific practice, through imaginations of the abstracted  “user”  of DH spaces, then the shifting of that imaginative landscape can have tremendous impact upon the shapes and structures of DH labs. These impacts may include alternative models of laboratory work, alternative disciplinary spaces where DH work can be practiced, and alternative objects of DH research. Alternative knowledge practices lead to alternative epistemic subjects, new bodies of theory, shifting infrastructural and institutional terrain, and may move us toward a more  “radical, unrealized potential”   <sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup> of DH.</p>
<p>For the Tactical Humanities Lab, this potential includes the expansion of disciplinary and epistemic situatedness beyond textually-based humanities into the humanistic social sciences, cultural studies, and STEM. The THL is one possible configuration of DH that could emerge, one that focuses on the construction of the boundaries of technical and interpretive work, and on the production of DH knowledge and subjectivity through technical work, written argumentation, and labor practices. While this is certainly not the only form DH could take when reading-through STS knowledge practices, and while there are countless other disciplines through which DH could be co-constructed, we offer the THL as an alternative to the tool/application centeredness that dominates contemporary narratives of the digital humanities, and as an alternative for imagining when, where, and for whom DH knowledge practices can happen.</p>

<p>A historic reading room from 1931 is the site of one of the newest scholarly support environments at Yale University: The Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory. While neither the first renovation of the space — the room shifted from reserve books to periodicals in the 1970s — nor the first home of the lab, which relocated from a room requiring a campus ID for access to a publicly accessible, much larger space — the transition of a reading room to a digital humanities (DH) laboratory represented a new kind of commitment from the Library that required structural, aesthetic, and programmatic transformations. The goal was to create a collaborative, open workspace where the practice of digital humanities would be visible, accessible, and supported within Sterling Memorial Library, the so-named  “heart of the university”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Specific design and policy interventions informed the reimagining of this central and symbolic space. This article considers the role of DH labs as  “humanities infrastructure,”  with a focus on how location, materials, and services could be designed to support DH research and training within libraries.</p>
<p>The transformation of this particular room, and the services found inside it, are part of a larger process of libraries formalizing their support for digital humanities in response to local needs and resourcing <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. As staff members in Yale University Library and DH practitioners ourselves, we chronicle the project from the perspective of both library service design and new forms of academic collaboration. Ethnographic study, user-centered design, and a focus on the materiality of both physical and digital collections combine to suggest one pathway for research libraries to create spaces that offer localized support for collaborative digital work in the humanities.</p>

<p>In the 2019  <em>Debates in Digital Humanities</em> , Neil Fraistat calls for a reimagining of lab programming, one that moves away from faculty fellowships toward incubator models that provide more training and capacity-building support <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. We extend this call to consider how the physical design of labs contributes to the services offered therein. Many universities and colleges have built successful models where a DH lab or center is affiliated with a single department or faculty lead: Stanford’s Literary Lab was at one point physically housed within the English department, for example. More and more, however, labs are forming within libraries. Joan Lippincott observes that  “more libraries are recognizing that they may want to invest resources, including staff expertise and time, technology infrastructure such as repositories, and physical spaces such as digital scholarship centers or labs, to make a more formal commitment by the library to this type of scholarship”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This extension of library support for digital training spans the United States, with examples from the University of California Los Angeles, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Rutgers University, University of Virginia, and Brown University, to name a few. But even within libraries, the focus and design of labs vary. Katy Kavanagh Webb’s recent survey of digital support separates labs into groups covering Digital Media, Digital Humanities, Data Visualization, and Makerspaces (2018), each of which has its own spatial constraints with respect to the kind and amount of hardware needed, which in turn affects its design flexibility.</p>
<p>At Yale, the Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) has always been physically and organizationally located within the Library, tasked from the beginning with supporting scholarship across the humanities broadly considered. In addition to departmental diversity, the audience for DH support has included a broad set of clients, from Yale College students, graduate students, faculty, curators, and librarians to occasional collaborations with external partners. This range of disciplinary and professional perspectives presented unique opportunities and challenges for designing a space that would be inspiring, inclusive, and functional.</p>
<p>Moving DH labs into libraries invites a rethinking of library spaces that were originally designed for oftentimes siloed engagements. Completed in 1931, Sterling Memorial Library contains nearly 450,000 square feet of space to support learning and research. Positioned immediately to the left of the main entrance, the Reserve Book Room (Figure 2) was an integral part of architect James Gamble Rogers’ design. The room and its support areas total over 4,000 square feet and were designed to hold 10,000 volumes on wooden shelves that flank the northwest and southeast walls. Large expanses of leaded glass windows bring filtered natural light into the room, rising to a ceiling of decorative plasterwork and chandeliers. The abundance of craftsmanship is characteristic of Sterling Memorial Library as a whole, completed at a time when the Great Depression enabled new campus construction nationwide at relatively low cost. Yet the Reserve Room itself was described by contemporary observers as a place of relative moderation:  “Inasmuch as the Reserve Book Room is really a work room where students go for study,”  wrote alum Ellery Husted in the  <em>Yale Library Gazette</em>  the year of Sterling’s opening,  “its architectural treatment is more restrained”  than the other large reading rooms which filled the main floor of the new library <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The Reserve Book Room served its role as designed well into the 1970s, when the construction of the new underground Cross-Campus Library (now renamed Bass Library) opened up more modern space for perusal of reserved books. As a result, in 1973, the room changed its function to housing periodicals, continuing in that capacity through a renovation in the late 1990s that included new furniture and a renaming to the Franke Family Reading Room in honor of a gift from Barbara and Richard Franke (Class of 1953), who share a longtime commitment to supporting the humanities.</p>
<p>By the early 2010s, consensus had built on campus that the room could serve a more prominent role in the future of research in the arts and humanities. With the availability of other rooms within Sterling to hold print periodicals, the space seemed ripe for reimagination. Discussions imagined a Digital Center for Arts and Humanities, modeled on the successful launch of the Center for Science and Social Science Information (CSSSI) in a 1960s building in 2012 <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. That renovation project successfully provided a home for the science and science libraries, 24-hour study space, and support for data analysis in the basement of a science building. Subject specialists in that new space worked in glass offices surrounding a central collaborative work area, where advanced statistical consulting was also provided by graduate students. CSSSI thus provided a new template at Yale for how subject specialists, technology, and data services could complement traditional library offerings such as print collections and periodicals. The challenge was how to adapt this support model for a significantly older, and less flexible, space.</p>
<p>Indeed, the design and materiality of the Franke Room was naturally much different than the 1960s environment in which CSSSI was built. Instead of the basement of a mid-century building, the Franke Room contained wooden carvings, leaded glass, and plasterwork designed to evoke the early English Renaissance. Built-in bookcases lined the room up to a height of nine feet, transitioning to walls that were designed to appear uneven, as if finished by hand.</p>
<p>At the same time, the integration of the Franke Room into the architectural and material fabric of Sterling Memorial Library also offered advantages (Figure 3). In contrast to the disciplinary-specific reading rooms on higher floors (and behind access gates that require Yale IDs), the Franke Room is near the main entrance on the ground floor, open and accessible to all, making it a strong candidate for a large and welcoming space designated for the exploration of new ideas and methods.</p>
<p>As a design team of architects and library staff examined the room’s complex materials and physical adjacencies, several intriguing possibilities emerged. Given the room’s close proximity to the library’s physical collections, the reimagined space could position DH as contiguous with older traditions of humanities research rather than a radical break from it. The presence of a substantial print collection in the building could serve as a reminder that the root material for many digital projects is the print book or periodical. From a workflow perspective, this proximity could also streamline the research process: if the lab had equipment available for digitization, researchers could pull books from the stacks and bring them straight to the lab where they could transform them into machine-actionable data.</p>

<p>The original infrastructure of the room also contained large amounts of hidden reserve book shelving behind a long, adjacent wall that was accessible only to library staff. The design of the DHLab re-imagined this back-of-house area, opening it up to support collaborative meeting spaces and on-site offices for lab staff. The 1930s ideal of hiding the mechanical aspects of scholarly support space would give way to exposing this previously backstage area to the patrons in the main room.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-gathering-identifying-and-responding-to-local-needs">Requirements Gathering: Identifying and Responding to Local Needs</h2>
<p>Planning for DH support at Yale coalesced in the early 2010s, ranging from conferences <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> to graduate student-led working groups and informal committees. (For an overview of reactions to this effort, see <a href="#svensson2012">Svensson 2012</a>.) The Library first advertised a Librarian for Digital Humanities Research in the late 2000s, but did not fill the position until 2013. Throughout this time period, graduate students, librarians, IT staff, and faculty continued to advocate for more structured support — along with dedicated space — for DH inside the library. These conversations were focused into an informal committee led by the Deputy Provost for Humanities and Initiatives, resulting in, among other things, a comprehensive survey of faculty and graduate students who self-identified as having DH interests. This report <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> was essential in cataloging and characterizing the ways that scholars on campus wished to combine humanistic inquiry with new digital techniques, and it laid the groundwork for coordinated effort to further Yale’s support for scholarship in this area. In 2015, Yale University Library received support from The Goizueta Foundation to inaugurate a comprehensive initiative in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education by launching the DHLab <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Recognizing the Franke Family Reading Room as a natural home for the new initiative, the Library began a multi-year design process with student, faculty, and staff stakeholders to identify campus needs and aspirations for DH support, which would inform the design of the space.</p>
<p>Whereas the sciences have long-established models for constructing lab spaces outfitted to their research needs, the humanities have operated more in a tradition of individual work. DH labs create opportunities for collaborative work that brings together different sets of expertise and equipment to pursue humanistic inquiries at varying scales. The challenge in designing such a space revolves, in part, around striking the right balance between different needs and possibilities. For example, should the room be a fully open workspace, or should it provide areas explicitly marked out for different functions? Which is more likely to spur activity: a space of unstructured possibility, or one that actively suggests particular modes of engagement? Is a computer with a large monitor actively displaying an interactive visualization more, or less welcoming, than an open table? In describing Penn Libraries’ integration of DH, Anu Vedantham and Dot Porter underscore that  “[s]paces designed to encourage brainstorming and discussion need to look, feel, and function differently from those designed to support deep reading, note taking, writing, or presentation practice”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Connected with the desired activity of the space, however, is the overhead required to maintain it, from both a staffing and budgetary consideration. What happens when the computer needs replacement – much sooner than the table? Who will produce and update the content displaying on the digital screens?</p>
<p>A workspace unencumbered by machines affords different kinds of engagement with a space and the people inside it than does one filled with monitors. The computer lab concept, with rows of fixed workstations, seemed to the design team to belong to an older model, which was confirmed by site visits to newly designed spaces that were more flexible in their layout, with some equipment balanced by open workspaces (Northeastern, Brown, and others). In their 2015 survey  <em>Building Expertise to Support Digital Scholarship: a Global Perspective</em>  for CLIR, Lewis et al.  “noted variation in the kind of  <em>facilities</em>  these organizations occupied; collaborative space seemed to be more important than top-notch hardware”   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Columbia University’s  <em>Studio@Butler</em> , for example, launched in 2013 with an explicit goal to de-emphasize computing equipment in the service of foregrounding human collaboration <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. At the same time, access to specialized hardware and software normally out of the reach of students can lower barriers to casual experimentation and initial engagement with digital forms of scholarship. The question seems to be, then, what percentage of the room should equipment (computers, scanners, virtual reality headsets, 3D printers) occupy?</p>
<p>To acknowledge, anticipate, and address, the specific DH needs on our campus, the Library engaged design anthropologist Nancy Fried Foster, formerly the senior anthropologist at Ithaka S+R, for an information-gathering phase during which she helped collect input from the Yale community. With Fried Foster, the design team conducted interviews during 2016 with current clients of the DHLab, as well as those who had not used such services in the past. The goal of including researchers who did not identify as digital humanists was to ensure that the design team did not overfit the service portfolio and architectural design to those who had already availed themselves of DH support services on campus. Fried Foster describes the user-centered design process as one that  “begins with an understanding of work practices and obstacles and then designs solutions to support workflows and address identified problems. It is inclusive and participatory, and is intended to improve outcomes by building a foundation of valid, up-to-date information about the community for use by designers and architects”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. This phase of information gathering was critical for grounding our assumptions of scholars’ spatial and technical needs with respect to DH research. The user-driven assessment included three types of engagements:<br>
in-person interviews with students, faculty, and staff from different disciplinary backgrounds — though predominantly from the humanities — many of whom had been involved in DH activities on campus in some way, whether that meant they attended workshops, came in for consultations, or had their own projects underway (for more on the interview process, see  “Library Design and Ethnography” , which describes a comparable information-gathering process at the University of Rochester <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>).  design workshops during which participants were asked to imagine different spatial, personnel, and technical configurations of the DHLab, and   benchmarking research informed by colleagues’ experiences at other institutions via site visits, Skype conversations, and reading.</p>
<p>The design workshops were particularly illuminating for seeing how researchers imagined engaging with the new space. The first workshop asked participants to draw their ideal spaces, including what technology they would like to see in the room and what sort of activities should be supported. The outputs from the first workshop became the basis for the second workshop, which took the list of imagined equipment and activities that might take place in the space (such as designated workshop areas, staff offices, desktop computers, flexible workstations, reception desks) and printed them on separate strips of papers. Participants then arranged those pieces of paper around a space roughly scaled to the Franke Room. Each strip had multiple copies so that if, for instance, a participant thought there should be five desktop computers and two workshop areas, they could arrange the room accordingly. There was no requirement that participants use strips from all of the different resource or activity types.</p>
<p>Patterns from the sessions helped inform priorities for the renovation, including the need for separate programmatic spaces for consultations, collaborative work, and project exhibitions. Participants wanted to have ready access to DHLab staff, but they recognized the need for staff to have occasional privacy as well. Large display screens emerged as a significant request for both collaborative work and exhibitions, which drove conversations among the design team toward the notion of a large-scale data canvas as a possibility for visualizations. Meanwhile, conventional desktop machines were lower on the list of must-have equipment: most students, faculty, and staff preferred working from their own laptops, but they acknowledged that a few high-end desktop computers in the DHLab would be helpful for accessing software and for more computationally intensive projects.</p>
<p>While the feedback received during the information-gathering phase was generally consistent, Fried Foster’s summative report <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> indicated a few trends that appeared specific to university affiliation: faculty expressed the most interest in defining the DH as a field, graduate students engaged the most with DHLab activities (training and funding opportunities, sponsored talks, projects), and undergraduates displayed the most curiosity and willingness to experiment, as well as the strongest interest in combining the Arts and Humanities and STEM (a concept denoted on campus as STEAM). Providing insight into researchers’ expectations and work practices, the formal information-gathering phase shaped subsequent conversations with architects over how to optimize the Franke Room to serve DH scholars on campus.</p>
<p>During the time that design team was gathering requirements and beginning the architectural rendering process, the newly-formed DHLab — consisting of a Director (formerly the Digital Humanities Librarian) and the newly hired Engagement and Outreach Manager, User Experience Designer, and Digital Humanities Developer — began work in the repurposed rooms on the third floor. The constraints and opportunities of this temporary space led to several lessons that would, coupled with the design team’s assessment, inform the eventual design of the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory. In particular, the team learned that placing its reference print collection of DH books on the old wooden shelves started innumerable conversations with curious visitors as well as clients who made appointments to meet with staff or other collaborators. As every book was placed on a metal stand that displayed its cover to onlookers, the breadth and diversity of scholarly publications in titles as  <em>Music Data Mining</em>   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> and  <em>Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature</em>   <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> spurred conversation and thought even among self-professed DH skeptics. In addition to theoretical and practical books on DH methodologies, the Lab also selected critical texts that sought to cast a complicating light on the larger, current Big Data moment:  <em>The Master Algorithm</em>   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>,  <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em>   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>,  <em>Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism</em>   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>,  <em>How to Lie with Maps</em>   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, and  <em>New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and Pedagogy</em>   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> were among the titles that sought to bring nuance and different perspectives to scholarly conversations around digital approaches. The oldest book on the DHLab’s shelf reflected the uncertainty for how computational methods would (or would not) be incorporated into humanistic pursuits:  <em>Computers for the Humanities?</em>  (1965) contains the proceedings of a conference held on Yale’s campus, with the sponsorship of IBM, with the terminal punctuation mark still an area of active debate amongst humanists and digital humanists alike. Having  <em>Computers for the Humanities?</em>  on the shelf of the DHLab creates a connection between Yale’s early, little known — even to us — interest in how the humanities would take up computation, and its present-day, expanded commitment to providing support for DH research and teaching.</p>

<h2 id="service-points">Service Points</h2>
<p>Serving as a focal point for — and for many, an introduction to — DH on campus, it is especially important for labs to be inviting, inclusive spaces, welcoming to long-standing DH practitioners, the curious but unsure, and everyone in between. In conceptualizing the layout of the space (Figure 4), the team advocated for modular designs that would support multiple kinds of DH engagements. DH is a robust, rapidly developing area of research and teaching, and the goal was to design a space that could respond to new needs and forms of collaboration that might surface. Nearly half of the DHLab would thus consist of an open workspace occupied only by wheeled tables and chairs. The tables, which can be linked together at the ends, can be easily reconfigured into pod formations, long rows, or U-shapes to support workshops, presentations, working groups, collaborations, and individuals working on laptops or reading books. Walls would feature alternating panels that incorporated both print book collections and digital visualization monitors.</p>
<p>One service point with a track record of inspiring initial conversations was the print book collection that had lined the shelves of the temporary space. The team wanted to expand and highlight this collection in the new, larger room — gesturing towards the original function of the space. With new support from central Collection Development funds, the books became a consistently growing resource — as well as a dramatic visual characteristic of the space. The collection was ingested into the central Yale Library catalog thanks to the work of the Technical Services team, who adjusted their workflow to accommodate call letter labels that would not obscure cover designs and who added custom bookplates designed by the User Experience specialist in the DHLab. In the higher-profile location along the walls of the renovated room, the books encourage patrons to take up theoretical debates in the field, develop specific coding skills for their research, or read up on DH applications within specific disciplines.</p>
<p>Thematically organized, the books provide a snapshot view of the four DH areas the DHLab is most equipped to support (text, image, network, and spatial analysis), in addition to highlighting several books on data visualization, web development, and the DH field at large. The goal for the collection is for it to be a resource to which scholars can turn for instruction and inspiration. With the increasing uptake in e-resources and library services where books can be pulled from the shelves for patrons, there is less browsing — and by extension, fewer unanticipated connections being made — in the stacks. To stimulate engagement with the DHLab’s print collection, the architects designed slanted shelves that could display books covers facing out, as the DHLab team learned from the temporary space that researchers coming to the lab for a table to work at might also find themselves drawn toward a book on telling stories with data visualizations.</p>
<p>A challenge but also affordance of an open workspace is the lack of sound barriers. While the sound carryover can be distracting for work that requires intense concentration, it also opens up the possibility for serendipitous connections. Organic collaborations, as the DHLab witnessed in the temporary space, often form in such communal spaces, where a group working on a given project realizes they had something to offer a group working on a different effort and vice versa because of overheard conversations. In this way, the team hopes that the opportunity for collaborations encouraged by the open nature of the room outweigh any disadvantage from sound travel.</p>
<p>Despite the attention paid to collaboration in library design, a significant fraction of DH activity occurs as an individual activity. This consideration emerged during the information-gathering phase, with participants requesting a space where they might, as Fried Foster described it, work  “alone together”   <sup id="fnref2:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Individuals working in the space want to be able to focus on their own projects at the same time that they want to be a part of the energy growing around DH on campus. The team wanted to ensure that scholars working on their own could find places in the room that supported their needs for privacy and concentration. The flexible table arrangement in the front portion of the room and the relaxed but more isolated furniture in the back enables researchers to reconfigure the space and find a seating option that works for them.</p>
<p>Sterling Memorial Library contains a multitude of dedicated quiet spaces for solitary research; what it has fewer of are designated collaborative discussion spaces where researchers can analyze, debate, and discover out loud. Fried Foster’s report reflects this need as well, with students, faculty, and staff expressing the expectation that the DHLab would be a space  “conducive to interaction and the sharing of ideas and information. They envision an environment in which seeing others, working in company, and finding opportunities to talk will foster serendipitous connections”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. To identify the renovated space as one that not only allows but welcomes conversations, a floor-standing stanchion positioned exactly in the middle of the front entrance doorway explicitly informs those who enter the space of this expectation.</p>
<p>But an effective discussion space requires more than just encouragement to talk out loud. Certain kinds of furniture are more conductive than others to grouping around a text or computer screen. The architects, who were provided with a copy of Fried Foster’s 2016 report and who met regularly with DHLab and Library staff, were mindful of the kinds of engagements that might take place in different quadrants of the space when they made their furniture recommendations. Ergonomic considerations, such as whether chairs in front of computers should have armrests or not, together with a focus on accessibility for patrons using mobility devices, informed the choice of furniture and surfaces in the space.</p>
<p>Teaching workshops in an open space rather than a computer lab offers serious advantages as well as disadvantages that must be taken into account when determining the layout and equipment for a DH lab. To begin with the disadvantages, participants are required to bring a computer with them, and not everyone has access to a personal laptop. Many libraries have laptop checkouts available to students, faculty, and staff; however, they do not usually grant administrative access, meaning participants would be unable to download any software. Tablets can also be insufficient substitutes for laptops when it comes to certain software. Even for the participants who can bring laptops over which they have administrative control, other challenges emerge. Personal laptops can be slow, low on memory, limited in storage space, and/or suffer from low battery capacity, which can pose a problem depending on where and how many outlets are in the space.</p>
<p>Conversely, these latter disadvantages point to some of the benefits of participants working from their own machines. Since installations can be quirky and setting up software environments daunting and confusing, it can be helpful for participants to walk through the process with an instructor. If they’re able to get everything up and running during the workshop, they can then leave it and continue practicing without having to learn first how to install everything from scratch by themselves. This is why Software Carpentry, of which Yale Library is affiliated through the New England Software Carpentry Library Consortium (NESCLiC), operates under the expectation that participants will work from their own machines.</p>
<p>Hosting workshops in an open space also yields a more collaborative environment. Rather than being hidden by monitors, participants can see one another, along with the instructor. Additionally, anyone working in other sections of the DHLab can also see and hear the workshop. While workshop registration is capped at a manageable number, the open space provides an opportunity for those who did not register to listen in and, if they are so inclined, to follow along on their own laptops.</p>
<h2 id="security-and-transparency-the-special-projects-cube">Security and Transparency: The Special Projects Cube</h2>
<p>Efforts to ensure that the work of DH had a place in the room led to discussion of how to best highlight the specialized equipment and activities that characterizes some (but not all) of this newer form of humanities research. Fried Foster’s final assessment report captures that much of the on-campus excitement for a dedicated space for DH emerged from the hope that the space might catalyze new work by making DH research visible. In the report, Fried Foster notes that researchers  “want the set-up of the space to build excitement and stimulate new work; [students, faculty, and staff] see this supported through exhibits, displays, books, and perhaps even a museum, of projects, artifacts, images, and sounds. Displays and exhibits should be visible throughout the space and include screens”   <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In some cases, the specialized nature DH equipment created conditions requiring a secured space. The glass Special Projects Cube seeks to fulfill that requirement while still making DH practice visible. One half of the cube includes equipment for transforming print materials into machine-actionable corpora, while the other half includes machines geared toward high-performance computing. Researchers passing through one end of the lab to the other can see the labor involved in running a collection of texts through optical character recognition (OCR) software or generating scripts to process thousands of images.</p>
<p>Scholars have been duplicating library material at self-service copiers for decades, subject to the fair use provisions of US copyright laws. But advanced text-mining projects call for a more comprehensive approach: the transformation of physical collections into digitally-actionable research objects. For this reason, the Special Projects Cube includes book- and microfilm scanners to aid humanists in the creation of textual corpora. Crucially, this research digitization practice is not about the reproduction or preservation of an original material object: in most cases, the scanned images are discarded as soon as the textual extraction process is complete, leaving only a transformed digital text.</p>
<p>The bound volume is of course not the only form of raw material: Sterling Memorial Library’s microfilm collections is large, but often under-utilized due to difficulties in handling and extracting the thousands of images often present on each reel. The DHLab, in conjunction with other library departments, installed a microfilm scanner capable of extracting documents from microfilm reels more efficiently. The resulting images, segmented by a machine vision algorithm, can then processed through OCR software installed on the DHLab’s machines to create a textual corpus for later analysis.</p>
<h2 id="materiality-and-view-corridors">Materiality and View Corridors</h2>
<p>One of the aesthetic challenges that emerged during the information-gathering phase was how to incorporate old furnishings with new technologies. The Yale researchers who participated in our process indicated a preference for modern equipment alongside a desire to retain a feel for the a library setting. The design team knew that preserving the character of the room would thus be essential. The architects did make two changes to bookcases: re-orienting the shelves to display book covers facing outwards, and installing digital screens carefully-matched to the scale and structure of the bookcases, flush with the wall envelope. The result was an updated look for the room without changing the fundamental geometry or finishes.</p>
<p>The orientation of the room along a long axis is reinforced by the way that patrons enter at one end: the foyer has a much lower ceiling that creates a sense of compression. Proceeding into the room itself draws the eyes forward to large windows on the far wall. Subdividing the space with any materials or objects that blocked this axial view would fundamentally change the room and the experience of entering it. A key design priority was thus to preserve as much of the view corridor throughout the room as possible. This dictated the dimensions and placement of the Special Projects Cube, which is located offset from the center of the space but directly in the line of view of a patron entering the room (Figure 3). The surfaces of the cube are made of glass, which allows the transmission of light and motion from all directions. In addition, the intervention of a semi-transparent object in the middle of the room heightens the visual drama of the space, as viewers have both a filtered view of the length of the room, and the people working in the cube.</p>
<h2 id="staff-spaces">Staff Spaces</h2>
<p>The fact that DHLab staff, in the temporary space on the third floor, worked in an open environment right beside computer workstations meant we experienced auditory interference from overheard conversations, along with a constant sense of being on call for impromptu tech support. On the one hand, this arrangement provided valuable insights into the projects people were taking on and the technical or methodological difficulties they were encountering. On the other hand, it meant that professional staff might be interrupted at any moment and pulled away from other support efforts that required sustained concentration.</p>
<p>For the renovation, the DHLab staff wanted to retain awareness of the kinds of work clients were doing in the space, along with being visible ourselves so that we could provide support, but we (as well as the faculty and students Fried Foster interviewed) also recognized the need to work quietly without interruption at times. The final design result was to locate the staff offices along the periphery of the main space, with a glass wall on the one side that faces the space, thereby enabling staff to see out and researchers to see in. An open door signifies staff are available for questions, while a closed door asks that you return later. The signs on all offices display the schedule for the DHLab’s open office hours, a regular time during which staff are reliably available for drop-in consultations (researchers who cannot meet during office hours can schedule consultations for other times).</p>
<p>Implementing this design involved creating several openings in a structural wall to transform what was the former bookstack annex into a space for human specialists. DHLab staff worked alongside architects to optimize the offices for DH workflows. For instance, the DHLab’s User Experience Designer and Developer share an inner sliding door they can push back so that they can, on occasion, turn their two offices into one, allowing them to more easily converse during production sprints. The repurposing of the annex created designated, visible spaces for expertise and support that also provided DHLab staff with mechanisms for signaling availability.</p>
<p>The meeting room, a rectangular space that occupies part of the former annex and is therefore also adjacent to the main open lab space, provides DHLab staff and collaborators with a sound-controlled location for presentations, meetings, and smaller classes. Display screens are affixed to each of the shorter walls in the room to facilitate presentations. On one of the longer walls, there is a magnetic, glass whiteboard to help with sketching ideas and designs, while the opposite wall acknowledges Yale’s early interest in humanities computing. A poster of Father Roberto Busa working on a teletype at Yale in 1956 is affixed to one end of the wall, while a poster of the cover page to the proceedings of the  “Computers for the Humanities?”  conference held at Yale in 1965 is at the other end. Between the posters are windows that look out into one of the Library’s hallways. Given the DHLab’s investment in making DH work visible, these windows remain uncovered so that people passing through the Library can have a glimpse into what the DHLab is working on.</p>
<h2 id="campus-connections">Campus Connections</h2>
<p>Although DH labs can serve as effective hubs on campuses for computational work, they are often not the only places where digital work occurs. Studying the larger ecosystem of where such work takes place can help to identify opportunities for cross-unit collaborations, whether that take the form of shared expertise or equipment. At Yale, two centers that predate the DHLab — the Center for Engineering Innovation and Design (CEID) and the Center for Collaborative Arts and Media (CCAM) — have 3D printers available for researchers to use, along with training sessions to help people get started. When it was time to make a decision about what to include in the DHLab, the team decided that the strength of other campus units in 3D printing meant that we could refer clients to those existing service points (and their accompanying expert staff). This freed up space in the Special Projects Cube for other kinds of equipment less readily accessed by humanists on campus.</p>
<p>To bring the expertise of subject librarians and curators — those most familiar with the promise and idiosyncrasies of the Library’s holdings — into DH conversations, the DHLab has designated four touchdown spaces where Library staff can meet with researchers or demonstrate projects of interest. Located in the four corners of the main space, the touchdown desks signal specialized support. For instance, the Geographic Information Specialist (GIS) Librarian, whose office is located in CSSSI, holds weekly office hours in the DHLab. She meets with researchers at the corner desk that is located next to the GIS books in the space so that she may easily refer to texts in the collection that might be helpful resources. Even when she is not physically present in the DHLab, researchers may still find her contact information on the desk. Along with serving as touchdown spaces for library and museum professionals on campus, the corner desks also provide a workstation for visiting scholars who might be on campus to give a talk or workshop in the space.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The transformation of a 1931 Reserve Book Reading Room into the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory involved new ways of thinking about location, materiality, transparency, security, collaboration, and adjacency. The challenge of adaptive reuse of a historic (and historicizing) space is undoubtedly different from the process of renovating a newer, less decorative facility — or constructing a completely new room. The diverse team that came together to accomplish this — student and faculty participants, library and IT professionals, external architects, and university facilities specialists — were well aware of the significance of this room to Sterling Memorial Library’s design and history, as well as the scholarly practice that is emerging around DH on campus. The various interventions in structure, materials, function, and organization of the room to transform it into the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory involved both empirical evidence, discussions with campus stakeholders, and educated guesses about what DH scholarship might evolve towards in an era when interdisciplinarity is increasingly inflected by the algorithm and the dataset. Yale’s deep commitment to the Humanities, and its Library’s scholarly support for the same, has always been expressed in world-class physical holdings and subject specialist expertise. The design of the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory is an effort to reflect that same commitment, and that same support, in a new lab embedded within a historic room.</p>

<p>Revisiting a certain chapter in the history of structuralism from the point of view of contemporary digital research in the humanities sounds in no way provocative or controversial. Claude Lévi-Strauss’s structuralism, with its systemic, large-scale view, has already been referred to in the context of digital humanities, as in Alan Liu’s article discussing the backdrop for the DH-fuelled debates on meaning <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Moreover, there has been some evident interest in structural anthropology’s liaisons with computers (for instance: <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>) and its linkage with cybernetics <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. As I will show in this paper, it is also by dint of its specific institutional and infrastructural making that the structuralist movement continues to prove compelling for today’s research agenda in the digital humanities. With  <em>Laboratoire d’anthropologie sociale</em>  as its main hothouse, Lévi-Straussian anthropology appears to have been an early-adopter of the now increasingly popular idea of the humanities lab.</p>
<p>This paper uses a case study of Claude Lévi-Strauss’s Laboratory of Social Anthropology, or simply the LAS, officially established at the Collège de France in 1960 and still a part of its structure, to gain insights into the significance of infrastructure in the analog humanities laboratory. In order to cast some light on the physical situatedness of the LAS and the pragmatic, entrepreneurial side of its workings, I will discuss how this lab was initially organized around its prominent research apparatus – namely, the Human Relations Area Files, commonly referred to as the  <em>Files</em>  or HRAF – and how this instrument was mobilized by Lévi-Strauss to secure funding and space and fulfill the goals as well as scientific ambitions of structural anthropology.</p>
<p>What exactly were the  <em>Files</em> ? In hindsight, they appear to be a vast pre-electronic ethnographical database. Their creators described this instrument as  “a collection of primary source materials”  as well as a  “major data retrieval system”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. HRAF, produced at Yale, served as a repository of selected ethnographic literature, mainly already-published articles and books written in or translated into English, with the aim being to cover all known cultures (or at least a representative sample of them).</p>
<p>Each paragraph of a text was annotated and indexed by HRAF analysts using two sets of categories. The first (known as  <em>Outline of World Cultures</em> ) was geographical, with each world region, ethnic and cultural group ascribed an individual numeric code. The second ( <em>Outline of Cultural Materials</em> ) involved indexing the materials according to subject matter, which ultimately strives to cover all aspects of human existence (from religion, magic, kinship, law and political systems to technology, cuisine and sexual practices, etc.). In each file on a particular culture, the source texts were reproduced both in full, maintaining the original page order, as well as in processed form, thus bearing significant amounts of metadata (on multiple levels), with the pages relating to a particular subject grouped together. Each page of a document also contained a header featuring standard bibliographical information as well as the codes (or notations) signaling, for example, the level of education attained by the author or an assessment of the quality of the source. Also attached was the  <em>File Guide</em>  that included information on which other sources relating to a particular culture had also been consulted but not included among the  <em>Files</em> . The name of the HRAF analyst who created the particular text was also given. Examples of sample file pages could be found in <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and on the HRAF website.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  A glimpse of these multilayered metadata and indexing methods is still offered to some extent by today’s eHRAF online database – here are examples of the HRAF files of Claude Lévi-Strauss’s ethnographic texts on the Nambicuara and Bororo.</p>

<h2 id="analog-humanities-lab">Analog humanities lab</h2>
<p>My interest in the LAS and its practicalities developed while conducting research within the collaborative project “The humanities laboratory as a mode of knowing. From archaeology to a project”, designed with Jacek Małczyński and Dorota Wolska and reflecting upon the forms a laboratory-type approach to scholarship could take in the humanities.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  Starting from the basic premise that the humanities laboratory is a distinct mode of knowing and that it is not to serve as a mere imitation of the scientific lab (despite its obvious adjacency to that domain), we assume the following determinants in helping to grasp specificity of this modus: (1) experimenting, (2) collaboration, (3) the significance of the research infrastructure, (4) openness (personal, discipline-wise, and institutional), (5) the labile position of the researcher (fluidity of the boundaries between the inside and the outside of the laboratory, and the resulting problem of the humanist’s involvement). In an attempt to revise the image of the laboratory as an institution of strictly natural sciences and to search for deeper discursive layers of this particular knowledge-making setting, we have taken up the  <em>archaeology of the humanities laboratory</em> .<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>For at least a decade the humanities have seen a conspicuous proliferation of new initiatives labelled as laboratories. Little is known, however, about their historical forms. Analysis of them, in a somewhat Foucauldian manner, steers clear of seeking the unequivocal origins of the humanities lab and creating a linear history – instead it foregrounds recursion and the element of chance in the process of constituting the humanistic laboratory. Exploring the LAS as one of the prefigurations of the contemporary humanities labs<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  and focusing on its infrastructural advantage, which will be explicated later on, is intended here as a deliberate media-archaeological move, undermining claims that the observed laboratorization of the field is merely a recent and fleeting trend.</p>
<p>In this archaeological vein, I situate Lévi-Strauss’s lab in the analog humanities. I adopt a notion of the analog humanities, aiming to use it in a more rigorous, theory-laden sense rather than simply in a non-methodical, metaphorical way, sometimes signaled by the quotation marks around the term. What I propose is to instill a kind of reflexivity or a retrospective, pre-posterous logic in it (a notion of pre-posterous, pertaining to history and meaning intentional anachronisms, is borrowed from the Dutch art historian Mieke Bal). As Jonathan Sterne argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the analog humanities refers to a nexus of methodological, technological, and institutional conditions across the humanities that have only come into clear focus in retrospect. They refer to the cultural and material infrastructures on which humanists depended and still depend.<br>
<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sense the term serves as a heuristic,  “ _a rhetorical before, _  to accompany the digital,”  despite being somewhat  “monolithic”   <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. One could say that this idea of the analog humanities perfectly embodies the pre-posterous thinking (where pre- and post- are being playfully reconfigured) since it evolved and actually made sense  <em>after</em>  the digital turn in the humanities had drawn our attention to the technological modes of inquiry and to epistemic implications of the academic infrastructures. However, the term is not intended here merely as a negative; a blurry category denoting everything being pre-digital or not-digital. Elsewhere, in his entry on the analog in the  <em>Digital Keywords</em> , Sterne claims that  “we should return some specificity to  the analog  as a particular technocultural sphere”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> — it is not to denote any natural (pre-technical) state of the world, but rather a certain technology of inscription (or representation). With a background in sound studies and the history of sound recording, Sterne conceives of the analog era as a period dominated by analog technologies reproducing print, sound, video and images, but not erasing any earlier media.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  Being rather chronologically specific (although not in a strict way), the notion of analog humanities thus irresistibly seems a periodization concept (which could be deemed problematic).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  Even if we cannot entirely avoid this logic, I would argue that the analog humanities serve here as a term identifying a particular techno-cultural state of scholarship; that is, the role of the word analog in this expression is primarily to emphasize mediality of knowledge production in the humanities and not so much to carve out a certain era.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  In this way perhaps the analog humanities could still make sense in light of the debates on the post-digital, which, as David M. Berry argues, currently defines our times. Berry and Fagerjord notes that Sterne’s definition of the analog humanities is useful in exploring the links between media and epistemology in the humanities, although  “it might overstate the disjuncture between  analog  and  digital ”   <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, in my paper I follow Sterne – I understand the analog humanities as a concept retrospectively facilitated by the digital humanities, intended to characterize a techno-cultural condition of the earlier scholarship. At the same time, I see the analog humanities not as everything that preceded the digital and post-digital age, but rather as a media ecology of print, index cards, typewriters, sound recordings, transparencies, overhead projectors, copiers and microfiches, etc., used by the scholars, especially in the second half of the twentieth century, to which my case study points to. If we were to find a vivid and detailed illustration of this, a description of the LAS’s first interior, written by Emmanuelle Loyer, a biographer of Lévi-Strauss, comes to mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Desks, closets, metal filing cabinets, slide and microfilm cabinets, a ladder, a coat rack, two secretary desks, ten armchairs, as well as data processing and scientific machines: a stencil duplicator, two photocopy machines (Arcor and Polymicro), a projector for still images, two microfilm readers, an electric calculator, a stereophonic record-player, a camera, three tape recorders, electric typewriters (Olivetti,  “extended carriage”  Everest, Olympia, Royal, etc.), and a celestial globe.<br>
<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  By the  “analog humanities lab”  I understand the laboratory of the analog humanities or, to make it more pleonastic, the humanities laboratory which emerged from the analog humanities (of which the LAS happens to be an instantiation). The humanities laboratory is seen as a mode of knowing, but certainly in the case of the LAS it also materializes as a research institution under the very label of the lab (and with the physical premises). Lévi-Strauss’s laboratory constitutes a good case to be investigated within the framework I adopt in this paper, but naturally it is not the only example of the analog humanities.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>

<p>The framework of this study is the archaeology of the humanities infrastructure, built upon media archaeology<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  and informed by the critical infrastructure studies.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  The work being done in this vibrant subfield of the humanistic theory encourages us to examine infrastructure as unavoidably relational<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  and heterogenous, comprising material equipment and installations as well as their human builders and operators, underlying protocols, ideas, or standards. In other words, it highlights both ‘the hard and soft scaffolding’ of research, as named by Shannon Mattern (2016). Furthermore, infrastructure critics and theorists helpfully remind us to study media  “with an infrastructural disposition, that is, with questions of resources and distribution in mind”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, performing an  “infrastructural inversion – foregrounding the truly backstage elements of work practice”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> and to  “engage with infrastructure on the level of packaging”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. In the case of Lévi-Strauss’s Laboratory, the latter could be understood quite literally – as ways of handling tons of packages filled with paper files and sent regularly from New Haven, Connecticut to Paris since the beginning of the 1960s. It is this concrete piece of infrastructure that mostly preoccupies me in this paper and I dwell on the reasons for it in the sections that follow.</p>
<h2 id="the-hraf-as-humanities-infrastructure">The HRAF as humanities infrastructure</h2>
<p>Before turning directly to the nitty-gritty of the LAS, it ought to be mentioned that there has in fact been very little exploration and discussion of the significance of the laboratory in relation to Lévi-Strauss’s oeuvre.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  What could possibly account for such a surprising marginalization or lack of interest? Together with Małczyński and Wolska I posited that the laboratory idea could either have been forgotten (as a relatively minor element of the structuralist program) or overlooked because of the dominance of anti-laboratory ways of thinking fostered by the interpretive anthropology after the peak of structuralism had passed.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  Perhaps it might also be the case that the laboratory has neither been forgotten nor overlooked, but has instead been passed over in silence in light of the pragmatic reasons behind its founding. These very reasons will be revealed as my infrastructural inversion unfolds, making a case for the  <em>significance</em>  of infrastructure (as one of the hypothetical determinants of the humanities laboratory listed above), understood in a twofold way – as evidenced by the dictionaries, significance could mean both importance, the quality of being worthy of attention and the ability to convey meaning. The latter could be further interpreted within the media studies perspective, asserting that conveying is hardly epistemically neutral and that to convey meaning would be at the same time to shape it. We can rephrase it into a question of how research tools, spatial arrangements and management of resources affect the process of humanistic knowing.</p>
<p>As already stated, infrastructure is of vital importance to my description of the LAS. Not only does it result from a chosen approach (according to which the HRAF prefigures research infrastructure as we know it today – for example a digital repository), but it is also grounded in primary source material – Lévi-Strauss’s own statements show that the  <em>Files</em> , acquired with no little difficulty, were at the heart of the Laboratory’s work. Lévi-Strauss admitted that the HRAF formed the center around which he built the institution and that the role of this research instrument was  “comparable to that of the telescope or electron microscope in the natural sciences”  (cited in: <a href="#ab%C3%A9l%C3%A8s2008">Abélès 2008, 66</a>). What this comparison clearly shows is that while grasping infrastructure in the humanities, one is likely to be challenged by its juxtaposition with science.</p>
<p>Therefore, to stress the situatedness of the apparatuses and avoid modelling humanistic infrastructure on the sciences, Patrik Svensson puts forward the idea of the humanistiscope, which  “is much less laden than the aforementioned devices, although it borrows from a scientific infrastructural logic and the Greek for  to look/examine  (which also points to the commonplace privileging of the visual in the infrastructure turn)”   <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. In his paper, Svensson examines which assumptions and expectations are deeply entrenched in the very concept of infrastructure, relating it to science and engineering. Interestingly, the HRAF – although it is just a paper-based collection of indexed ethnographic reports – falls exactly into this category by being (1) expensive,<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  (2)  “used beyond single research groups,” <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  (3) having  “considerable longevity”  and (4)  “a sense of discreteness and unity,”  being  “described by a name or a phrase”   <sup id="fnref2:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, or, we could add, in this case also by an acronym. The HRAF thus constitutes a perfect instantiation of infrastructure tout court. Likewise, it meets the basic criteria of infrastructure proposed by <a href="#star1999">Susan Leigh Star (1999, 381-382)</a>, such as embeddedness in other structures or layers, transparency (unless it breaks) and taken-for-grantedness, significant reach, modularity, the ability to embody standards and protocols and a nature that is learnt and practiced through community-driven conventions.</p>
<p>It seems particularly relevant to consider a lab of the analog humanities in terms of its infrastructure. The humanities have always had infrastructure even if it was rather unlikely to be recognized as readily as in the case of the contemporary cyberinfrastructure and the digital labs. Commenting on a common (and erroneous) notion that the humanities in general do not actually have (or have had) infrastructure, Svensson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the view of basic humanities as having little or no significant infrastructure not only assumes a science- and technology-based idea of what makes up infrastructure but also imposes a pen-and-paper construction of the humanities. Pen and paper, while inherently communicative and collaborative, is also linked to the assumption that humanities scholarship is to a large extent a solitary endeavor.<br>
<sup id="fnref3:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> The  <em>Files</em>  serve here as a puzzling example eluding straightforward typologies – they fulfill a pen-and-paper model only partially: as paper files comprising photocopies of articles and monographs which had earlier been annotated by hand by the analysts and as a collectively authored tool designed to aid an individual researcher’s work as well as to diversify pedagogy at both pre-university and college level. In addition, despite being made from paper, the HRAF Files have always seemed to be heading into the digital age, being more than suitable for informatization. Today the HRAF exists as online databases (eHRAF World Cultures and eHRAF Archaeology).<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To unpack the HRAF as foundational infrastructure in the LAS I am posing the following questions: how and when did the  <em>Files</em>  find their way to Lévi-Strauss’s Laboratory? How did they operate? What did they bring along – in terms of any in-built theory, methods, scientific rationale as well as reputation, possible connotations and network of allies and foes? How was the HRAF put to use (or repurposed) in the particular setting of the LAS and in Lévi-Strauss’s own work? What was its position then and what status does it enjoy today?</p>
<h2 id="infrastructural-advantage-and-the-persistence-of-paper">Infrastructural advantage and the persistence of paper</h2>
<p>Moving on to describe in greater detail the inner workings of the LAS and its use of the HRAF, one should actually start from the beginning. But when exactly was that? It is difficult to pinpoint when Lévi-Strauss first learnt about the  <em>Files</em> . Having spent several years in the US meeting the most prominent American anthropologists, he availed himself of cutting-edge trends and methods and must have heard of the widely advertised initiative started at Yale University by the anthropologist George Peter Murdock.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  As reported in a volume published for the occasion of the LAS’s fiftieth anniversary <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>, Lévi-Strauss managed to acquire the files as early as 1958, two years before the Laboratory was formally established. He might have benefitted from his role as secretary general of the International Social Science Council, founded under the auspices of UNESCO (of which he happened to say that it was an organization  “without goal or function,”  but in disposition of  “some means”   <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. With UNESCO funding and thanks to the efforts of Gaston Berger from the French Ministry of National Education, Claude Lévi-Strauss’s Laboratory (as a part of the École pratique des hautes études) came into possession of the only complete paper copy of the HRAF card index in Europe. As Lévi-Strauss noted, he succeeded in this mission  “after many tribulations;”  moreover, the funding conditions meant that his center was obliged to make the HRAF available to any interested party <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If we were to apply the categories used in describing competition over natural resources, we could say that it was because of the files that LAS acquired infrastructural advantage, having access to something otherwise unavailable outside North America and Japan. In order to emphasize its ownership of the imported papers or to domesticate them – for HRAF members did not technically own the files, they only enjoyed the privilege of keeping and using them – the Laboratory gave its own name to the collection –  <em>Centre documentaire d&rsquo;ethnologie comparée</em> .<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  The infrastructural advantage of the LAS was of course closely related to prestige and the sense of exclusivity which was in turn – perhaps surprisingly – amplified by a paper technology. It should be said that in 1958 the  <em>Files</em>  were introduced in a microfiche format which proved quite efficient – cheaper to ship, more durable and taking up far less space. Still, the paper versions continued to be produced until 1984. Why did Lévi-Strauss’ Laboratory opt for the paper version, given its constant problems with obtaining adequate space (a more detailed account of these difficulties will follow)? After all, subscribing to the paper HRAF was burdensome, involving endless boxes of 5 x 8 inches loose paper slips which had to be carefully filed and properly stored.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  Loyer notes that in its second year in the LAS the HRAF already consisted of  “about two million index cards, organized in 380 double metal filing cabinets, weighing 7.5 tons and taking up 18 cubic meters of space”   <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations of this seemingly strange preference of the LAS’s administrators (namely, Claude Lévi-Strauss and his deputy and right-hand, Isac Chiva). First is that a robust HRAF collection could have acted as a pretext concocted by Lévi-Strauss in his efforts to receive a more comfortable location. What is more, one of the researchers currently working in the LAS drew my attention to the fact that due to the singular rules of succession at the Collége de France, it is more likely for the chair to justify its continued existence when it possesses some expensive specialist equipment (which usually pertained to the natural sciences chairs, but also to the extraordinary resources used by humanists, like for instance particularly rich and valuable libraries or collections of artifacts).<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, the persistence of paper  <em>Files</em>  in the LAS could have more to do with joining an international prestigious club than with locally situated institutional equilibristics. <a href="#lemov2015">Rebecca Lemov (2015, 137)</a> notes that the Laboratory was among the handful of first-tier subscribers (i.e. sponsor members), alongside for example Harvard, who received full-sized paper copies. Everyone else (the so called microfiles members) received miniaturized photographic reproductions.</p>
<p>However, there is yet another explanation that should be considered: the limited number of twenty five paper sets of the HRAF ever produced (one set located in the headquarters at Yale and twenty-four copies entrusted to the sponsor members) was part of the arrangements made by the HRAF corporation with the publishers holding the copyrights to the ethnographic sources reprinted in the  <em>Files</em>  — they agreed on releasing twenty five copies in total (see: <a href="#roe2007">Roe 2007, 64</a>). Expanding the number of subscribers was thus only feasible by changing the medium of publication – apparently microfiches were acceptable as derivative version of paper originals, which were ultimately xeroxed copies. As evidenced by a 1970 report by the HRAF president <a href="#ford1970">Clellan Ford (1970,39)</a>, in that period there were already eight microfiche collection of the  <em>Files</em>  in Europe (for instance in Germany, Holland, Sweden and Switzerland). The Laboratory of Social Anthropology in Paris was thus in charge of a truly unique resource but only for several years after its purchase or as long as we conceive this exclusivity as bound to a concrete technology of reproduction.</p>
<p>Roe remarks that paper versions of HRAF indeed held some prestige – in fact, they were highly valued, kept in specially arranged and locked places and not available to students or members of the public without some precautions (such as prior training) <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. However, what can be inferred from the updated lists of subscribers published throughout the years in occasional reports is that not every sponsor member that acquired a paper-based collection decided to keep it – hence the paper  <em>Files</em>  travelled to new campuses. Perhaps the membership was too costly to maintain for many years or it just seemed more practical and modern to switch to microfiches. Alternatively, apart from all the practical issues, being a part of an exclusive paper-aficionados club did not in the end turn out to be sufficiently prestigious.</p>
<h2 id="resources-and-relocations-highlighting-care-work">Resources and relocations: highlighting care work</h2>
<p>Fresh batches of files reached the Laboratory each year thanks to its subscription. Cataloging and storing the materials demanded ever more effort and space. Lévi-Strauss explained that this was the reason behind the Laboratory’s multiple changes of location. The Laboratory’s location for the first five years of its existence was in an annex to the Musée Guimet on Avenue d’Iéna (formerly the private residence of Emile Guimet, it was not necessarily fit to house a research organization). It comprised two rooms, with the largest being almost completely filled by the files, while a smaller one (a reconfigured bathroom with the stumps of pipes protruding from the floor) was shared by several researchers: Lévi-Strauss, Isac Chiva, his collaborator Françoise Flis (Zonabend) and Jean Pouillon, the editor of  <em>L’Homme</em> .<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  This did not stop Susan Sontag from claiming in her review article  “A Hero of our Time”   <a href="#sontag1963">(1963)</a> that Lévi-Strauss  “heads a large and richly endowed research institute” , much to the bewilderment of Chiva. The reputation enjoyed by the Laboratory and its founder certainly encouraged one to imagine its physical location as something much grander than it was in reality.</p>
<p>Its second home, this time located in the Latin Quarter (Place Marcelin-Berthelot) and installed in the Collége buildings (which, as revealed in the interview with Didier Eribon, appeared crucial to <a href="#l%C3%A9vistrauss1991">Lévi-Strauss (1991, 75)</a>), was more grandiose but even it became too cramped over time. The burgeoning HRAF files were too heavy for the eighteenth-century building’s ceilings to bear. There was also a growing team of over thirty technical and research staff. Space was in short supply. The sound of talking and the noise generated by typewriters made working conditions in the common room difficult, if not impossible. Rooms were thus divided to create individual compartments. There seems to be a case here of the HRAF exerting proxemic dominance. The ability to store the  <em>Files</em>  even took precedence over guaranteeing individual and spacious offices for researchers. The Latourian non-human actor dominated the Laboratory’s space. Accommodating the HRAF collection was an issue that made Lévi-Strauss and Chiva boldly apply for greater floorspace, customarily rather unthinkable for the human sciences facilities. Loyer points out that Lévi-Strauss requested 2,000 square meters, while the standard was 150-200, envisioning a perfect location as having  “an adjoining reading room, two offices for archivists, a photographic workshop, fifteen offices for researchers and a reading and conference room”   <sup id="fnref2:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. The Laboratory moved to its third and current location in 1985, doubling its space.</p>
<p>Presenting his Laboratory in the journal  <em>Reveu de L’enseignement supérieur</em> , Lévi-Strauss indicates four main areas it should develop in, namely: teaching, documentation, research and publication <a href="#l%C3%A9vistrauss1965a">(1965)</a>. He spoke at length about how the training in anthropology should be organized in his text  “The Place of Anthropology in the Social Sciences and Problems Raised in Teaching It”  (see: <a href="#l%C3%A9vistrauss1968">Lévi-Strauss 1968</a>). On several occasions Lévi-Strauss voiced his views on how neglected were problems of tools and resources in the human sciences, beginning his response to a UNESCO survey in 1964 with these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how much more efficient it would have been if, at the national level, there were the granting of a place of work to scattered researchers, who are most often demoralized by the lack of a chair, a table, and the few square yards indispensable for the decent exercise of their work; by the nonexistence or insufficiency of libraries, and the lack of funds<br>
<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier on, in  <em>The Structural Study of Myth</em> , where he imagines analyzing myths by disassembling them into smaller units written down on index cards, pigeon-holed and reconfigured with the help of enormous wooden boards (two meters long and one and one-half meters high), later to be replaced by perforated cards and IBM equipment, Lévi-Strauss complains about the limited means for such research in France. What he has in mind speaking of such means is  “a spacious workshop” ,  “special devices”  and a team comprising both researchers and technicians. He adds:  “it is much desired that some American group, better equipped than we are here in Paris, will be induced by this paper to start a project of its own in structural mythology”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  As evidenced by this quote, Lévi-Strauss envisaged his research as inherently collective. However, one can argue that this idea of collaboration is principally of a pragmatic (or instrumental) nature; Lévi-Strauss was aware that such a study would only be feasible (in a reasonable time) when taken up by a group.</p>
<p>Lévi-Strauss actively sought to secure funds and spaces, since, as he noted, they were inadequate at the outset. He was able to seize the chance of establishing a prospering human sciences lab, recognizing in the 1960s that, thanks to the French state&rsquo;s Fifth Plan, new funding opportunities for collective research had arrived.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  Moreover, cognizant of the perks of the status of laboratory chair (which entitled the holder to greater office space), Lévi-Strauss had the faculty assembly vote to grant them such a status, although at that time only 14 out of 52 chairs in the Collége had a laboratory (see: <a href="#loyer2018">Loyer 2018, 391</a>). He was skilled in garnering attention, using the experience gained in the US and contacts with the charities like Rockefeller or Ford Foundation and the Wenner-Gren Foundation.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  Loyer describes the LAS not as  “a theoretical engine room”  of structuralism, but rather a place where scholars  “would receive resources they needed to pursue their work”   <sup id="fnref3:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> – inter alia, the HRAF files. <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  For instance, Philippe Descola (later the director of the LAS) remembers that as a young researcher not yet fully engaged in the Laboratory, he benefitted from it, occasionally making photocopies (however trivial and mundane this privilege might seem for us today) <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In light of the above brief reconstruction of the Lévi-Straussian knack for academic entrepreneurship, we could say that the  “infrastructural disposition” , advised by Lisa Parks, foregrounding questions of resources and distribution, is actually something that characterizes Lévi-Strauss. Apart from his great intellectual renown, he epitomizes the canny organizer and facilitator.</p>
<p>To use a notion proposed by Antonijević, Dormans and Wyatt in their study on collaboration in virtual knowledge <a href="#antonijevi%C4%872013">(2013)</a>, looking after coworkers, space, resources and budget allocations could be seen as expressions of care work – a sort of immaterial, affective labor in academia. Many of this informal aspects of being caring as well as careful   <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> tend to remain invisible in research outputs, difficult to discern against a backdrop of administrative documents and traditional academic genres. In posthumous overviews and summaries of the scientific legacy one is more likely to find a list of an academic’s achievements, projects, awards and publications than an appreciation like this one stating that  “Lévi-Strauss was to devote a significant part of his life to channeling young (and not so young) energies and to organizing collective work”   <sup id="fnref4:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, a discussion of care work in the LAS is not to depict it as an idealized, team-spirited site of academic work; free of conflicts and forming the proclaimed direct democracy (while Lévi-Strauss explicitly spoke of this prevailing modus operandi, supposedly  “down to and including the cleaning woman”   <sup id="fnref2:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>, his biographer suggests it was rather an  “enlightened monarchy”   <sup id="fnref5:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  Nor should it be suggested that Lévi-Strauss was a lone hero (to echo Sontag’s essay title) – in fact, a great deal of care work in the LAS must have been done cooperatively, engaging other academics and staff. This also involved taking care of the HRAF – someone had to unpack, arrange, catalog and maintain the files pouring into the LAS’ library in order to make them available. Throughout the years there have been several people managing the library (Marion Abélès, among others) and additional specialists in charge of the HRAF (Nicole Belmont, Tina Jolas, Roberto Miguelez, Solange Pinton – to name just a few) <sup id="fnref2:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Being used to doing administrative work alongside his scientific activities, Lévi-Strauss stated that  “directing the laboratory was a load”  he  “carried most willingly” , though not without  “some secretarial help”   <sup id="fnref3:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  Also, he relied heavily on the LAS’ assistant director and his long-time closest collaborator, Isac Chiva. In a private letter to Chiva dated back to 1976, he admitted:  “I have not said that the laboratory helped me directly in my own work, but that I could never have managed to do it if you had not so greatly relieved me of the task of managing that institution,”  repeating this praise much later (in 2003) in another letter:  “For I would never have embarked on the adventure of the laboratory if I had not known that you were ready to come along with me”  (cited in: <a href="#loyer2018">Loyer 2018, 387-388</a>). What might be true of any academic center, the LAS could not have flourished if it had not been for a significant load of immaterial work performed by its permanent, apprentice and visiting researchers, by technicians, journal editors, research coordinators, archivists, librarians, and the secretarial personnel. Strauss could have been a central figure crucial for functioning of the lab (often attributed to him as his laboratory), but he also thrived on the endeavors undertaken by others. Even if, as his biographer points out, Lévi-Strauss never stopped working on his own, nourishing his soloist nature and spending half a day in the Laboratory and the rest in his office, it could be claimed that the LAS, the plan for which Lévi-Strauss had had in his mind for a long time,<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  constituted for him a vital knowledge environment, additionally luring many academics from around the world.</p>
<h2 id="background-of-the-hraf">Background of the HRAF</h2>
<p>Let us now turn again to the Human Relations Area Files in order to investigate the conceptual and practical baggage that the HRAF might have carried along – its theoretical and methodological pedigree, inherent assumptions, and any links – institutional or personal – clinging to this instrument.</p>
<p>The  <em>Files</em>  are in a way a co-authored publication – a product of the teamwork of the HRAF analysts<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  and the authors of the ethnographic texts. It is not only the research team associated with Yale who were behind their production and distribution, but also a consortium officially founded in 1949 that initially involved other US universities: Harvard and the Universities of Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Washington.</p>
<p>Tracing the history of HRAF, the anthropologist George Peter Murdock emerges as the driving force behind the whole enterprise. As Rebecca Lemov has noted in her book  <em>World as Laboratory</em>   <a href="#lemov2006">(2006)</a>, Murdock was a Yale professor famous for his encyclopedic knowledge. In 1928, he started constructing a bibliography on the subject of various cultures around the world. After several years working alone, his project transformed into the collective endeavor that became the  <em>Cross-Cultural Survey</em> . From 1935, Murdock’s team operated under the aegis of the Yale Institute of Human Relations, which saw it as suitable for their experimental and comparative social science research. It is particularly notable — and has already been discussed at length (see: <a href="#price2012">Price 2012</a>, <a href="#price2016">2016</a>) — that the  <em>Files</em>  experienced their most intensive period of development during the Second World War. It was then that the project acquired the financial support of the military and US intelligence. It was a valuable operational instrument during the War and also later in Cold War imperialist policy, offering a rich source of systematic data that could easily be misused as intelligence information. Lévi-Strauss was almost certainly aware (at least to some extent) of the rather inglorious backstage of the HRAF development. He noted in interviews that it was created  “on behalf of the United States government”   <sup id="fnref4:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</p>
<p>According to the handbook  <em>Nature and Use of the HRAF Files</em>   <sup id="fnref2:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, the files were initially intended as a tool for testing hypotheses (constructed on the basis of causal relations between variables) and hence would lead to the generation of a  “valid theory in the social and behavioral sciences.”  Exemplary questions posed by cross-cultural researchers could be: Is there an association between most important subsistence activity and level of political complexity? or Why do some societies practice matrilocal residence and others patrilocal residence?  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. Lagacé claims a certain a-theoretical nature of this apparatus, stating that the  <em>Files</em>    “constitute an organized collection of data, and they should be used to retrieve data, not theory”   <sup id="fnref3:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Looking for theoretical underpinnings of the HRAF, Rebecca Lemov inquired into Murdock’s education and any intellectual influences he might have been affected by – rejected by Franz Boas, he did his Ph.D. at Yale, studying under A. G. Keller in the tradition of W. G. Sumner (both associated with the evolutionism to which Boas was rather hostile). However, Lemov concludes that  “the files were now neither Kellerian nor Boasian, but, increasingly, Murdockian”   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. This, on the one hand, could mean that he started to realize his own vision of anthropology as a part of the empirical behavioral sciences and connect the  <em>Files</em>  with a discourse of laboratory trials, calling the HRAF  “a sort of social science laboratory”   <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. On the other hand, he tended to present the HRAF as a merely auxiliary tool, reducing the time and effort needed to complete research by taking out  “the leg work” ,  “all the routine unproductive labor”  and freeing the researcher’s creativity <sup id="fnref1:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The HRAF-ers were well aware of the critical responses to that idea – Ford noted that it was seen as unnecessary pampering of scholars by, for instance, Alfred Kroeber <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. This could seem not only needless, but, more importantly, undesirable for epistemic reasons. In their review of the HRAF, Clarke and Henige discuss reducing the chores like bibliographical survey and translation of sources:  “we can ask, if only rhetorically here, whether the serious scholar should allow him or herself this particular luxury. That is, both the HRAF and electronic databases may well take too many decisions (as well as some work) away from the individual scholar, and it is indeed debatable whether this is, on balance, desirable”   <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="the--_files_--and-the-las-refitting">The  <em>Files</em>  and the LAS: refitting</h2>
<p>In this section I examine on what levels the  <em>Files</em>  were compatible with the LAS’s research and what was its connection to Lévi-Strauss’s work. Did the HRAF afford structuralist studies? How was it put to use in Paris? Bruno Latour offered a fairly radical take on it, stating that  “Lévi-Strauss’s theories of savages are an artifact of card indexing at the Collége de France”   <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. Putting aside Latour’s rhetorical emphasis, is the connection indeed so undeniable?</p>
<p>Like Murdock and his team at Yale, Lévi-Strauss appreciated the speed with which information could be searched for in the HRAF catalog. Based on his own empirical testing, i.e. using his own experience, Murdock claimed that using the files meant a text could be written in a little more than 24 hours rather than the 24 days that a standard search through a library would entail <sup id="fnref2:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. Perhaps this is what Margaret Mead also had in mind when she criticized the Human Relations Area Files for being  “instant anthropology, like instant coffee.” <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  It was both the unusual speed and reliance on second-hand, republished sources (which the HRAF-ers called simply data, as though it were stripped of context) that is targeted here. There is no hiding the fact that using the HRAF might provoke associations with an already at that time outdated armchair anthropology. Interestingly, a tool which was said to elevate a regular library to the next level in terms of its scope and ease could have interested Lévi-Strauss, who described himself as a library man, not necessarily too keen on prolonged fieldwork (see: <a href="#l%C3%A9vistrauss1991">Lévi-Strauss and Eribon 1991, 44</a>).</p>
<p>The  <em>Files</em> , conceived as a kind of laboratory by Murdock and called the laboratory without walls by librarians, as Clarke and Henige acknowledge <sup id="fnref1:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>, embodied a narrative and aura of experimentation, tailored for the needs of the Laboratory of Social Anthropology. After all, the laboratory label was chosen by the LAS founder on purpose, and he was aware of the obvious connotations it carried.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  His views on the relations between the natural, social and human sciences and the position of the latter are in fact quite compelling and by all means would deserve a more detailed investigation. Risking an oversimplification, one could say that Lévi-Strauss’s mindset was close to a nuanced form of scientism. While speaking about choosing a name for his center, he resorts to etymology, as if he tried to revisit the history of the lab as a strictly science domain, as well as nodding to the hard sciences, which he understands as more advanced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people were surprised that the term laboratory could be applied to a center for the human sciences. In adopting it, however, we did not follow a fashion nor were misled by appearances. According to the etymology, a laboratory is first of all a place where one works. And it suffices to enter ours to see that the methods of ethnological research today adopt a style that brings them closer to those of more advanced sectors.<br>
(cited in: <a href="#belmont2008">Belmont 2008, 62</a>) Elsewhere, he said:  “We consider ourselves, rather, as artisans, laboriously bending over phenomena which are too small to excite human passions, but whose value comes from the fact they can, when grasped at this level, become the object of a rigorous knowledge”  (cited in: <a href="#pace1983">Pace 1983, 5</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to look into this metaphorical language of the lab (microscopes and lab benches that researchers bend over are only hinted at in the scene imagined in the latter quote) that Strauss drew on, constructing a conceptual image of his center.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  Besides, the LAS – the first social science lab in the Collége – was not an only initiative so denominated. There was also the Laboratory of Graphics at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (founded by Jacques Bertin, who created diagrams for  <em>The Raw and the Cooked</em> ).<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup></p>
<p>Like a telescope or microscope, the HRAF perfectly fit Lévi-Strauss’s famous formula of conducting anthropology from afar. According to Lévi-Strauss,  “the anthropologist is the astronomer of the social sciences: his task is to discover a meaning for configurations which, owing to their size and remoteness, are very different from those within the observer’s immediate purview”   <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. Indeed, locating hundreds of files on a single table or a collection of two million pages on the subject of three hundred cultures from around the world in metal drawers in one room offered a perfect example of zooming out in producing knowledge.</p>
<p>Melvin Ember, who served as the HRAF president in 1987, promoted the  _ Files_  by quoting a passage on laboratorial anthropology treating societies as ready-made experiments. The author of these words was none other than Claude Lévi-Strauss <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. In a text presenting the LAS, Lévi-Strauss used exactly the same terminology as the creators of HRAF: variables, positive and negative correlations, and the verification of hypotheses <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>. However, elsewhere he mostly referred to it as  “an enormous documentary tool”  or  “a bibliographical treasure”  and he stressed:  “the card index to the  <em>Files</em> , which some people have unwisely denigrated, is above all a library”   <sup id="fnref5:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. This actually proves that Lévi-Strauss treated this tool in a fairly traditional way.</p>
<p>What puzzles me is the fact that despite all the praise, Lévi-Strauss hardly spoke of the  <em>Files</em>  as useful in his writing. Even while describing his work on the well-documented and abundant volumes of  <em>Mythologies</em> , when he had to comb through all relevant ethnographic literature to distill myths, he never made use of the HRAF collection explicit.<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>  It is possible, of course, that he had used it like a standard library and decided to cite only primary sources he retrieved, without acknowledging the tool itself (which seems also to be the case in the usage of today’s online repositories).</p>
<p>Was HRAF widely used in the Parisian Laboratory? I was not able to determine it, but, according to Lévi-Strauss himself, some key figures like Raymond Aron, Gabriel Le Bras, Jacques Lacan and Pierre Bourdieu expressed interest in it (cited in: <a href="#loyer2018">Loyer 2018, 385</a>). Also, Simone de Beauvoir was said to consult the HRAF (see: <a href="#salerno2004">Salerno 2004, 137</a>). Regarding collaboration fostered by the HRAF, it appears that sharing infrastructure did not necessarily lead to working together.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  The collection was rather used individually by scholars. Referring to an already mentioned account of the spatial constraints imposed on the LAS’s members by the growing HRAF, we can observe that expansion of the  <em>Files</em>  led to shrinkage of office space and eventually resulted in adding partition walls,  “especially under the Mansard roof, to create individual cubicles”   <sup id="fnref6:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. The sheer size of the HRAF was perhaps more likely to affect work habits and forms of sociality in the Laboratory (solidifying a perceived need for a solo studio, or a cubicle) rather than transform modes of doing research. Regarding affordances of the  <em>Files</em>  coming from their content and organization, they could have lent themselves to analyses undertaken by the LAS’s researchers. Lévi-Strauss talks about collaborating with his colleagues (Lucien Sebag and Jean-Claude Gardin) on the mythology of Pueblos – preparing an inventory,  “laying a myth on the table and analyzing it together”   <sup id="fnref7:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> – maybe the  <em>Files</em>  could have been used for such purposes.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, being a database-like tool, consisting of chunks of ethnographic texts as discrete units mapping different cultures and enabling manipulation and reconfiguration by the scholar, the HRAF could afford and at the same time epitomize  “structuralist activity”  defined by Roland Barthes as the  “fabrication”  of the world, which  “involves two typical operations: dissection and articulation”   <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. Barthes explains:  “Structural man takes the real, decomposes it, then recomposes it; this appears to be little enough (which makes some say that the structuralist enterprise is  meaningless,    uninteresting,    useless,  etc.)”   <sup id="fnref1:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. Interestingly, the very accusations were also made with regard to the  <em>Files</em>  (reportedly, Margaret Mead spoke of their  “artlessness”  – see <a href="#tobin1990">Tobin 1990, 477</a>).</p>
<p>It should be noted here that the critique of the Human Relations Area Files – not uncommon then<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>  – was expressed inside the LAS, too. Furthermore, it came from the chief expert on informatization, appreciated by Lévi-Strauss, Jean-Claude Gardin (who ran  <em>Section d’Automatique documentaire</em>  in CNRS). Gardin is recognized as a pioneer of archaeological computing. As early as in 1960 he published an article reviewing the HRAF in which he points out two main problems of this tool – on a practical level it is too expensive and cumbersome and on a theoretical level it imposes a rigid classification scheme and its categories are too broad to operationalize and lack cross-referencing (see: <a href="#gardin1960">Gardin 1960</a>). He also suggests that the HRAF could be opposed because of its aspirations to universality, or the totalitarianism of a general system. After a few critical remarks on the HRAF, Gardin elaborates on a different project in the making, undertaken in order to search through vast ethnographic literature by employing mechanical methods. The ethnographer in charge of this task had been Françoise Izard (later known as Héritier), who became Lévi-Strauss’s successor.</p>
<p>Yet another interesting critique that should be addressed here pertains to Murdock and his methods and dates back to 1952. The critic is Lévi-Strauss himself. While acknowledging Murdock’s contribution to the study of social structure by rejuvenating statistical methods and painstaking effort in creating Cross-Cultural Survey (a.k.a. HRAF), he points out that the number of 250 cultures selected by Murdock as a sample for cross-cultural analyses is an overindulgent estimate, data is abstracted and the categories used in the scheme mirrored the traditional evolutionary anthropological theory rather than do justice to terms derived from the source material. It is also to be noted – Lévi-Strauss continues – that the method proves efficient mostly in a negative way (when used to scrutinize whether any alleged correlations are plausible). Finally, he states:  “the reader here may easily verify that I take the greatest care to dissociate my conceptions from those of Radcliffe-Brown and Murdock” , adding that he never used statistical methods <sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. This is all rather serious methodological and theoretical critique, suggesting unambiguously that Lévi-Strauss was not willing to use the HRAF in the ways intended by Murdock. Perhaps that is why he reduced it to a rich bibliographical treasury, intending to repurpose it for his newly opened center as a well-equipped library of literature (in English, so probably less widely available in France). After all, having conducted research in the New York Public Library, he knew how useful it was since he touted this place as the bedrock of his expanded anthropological erudition.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to examine what has become these days of the paper HRAF in the LAS. The paper version of HRAF today serves as something of a curiosity. It takes up a lot of space, although nobody uses it for research purposes, but a lot of people do like to take photos in front of it. It is reminiscent of the categories coined by Anke te Heesen writing about a type of furniture – the cabinet or cupboard – and its role in making academic knowledge. The author distinguished several subcategories, one of them being Ordungsmöbel, enabling storing and sorting and the other one Representationmöbel, which is for example a decorative old cabinet, usually emptied and put in the rector’s office as a nostalgic representative of the great many years of tradition <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. Although HRAF drawers are not empty and materials still can be consulted (by appointment), the paper files do not really serve as a go-to library resource, but rather an index of the fascinating origins and adventures of the Laboratory. It is worth asking whether structural anthropology might have shared the fate of the HRAF: has it become to some degree a museum piece?</p>
<p>Traversing through the reception of structuralism and the legacy of the Laboratory in today’s anthropology is beyond the scope of this paper. Notwithstanding, I would like to mention Paul Rabinow’s critique of the LAS. As he has noted, despite its significant achievements in fostering a collective mode of research, LAS has not stood the test of time, failing to adapt its methods to changing realities and solidifying a hierarchical structure perpetuated by Lévi-Strauss’ personal charisma <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>. Rabinow, Collier and Lakoff are also critical of the  <em>Files</em>  and their claims to universality <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>. What is worth noting, though, is that Rabinow and his colleagues have advocated for anthropological laboratories and have founded one themselves. In their blueprint for the lab, infrastructure is recognized as meaningful, no mimicry of the natural science is intended and the most important role is occupied by rigorous concept work (based on collective agreement).<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>This study is a contribution to the archaeology of the humanities laboratory approached from an infrastructure and media angle. My goal was to shed more light on the significance of infrastructure in the analog humanities’ lab by focusing on the case of the  <em>Laboratoire d’anthropologie sociale</em>  founded in 1960 and directed (till 1982) by Claude Lévi-Strauss. Drawing on the literature from the field of humanities infrastructure and research infrastructure as well as other seminal works in critical infrastructure studies, I have shown how the Laboratory was organized around the Human Relations Area Files. They played an important role in seeking funds and space and – considered as valuable and rare resources – were used to gain infrastructural advantage (based on their paper-ness) and helped to position the LAS as richly endowed. I suggest that it may be partly due to these pragmatic reasons – recognized as not epistemically related or valid – that the Laboratory has not had any important place in the readings of Lévi-Strauss’s work.</p>
<p>Moreover, the LAS has not been (yet) rediscovered by the movement towards the humanities labs which we are observing in the present day. We could be tempted to see Lévi-Strauss as a proto-digital humanist (or the humanities’ computing fellow), given his interest in applying computers and new means of documentation to anthropological research. In fact, he rather adhered to more old-fashioned, makeshift methods (as admitted in: <a href="#l%C3%A9vistrauss1991">Lévi-Strauss and Eribon 1991, 138</a>). Meanwhile, he observed – not without great interest – how others in his Laboratory were figuring out how to benefit from computing in the anthropology of kinship.<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup></p>
<p>What this paper also highlights, is a significant load of immaterial academic care work, which means here taking care of (re)sources and (re)locations. Lévi-Strauss appears to be a skillful administrator, fundraiser, facilitator of teaching and publishing platforms and a vocal advocate for the human sciences (despite the scientism he may have subscribed to). He was able to coordinate the LAS’s activities with French state-driven research programs, taking advantage of new higher education policies in the 1960s and 1970s. Caring for the LAS’ material conditions (i. e., maintaining its costly and burdensome HRAF collection) was, though, a team effort. Refocusing my history of this lab on the hidden figures (who contributed greatly to the actual quotidian work of the research institution, failing to be fully acknowledged) seems worthy of exploration and would entail seeking additional source materials.</p>
<p>Lastly, I also examined the place of the  <em>Files</em>  in the Laboratory of Social Anthropology in terms of their mutual or contradictory research goals and methods and theoretical underpinnings. Considering how the HRAF contributed to the situatedness of the lab, I elucidated its imported character and possible implications thereof. I argued that although maintaining this enormous collection influenced the organization of the physical premises of the LAS, it apparently did not alter in a significant way the modes of study (neither did it start intensive research collaborations within the lab, which is sometimes believed to result from sharing infrastructure). It could be said that the HRAF used by Strauss and his Laboratory took on various functions, ranging from boosting the sense of excellence and exclusivity, through being a rhetorical tool in discourse on modernization of the human sciences and experimental anthropology, to even being a bargaining chip in negotiation for a bigger locale. In several respects the  <em>Files</em>  were compatible with research agenda in the Laboratory of Social Anthropology and with its founder’s own proclivities, constituting a repository of  “ready-made experiments”  and lending themselves to structuralist dissection and articulation. However, it is more likely that  <em>Files</em>  in the LAS were actually tailored for its specific (infrastructural) needs and used more traditionally than was intended by their creators – not as a machine for drawing statistical correlations, but rather an efficient library catalog. Through the infrastructural inversion it all comes into focus, proving how seemingly prosaic arrangements tend to be epistemically laden.</p>
<p>Continuing this study will need to pick up some loose threads and engage with the materiality of knowledge production in the LAS. Further research could usefully explore topics such as Lévi-Strauss’s strong inclination to experiments performed with the help of models and mobiles (made from paper and wires and hanging from the ceiling in the Laboratory) and all the handiwork invested in modelling, which he conceived – contrary to common belief – as the work of an engineer rather than a bricoleur.</p>

<p>The Laboratory of Social Anthropology is one of the case studies we chose to investigate in the project (alongside, for instance, Aby Warburg’s Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek, Paul Otlet’s Mundaneum and Jerzy Grotowski’s Laboratory Theatre). Furthermore, we inquire into alchemy cabinets and the cabinets of curiosities as possible pre-figurations of the humanities lab. We presented preliminary findings of this study in a joint paper  “From the Archaeology of the Humanities Lab: A Tricky Case of Claude Lévi-Strauss’s  <em>Laboratoire d’anthropologie sociale</em> ”  at the conference  <em>Making of the Humanities VII</em>  (15-18 November 2018, University of Amsterdam).

<p>A growing interest in the humanities labs (their early forms as well as their infrastructural side) has been shared by several scholars – e.g. Lori Emerson, Jussi Parikka and Darren Wershler in their forthcoming publication  <em>The Lab Book: Situated Practices in Media Studies</em>  (the project website: <a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/the-lab-book">https://manifold.umn.edu/projects/the-lab-book</a>) and Steven E. Jones in his recent work on reconstructing Roberto Busa’s lab (see: <a href="#jones2018">Jones 2018</a> and the collaborative project website: <a href="http://www.recaal.org/">http://www.recaal.org/</a>). The arguments historicizing the current lab fever, which are similar to our assumptions, have also been made by Grant Wythoff <a href="#wythoff2018">(2018)</a>. Other recent works pertaining to the history of the laboratory in the humanities concentrate on the nineteenth century German philological seminars (see: <a href="#spoerhase2019">Spoerhase 2019</a>) and the interwar laboratory operating at the intersection of applied linguistics and acoustics (see: <a href="#tkaczyk2019">Tkaczyk 2019</a>). While the focus of many existing works covering this subject is mostly technical and/or design laboratories of various kinds (media labs, digital humanities labs, fablabs, hacklabs, etc.), our project looks into the cases which would not fall into these categories or may not have been otherwise entangled with media studies or other kindred fields. Thus, the proposed framework of the project, aiming to address the question of the laboratory in the humanistic scholarship conceived more broadly, is complementary to the already mentioned studies. Such a general (and perhaps inescapably vague) conceptualization of the humanities would mean that we have a predilection for an interpretive, qualitative approach, straddling various theoretical and methodological orientations, and we tend to emphasize the humanities’ specificity in regard to the natural and social sciences. However, when looking for the historical instances of the lab we are interested in different disciplines, methods and styles of inquiry – vide this paper discussing the laboratory of structural anthropology which – due to its analytical, anti-historical orientation – could be sometimes contrasted with what is traditionally recognized as humanistic knowledge, especially when one takes into consideration the used nomenclature and national conventions – e.g. distinguishing between the human sciences and the humanities.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>It could be rightfully argued that searching for precursors does not fit a style of analyses inspired by Michel Foucault’s archaeology of knowledge with its disregard for genesis, continuity and totalization. Therefore, we should be cautious when conceptualizing the status of the LAS and choosing terminology. As stated in the dictionaries, precursor and forerunner are by and large used as synonyms, although precursor connotes not only something happening or existing before another thing, but also a person or thing paving the way for the other’s future accomplishments. Together with Małczyński and Wolska I opted for prefiguration, assuming that – being less common and slightly less burdened with teleological thinking – it would be a safer choice.&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The author is not explicit about any dates. We could gather that this period spans across the second half of the nineteenth century and the twentieth century. It would be better, though, not to determine when it definitely ends, as if it gave up to the digital era. Sterne is careful not to draw a line here, stressing that the digital devices operate on the layers of the analog technologies or have analog components. Although we are inclined to contrast the analog with the digital, we could also shift the focus to their points of contact. To further complicate the matter, one shall bear in mind a semantic vagueness of these terms. As evidence by numerous lexicon entries and articles, there are various ways of defining the analog and the digital – some definitions foreground technical conditions (continuity vs discontinuity of the signal), while the others focus more on their cultural and affective attributes (analog being closer to nature and human senses, triggering nostalgia, etc.) or even on a deeper philosophical sense (see: <a href="#buckley2014">Buckley 2014</a>, <a href="#cramer2015">Cramer 2015</a>, <a href="#galloway2014">Galloway 2014</a>, <a href="#schrey2014">Schrey 2014</a>, <a href="#robinson2008">Robinson 2008</a>).&#160;<a href="#fnref:11" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>My grappling with the idea of the analog humanities seen as a periodization tool is in line with the critique of using media as temporal markers presented by Cox <a href="#cox2015">(2015)</a> and Gitelman <a href="#gitelman2010">(2010)</a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:12" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>My discussion of the analog humanities lab presented above is in fact framed in a media archaeological perspective, in which insights of past and often obsolete technologies inform our understanding of the contemporary media age and vice versa. Media archaeology foregrounds the materiality of scholarly work, revisiting old and purportedly discarded technologies of intellectual labour (such as the HRAF in both paper and microfiches form) and avoids viewing technological change in terms of imminent progress. The proposed archaeology of the humanities infrastructure also alludes to a Foucauldian sense of archaeology, repurposed by media scholars (e.g. F. Kittler), and seen here as an analysis of the (techno-cultural) conditions of knowledge. Media archaeology does not form a unified field or discipline, being perhaps rather a style or aesthetics of the historical reflection on media and cultural techniques (for a synthesizing account see: <a href="#parikka2012">Parikka 2012</a>). The most stimulating for my thinking have been works and ideas by Lori Emerson, Errki Huhtamo, Markus Krajewski, Jussi Parikka, and Siegfried Zielinski.&#160;<a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The body of research within the purview of critical infrastructure studies have been growing, as evidenced by an extensive bibliography curated by Alan Liu, which can be found online: <a href="https://cistudies.org/critical-infrastructures-bibliography/">https://cistudies.org/critical-infrastructures-bibliography/</a>. Critical infrastructure studies encompass many different approaches to infrastructure (informed by the science and technology studies, ethnography, media studies, digital humanities, art and design, etc.). They also seem to include a narrower field of studies dealing with research infrastructure or – even more precisely, humanities infrastructure, seen as a more domain-specific type of infrastructure, devoted specifically to enable research and used within the scholarly communities. Different, yet overlapping, terms exist in the literature – namely: research infrastructure (see: <a href="#anderson2013">Anderson 2013</a>), knowledge infrastructure (see: <a href="#bowker2017">Bowker 2017</a>), scholarly (information) infrastructure (see: <a href="#borgman2007">Borgman 2007</a>), academic infrastructure (preferred by Svensson as the one carrying fewer connotations with science – see: <a href="#svensson2016">Svensson 2016</a>). I find it fruitful not to reduce the complexity evidenced by this rich terminology and mesh together the insights coming from these different approaches. As far as the humanities are concerned, although it could be useful to grasp specificity of specialized facilities, tools, resources, institutions and standards supporting research in the humanities, in some cases we may as well resort to a more generic understanding of infrastructure (bearing in mind that research infrastructures tend to be layered upon or entangled with other kinds of substrates). Svensson also argues for a rather broad understanding:  “With an inclusive definition of research infrastructure, almost anything needed to carry out research in the humanities could be included: ranging from paper, pens, books, furniture and people to database structures, grid computing facilities, visualization centers and libraries”   <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>. Additionally, it will be discussed further in the paper that the HRAF is in fact illustrative of the porous boundaries between the concept of research infrastructure associated with science and engineering (and often understood as infrastructure tout court) and the humanities infrastructure.&#160;<a href="#fnref:20" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>A relational character of infrastructure (put forward in a canonical work by Star and Ruhleder <a href="#star1996">(1996)</a> and eagerly adopted by others) is understood as an emphasis on  <em>when</em> , not  <em>what</em>  is infrastructure. For Star and Ruhleder that means infrastructure is always embedded in organized practice. Interestingly, relationality entrenched in the concept could also be seen in the origins of the word – according to <a href="#carse2017">Carse (2017, 29)</a>, in the language of the late nineteenth century’s French engineering, infrastructure primarily referred to construction work done prior to laying road tracks and also the very road beds beneath the tracks. Thus rails, trains and train stations – which we commonly imagine as emblematic  <em>infra</em> structure – actually used to serve as  <em>super</em> structure in relation to what was done to make these projects happen.&#160;<a href="#fnref:21" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>What I mean here is that the idea of laboratory could have lost traction in the anthropological meta-discourse due to a growing impact of phenomenology and hermeneutics and after the interpretive turn. The latter is exemplified by Clifford Geertz. In his influential  “Thick description”  (in  <em>The Interpretation of Cultures</em> ) published in 1973, Geertz remained antagonistic to such a mode of scholarship in which anthropologists construct models, study cultures as if they were natural experiments and adopt a concept of the natural laboratory;  “what kind of a laboratory is it where  <em>none</em>  of the parameters are manipulable?”  – asked Geertz provocatively <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>, polemically alluding to the structuralist anthropology.

<p>We could ponder on the possible ramifications of this imported nature of the  <em>Files</em> , produced (selected and annotated) in the United States and used at a French academic institution.

Could the Anglo-American pedigree of the tool have invited criticism (if we bear in mind the situation of the social sciences in post-war France described by Loyer – they are said to have been underfunded, supported by UNESCO and frowned upon by the Marxist left, who  “looked very unfavorably on these  American  sciences of capitalist social engineering”   <sup id="fnref6:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>)?

<p>Reporting on how new higher education policies – oriented toward modernization and triggering influx of money for social sciences – in Gaullist France had shaped the research agenda of the LAS, Loyer touches on several state-sponsored projects in the 1960s and 1970s joined by members of the Laboratory. One example is the interdisciplinary, collective and multiyear study on Plozévet, a French village in Brittany, where the LAS researchers conducted anthropology of the contemporary rural communities. Loyer points out that Lévi-Strauss was not personally too keen on such research (mostly for methodological reasons), nonetheless he grasped these fieldwork missions as strategically important means of bringing in funds, creating new posts as well as gaining recognition for the consolidating discipline.

<p>Given Lévi-Strauss’ scientistic ambitions, one could argue that it is possible to consider LAS an imitation of a scientific laboratory and not a fully-fledged human sciences (let alone humanities) institution. Of course, any clear-cut answers would depend both on the definition of the humanities applied and the academic tradition (which, for example, deploy different names, such as the human sciences and humanities) used to contextualize the argument. If we consider that the LAS is an example of the scientification of the humanities, we should be cognizant of the conditions of this process which may be not be symmetrical to what is happening in today’s scholarship. On the contemporary scientification of the humanities in relation to the laboratory see: <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:56" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:57">
<p>It is not only language making up a picturesque image of the lab. This metaphor could also materialize in a physical form – consider Lévi-Strauss’s awe and fascination with a former geology lab, in which buildings he installed the LAS (Place Marcelin-Berthelot). He marveled at its mahogany cabinets storing mineral collections, elegant, sturdy furniture and aura of the mid-nineteenth century laboratory. He said affectionately:  “Nowhere else, I thought, would I rather spend my days than in these spacious, silent, and secret rooms”   <sup id="fnref11:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. I would argue that we could think of these spaces as epistemic surroundings, which Mario Wimmer describes as places where one could think with what is at hand and these spatial arrangements shape the very process of thinking. He writes on the material concepts and is interested in how they contribute to knowing on a more unconscious level:  “My basic assumption is that this surplus of meaning is an effect of both the excess of the materiality of language, as well as the experience that emerges in the process of research but which cannot be translated into scholarly discourse and thus enters, in its symbolic-material form, the epistemic surroundings where it acquires a latent existence”   <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>.

</li>
<li id="fn:58">
<p>As for the laboratorial Zeitgeist and the origins of the idea for the LAS, it is rather unclear whether Lévi-Strauss’s lab was inspired by the American cybernetics centers like MIT’s CENIS and Research Laboratory of Electronics which Strauss was familiar with and even engaged in some cooperation. As documented in his letters to Jakobson, in the early 1950s Lévi-Strauss sought funding in the US to open in France a center for structuralist analysis undergirded by cybernetics. As discussed by Geoghegan and Loyer, it is not probable that the LAS was a direct realization of these plans.&#160;<a href="#fnref:58" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Jason Pribilsky interpreted a famous cartoon by Maurice Henry depicting the great French intellectuals – Foucault, Derrida, Barthes and Lévi-Strauss, with his nose in papers – asking a question (of a rather rhetorical nature) if Strauss was actually  “lost in the pages of Human Relations Area Files”   <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>.

<p>But such collaboration did not result in co-authored publications. Speaking of collective work, Lévi-Strauss pointed to his seminar:  “our weekly seminar can become the meeting place for a team whose members, already united by other ties, can thus keep each other informed of their individual work. It goes without saying that this collaboration supposes a certain unity of views, without, however, excluding a doctrinal independence. The unity results from the fact that whether to get inspiration or to combat them, the participants readily take as terms of reference the ideas that we, ourselves, continue to develop in both our lectures at the Collège and the discussions - often very lively - which occupy the last part of each seminar”   <sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:64" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Actually, reconstructing the critical arguments against the  <em>Files</em>  and analyzing how they changed throughout the years would be of value. I would just like to point to Joseph Tobin’s interesting piece  “The HRAF as Radical Text?”  (1990), which is a truly tongue-in-cheek interpretation of the  <em>Files</em>  as reactionary in a political and also epistemological sense, but stylistically radical. Tobin shows that in the course of the interpretive turn in anthropology (after  <em>Writing Culture</em> ), HRAF was dismissed as uncool, dull and falsely scientific. But even before there were considerable objections to it voiced by British anthropologists. Tobin argues it shows a transatlantic rift between visions of how anthropological theory should be built. What was artless  “tabulated nonsense”  for Edmund Leach (Cambridge), remains a valid behavioral sciences theory created by analyzing causal relationships between variables for his American colleagues using Cross-Cultural Survey and disapproving British anthropology for being  “overwhelmingly humanistic” , descriptive and intuitive (cited in: <a href="#tobin1990">Tobin 1990, 478</a>).&#160;<a href="#fnref:66" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Rabinow et al. founded the Laboratory for the Anthropology of the Contemporary (LAC). A striking resemblance to the LAS is most certainly unintentional here, but the idea provokes us to think of the similarities and dissimilarities between the two endeavors.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The question of future access to knowledge production was asked long before the digital era. The risk of losing (analogue) data dates back to before digitisation and care was reinforced for example through transfer of data onto magnetic strips before computer memory storage <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. However, data preservation has recently attracted new attention within research: questions of sharing data and reproducibility of science, open access and maintenance have become more and more pertinent as the websites and digital productions come of age. 404 not found messages now replace a growing number of hyperlinks, and the Web as scientific platform is full of digital wastelands, caused by the end of research projects. As underlined by Smithies and al.,  “finding a comprehensive and scalable approach to sustainable development in digital humanities labs is a non-trivial problem”   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2011, the Manifesto for Digital Humanities has made a plea  “for open access to data and metadata, which must be documented and interoperable, both technically and conceptually”   <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Transdisciplinary studies published around the same time underline that  “sustainability challenges require new ways of knowledge production,”  recommending a collaborative approach and new scientific agencies in the academic field <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Without doubt, the challenge of sustainability has turned into a key concern for the field of digital humanities at large as illustrated by the theme choosen by the Digital matters (an interdisciplinary research agenda) at the University of Utah.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  Large scale research infrastructures such as Huma-Num, Dariah and OPERAS<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  seriously consider the sustainability of humanities and social sciences (HSS) research, and funding bodies increasingly make data management plans a must in research applications.</p>
<p>As defined by the Stanford Libraries:  “A data management plan (DMP) is a written document that describes the data you expect to acquire or generate during the course of a research project, how you will manage, describe, analyse, and store those data, and what mechanisms you will use at the end of your project to share and preserve your data.” <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  These sentences underline that data management is not just about the data that are used, but also about those, which are produced (metadata, results of research, etc.). In fact, data management covers the whole life cycle of a research project, from data selection to their curation and description, from analyse and interpreting data to its publication and long term storage. Therefore, a sustainable stewardship of research data includes a strategy for the readability, maintenance and transparency of those data <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. While this plea for data stewardship – often based on the FAIR principles (FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, see <a href="#wilkinson2016">Wilkinson et al. 2016</a> and <a href="#mons2018">Mons 2018</a>) – has become a shared ambition in earth or climate sciences, it remains a theoretical discussion rather than a shared practice in the field of humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>This paper will focus in particular on HSS, in order to uncover the centrality of this question and the diversity of the researchers’ responses to the many challenges at stake. The aim is to give a voice to researchers from different disciplines that are basically facing the same problems when it comes to data management issues and the question of sustainability. The present study examines all stages of research, from data collection to the dissemination of knowledge, and underlines that challenges are not limited to the technical maintenance of software, tools and data, but also apply to the wider institutional contexts, epistemic traditions and social practices in which the doing of research in humanities and social sciences are embedded. As highlighted by <a href="#bachimont2017">Bachimont (2017)</a>, a loss of intelligibility - that is an understanding of the context in which data are generated and interpreted – is as critical as the technical or material loss of data, if not more. Therefore, the topic at stake necessitates a broader reflection on the institutional, economic and political dimensions of knowledge production, dissemination and conservation in the digital era <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In order to identify the conflicts between the ephemeral, the flow of data, and the safeguarding of knowledge production for future needs, our analysis is largely based on personal experiences of French researchers in the field of digital studies. A qualitative survey was submitted to senior colleagues in the field who have carried out larger research projects and as such responsible for maintaining and preserving data. The survey includes colleagues working in disciplines such as history, information and communication studies, digital humanities, and linguistics. In total, twenty colleagues answered our indicative interview-based online survey<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  in the period between May 2018 and October 2018. The survey included five open questions concerning data access, methods and tools of data gathering and curation, approaches to data preservation, reflections on sustainability, and the place devoted to long-term preservation. Longer face-to-face or telephone interviews were carried out with ten respondents in order to dig deeper into specific questions or problems raised in the survey.</p>
<p>The aim of our project was not to produce strict guidelines for sustainable data management for open science in the field of social sciences or humanities. We fully agree with <a href="#smithies2019">Smithies et al. (2019)</a> that complex projects may share common and generic solutions, but also often need to rely on  <em>ad hoc</em>  solutions, taking into account the specific characteristics of a research project. We therefore want to emphasise the need to think about sustainability as a key element of digital hermeneutics, encompassing the critical reflection on the epistemic role of data management and stewardship in the entire life cycle of knowledge production and dissemination <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. In promoting this holistic approach, we aim at addressing the inherent tension between different temporalities at stake: between the long-term needs of data preservation and maintenance on the one side, and the paradoxically short life cycles of the data formats, platforms and infrastructures on the other side. We seek to explore these tensions between the necessary stability and reproducibility <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> of research and the instability of the digital domain it depends on at several levels and temporalities. The often-contradictory logics of these different temporalities will be discussed in a multilevel perspective, including the institutional, human and technical dimensions of a phenomenon we qualify as fading away. This study therefore considers three key stages in research – namely data access and building a corpus, establishing a research framework and analysis, and finally the use/dissemination of results.</p>
<h2 id="1-from-data-access-to-corpus-building">1. From data access to corpus building</h2>
<p>“There are a great number of difficulties. The API of Facebook, a semi-private, semi-public social network, prevents automatic data crawling and makes the archiving of data a tedious process that involves numerous screenshots and the difficulty of organising manually collected data. I also encountered difficulties linked to the plasticity of devices and therefore the loss of data: the closure of pages or Facebook profiles, deleted comments or posts&hellip; as well as problems related to ethical issues for data collection: what data can I use, and how? Does access to  private  data also permit the use of said data? Is the consent of the respondents sufficient to publish the data?”  (ICS interview, July 2018).</p>
<p>By explaining her working methods, this scholar in information and communication studies highlights realities that are frequently invisible in research papers and remain hidden from public view: digital studies are more often than is usually assumed a mixture of science and handicraft, a kind of  “thinkering”   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> process which involves several challenges and difficulties along the way, and whose solutions may sometimes be very manual, empirical and pragmatic. This is far from the methodology which may then be outlined in a published paper, but this hidden struggling and the iterative logic of science in the making remains a reality for many research projects that are characterised by a mixed method and hands-on learning by doing approach trying to deal with screenshots, time-consuming manual curation, changing access conditions, obsolete hyperlinks, unclear legislation – in short, the normal grappling with the instability of data, devices, and tools.</p>
<h2 id="11-diversity-and-instability-of-data-search-and-gathering">1.1 Diversity and instability of data search and gathering</h2>
<p>Researchers using digital data in the field of humanities and social sciences mainly work with social media data originating from commercial platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. These data are often collected in real time. In the following paragraph, we will discuss some French examples of such projects in order to highlight the different possibilities of scraping or gathering online data and to reflect on both the opportunities and challenges that come with the different approaches.</p>
<p>Twitter-data are certainly one of the favourite digital-born sources to be studied by digital humanists. French examples are the study carried out by <a href="#badouard2016">Badouard (2016)</a> on the #jenesuispasCharlie hashtag after the attacks against the editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, and Frédéric Clavert’s project on the commemorations of the First World War <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. As noticed by Dagiral and Pailler,  “one of the main constraints in building corpus from Twitter is the inability to obtain the entire stream, even for an extremely short period of time; there is not technical reason for this restriction, which actually results from the choices made when designing the site”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> (our translation). In order to have the entire stream, Twitter does offer the researchers to purchase data. However, this option strongly depends of available funding and raises some concerns about research ethics as well.</p>
<p>Next to the rather time-consuming tasks of building ones own dataset, researcher mostly rely on available data, which are shared online, often through platforms such as Github<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  or through special collections made available by archives, libraries, and other cultural heritage institutions. In 2010, the Library of Congress (LoC) reached an agreement with Twitter to archive all the tweets issued since 2006 <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. It took the library until 2013 to complete the data collection for the period 2006-2010 – a fact demonstrating the enormous time and work required for indexing such a vast dataset. The volume of data (170 billion tweets and more than 300 terabytes of information from 2006 to 2010) led the LoC to announce in December 2017 that it would restrict collection to data concerning specific themes and events. For technical reasons but also ethical (consent) and legal (privacy rights) issues, data collected by the LoC are still not available to researchers <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, other institutions with smaller perimeters are offering access to Twitter collections. Examples include the archives of the INA (French National Institute for Audiovisual) and the BnF (French National Library), which are both related to the French Internet legal deposit. These institutions do not collect all the Twitter data, but have Twitter archives linked to their archiving perimeters. Although these archives are really valuable, they are biased on choices that do not necessarily coincide with the expectations of researchers. One respondent to our survey revealed the potential use of the French BnF archives, whilst underlining certain limitations:  “I generally find it very difficult to work on traces, and particularly old ones. I use the BnF web archives, but the search tool isn’t very good. On top of that, anything that isn’t from ‘public’ pages isn’t archived”  (ICS interview, May 2018). This may lead to research questions that are based on the availability of relevant archives (thus merely updating questions that researchers have already been aware of for some time).  “The idea of the patrimonial value of web content”  influences the criteria for safeguarding data and  “threatens the existence of content that does not fit the criteria set by web archiving organisations for the preservation of data [&hellip;]. Certain contents and formats can also be excluded – this is particularly true of images in 1990s web archives, and also banner advertising and pop-ups”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This small overview of the ways researchers can access social networks sources (researcher&rsquo;s collect, use of sample made by others, purchase of data, institution’s collections) already underline several challenges in terms of sustainability and highlight several temporalities at stake:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers (and librarians) who collect data in real time in Twitter run the risk of lacking distance and potentially overlooking important trends. As explained by Thomas Drugeon, who works at INA in France and launched an emergency Twitter collection during the Charlie Hebdo attack in 2015:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I added hashtags to the collection at lunchtime on the day after the events in the editorial offices at Charlie Hebdo. We acted more quickly for the events of 13 November. The Twitter flows weren’t organised in quite the same way either. The hashtags were more varied in November, whereas in January nearly everything was concentrated on the #jesuischarlie hashtag. In November, at least five hashtags emerged and we could observe movements, cycles too, for example day/night reflecting the different time zones at international level. For #jesuischarlie we missed the peak at the beginning. [&hellip;] Valérie Schafer: And did you also collect #jesuisahmed, #jenesuispascharlie? Thomas Drugeon: No, we didn’t capture them ourselves, but we could access them indirectly, as a side effect. We didn’t want to start adding hashtags along the way as we wanted to make sure that we would have a homogeneous set.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Researchers who react after an event will not be able to fully access data unless they buy them from Twitter or use datasets which were created by others (where available), may they be individuals or librarians. Researchers then face other challenges: although the datasets may be documented, stressing the importance of metadata <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, they are reliant on the choices of others – maybe even robots.</li>
<li>As pointed out by Thomas Bottini and Virginie Julliard, who used INA archives to analyze the semiotic dimension of the gender theory controversy that played out on Twitter,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  researchers need to  “consider the often non-explicit archiving logic of these databases, as well as changes in their architecture and editorial policies”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. The massive availability of data in archiving collections is not synonymous with  “turnkey”  corpora <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> as collecting involves specific criteria and curation, which claim for a knowledge of archiving choices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coping with the sheer volume of data is a further challenge. The Info-RSN project, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR), which focused on the circulation and sharing of information on Twitter and changes in journalism <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, may help to illustrate this problem. The researchers used a private company to collect the data, i.e. all the tweets that contained a URL link to one of the 31 French news entities included in the survey. The raw data collected corresponded to roughly 40 million tweets, and it took one and a half years to develop tools and ultimately obtain a final corpus of 17 million tweets (after the elimination of duplicates and tweets that were outside the research criteria).</p>
<p>From a methodological point of view, building large datasets renews the traditional criteria mobilised for the constitution of research corpora (representativeness, exhaustiveness, homogeneity, etc.). The heterogeneous nature of data (alphanumeric, audio, visual or timestamped data), their ephemerality (including for the short term), the design-specific limitations of platforms (websites, socio-digital networks, internet portals), and finally the hardware-specific nature of devices and means of reception (computers, tablets, smartphones) make corpus-building a highly complex and critical hermeneutic practice. For researchers working with open access datasets, it can be difficult to detect the blind spots of a search query or to reconstruct the selection criteria that have informed the creation of the corpus. The archiving of Twitter by the BnF and INA can serve as a speaking example here again. INA compiles its archive through the public Twitter API, whereas the BnF uses Heritrix - the crawler also used by Internet Archive and many libraries around the world. The results are very different in terms of data as well as metadata: the BnF’s Twitter archives look more like screenshots, whereas the INA collections are more flexible, allowing comparisons of metadata while giving access to results that no longer look like the original tweet. This may be a disadvantage or not, depending on the type of research being conducted: studying a Facebook or Twitter news feed from a semiotic and discursive point of view requires being able to retain the format of the broadcast.</p>
<p>Despite their apparent accessibility digitised texts also raise challenges. Some of them are common with born-digital heritage. Some databases are unstable over time. This is the case of private press databases like Factiva,<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  which depend on agreements concluded between the publisher of the database and the owners of the data that is collected. Digitisation is not neutral either, and affects the digitised text <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> from a semiotic point of view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The source text [&hellip;] is then turned into various types of semiotic text, including a first, the digital text per se, in which it is encoded using 0s and 1s. This text is generally illegible for humans. A second, known as an image text, can be displayed on a screen or printed on paper and read as such, but any analysis of this version is typically manual. Then come the dynamic text, the annotated text and the edited text, and finally the readable, analysable text. So [&hellip;] digitisation does not produce a single digital copy of the text, but an entire galaxy of digitised texts which, interlinked and organised hierarchically, open up new avenues for interpretation and analysis.<br>
<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> Factiva, for example, collects and digitises the texts without preserving the layout and format of distribution. These choices should be accessible to researchers whether they are stable or not. Etienne Brunet compared the Frantext<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  textual database with the French works on Google books. Frantext provides the researcher with a defined and explicit database for collection criteria <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dealing with datasets as sources for humanities and social sciences research not only requires a critical understanding of the production and indexical logic of databases and its structured information, but also a hermeneutic reflection on the dual nature of digital data as both content  <em>and</em>  form.  “When working with digital objects it’s essential to remember that what they look like on the screen is a performance,”  says Trevor Owens <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>, head of the Digital Content Management department at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. Next to the challenge of determining the authenticity of data in terms of their physical integrity, one has to consider the performative volatility of data representations in different formats and on different devices. New skills such as interface criticism which make us think about the framing of  “in-form-ation”   <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> are therefore necessary in order to critically evaluate the  “integrity of representation”  of digital data <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, there is also the question of internal metadata and of metadata <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> added by the researcher during her/his annotations. Regarding the first ones, let’s mention the case of retweets. Although retweets are useful to study the popularity or even the virality of a tweet, the number of retweets that researchers may find in Web archives is linked to the exact time the tweet was archived, meaning that they may miss the real popularity of a given tweet if it was archived at the beginning of its dissemination and before the climax of its popularity. Regarding the second ones <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>, the durability of taxonomies and their readability remain a central question: the choice of metadata and taxonomy is not always stable even within an organisation and this can make longitudinal or diachronic approaches more difficult, as the researcher has to consider not only changes in the Web, but also in its archiving, interfaces, supports, algorithms, descriptions and taxonomies. A rigorous documentation of metadata is therefore needed to facilitate searchability, analysis and quotations.</p>
<h2 id="12-long-term-preservation-trial-and-error">1.2 Long-term preservation, trial and error</h2>
<p>Another question we addressed in our surveys is: what happens to the data at the end of the project? In the field of biology, Timothy H. Vines and his team conducted a survey on data sustainability through the analysis of 516 articles published from 1991 to 2011. They noted that scientific data are lost two years after the publication of an article, after which the chances of accessing scientific data would fall by 17% per year. This was mainly due to the failure of storage tools or obsolete email addresses that prevented any contact with the authors <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Is the situation different in social sciences and humanities? Probably not! The answers to our survey show a great difficulty when it comes to implementing a sustainable storage and sharing approach in a medium and the long-term perspective (i.e. periods of up to ten years or beyond ten years, respectively).</p>
<p>A first finding of ours is, that testimonials show a focus on the “here and now” rather than on future uses of research data. The mastering of data and tools is often driven by a learning-by-doing approach, shifting the focus to pragmatic solutions rather than investing time into more fundamental speculations about open science in a sustainable perspective. Many researchers highlight the large amount of short-term difficulties:  “I don’t have much time to think about the long term, because I am too busy with my current collection and analysis problems! And above all, I don’t have the time or the technical means to go into it in detail”  (ICS interview, May 2018). However, many of the scholars interviewed keep screenshots on their computers and external hard drives. They do their own archiving, but without sharing it or without any guarantee that they will be able to transfer their archives from one machine to another in order to preserve the data. This problem is sometimes solved by the use of online storage and sharing tools (OwnCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, Huma-Num),  “for practical reasons but without any real thought about the long term, especially after the project has ended”  (ICS interview, July 2018).</p>
<p>But doing research is of course an iterative process that comes with a lot of surprises and unforeseen challenges which force the researcher to adapt methods and tools as the project progresses. It would be an error to underestimate the researcher’s adaptability and flexibility in this regard. As one historian confessed:  “My current project (traces of the First World War on Twitter) was not originally designed as a research project. So initially, data archiving, storage and so on were not part of my plan. Today, they are increasingly central to my reasoning, as the project will end in 2019. For archiving, I can use the DH Now project. I also think that adapting to the GDPR is something to contemplate for the long term”  (History interview, May 2018).</p>
<p>In terms of maintenance let’s return to the trio of data, corpus and results we underlined: they all can have similar stakes, but they involve different actors, research problems and management methods. Institutions such as the BnF preserve the data, without necessarily keeping the corpus created by the researchers. This complementary approach is currently being explored in the Internet Lab platform (made available to the researchers of the Web90 and ASAP projects in 2016), or in the prospective study conducted by <a href="#moiraghi2018">Moiraghi (2018)</a>. Although data maintenance can be carried out by legal repositories and institutions, it can also be a private sector initiative, for example, for the Newsgroups of the Usenet community: these exchanges between early adopters of computer-mediated communications are a rich source of information for digital historians, and the maintenance of this data is entirely dependent upon Google’s interest in preserving these exchanges. Yet users were rapidly disappointed by the organisation of these archives, which were experienced as unclear and difficult to use and search <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. Camille Paloque-Bergès notes that  “the non-standardised archives of the Web are the result of the succession of transitional and informal states of digitalised document cycles; this succession is due to the development of  wild  documentation on the Internet before professional archivists started their work”   <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The problem of citability of research data and final research outputs is of course not a new one. As Emmanuelle Bermès (BnF) noted, this concern existed way before the era of digitalisation: from 2006 onwards, the BnF was concerned about the sustainability of identifiers, notably for websites. A choice had to be made between opaque identifiers based on existing standards such as UUID (Universal Unique Identifier), or more significant identifiers that facilitated the citability and accessibility of resources.  “This duality illustrates the problem libraries have always had: the dilemma of choosing between communication and conservation”   <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> (our translation). There are further issues to address:  “Indeed, sustainability and unicity both have a problem of scale. It is now commonly accepted that identifiers can be reused for different websites or even destroyed on the web. Sustainability cannot therefore be considered as ensuring that data is ‘eternal’, but rather that it  lasts long enough  for the needs of the institution managing the resource”  (<a href="#berm%C3%A8s2006">idem</a>). Sustainability therefore involves other challenges such as the independence of the authority maintaining the data or the ability to integrate pre-existing models and envision post-existing models.</p>
<p>Maintenance requires the consideration of both the temporality of the research questions, methods, and tools and of the stakeholders and users involved. It requires time, effort and resources that are rarely available to researchers if not planned from the outset. It is rare for the researcher’s institution to carry out this maintenance. Researchers may therefore decide to rely on  <em>ad hoc</em>  solutions. However, the question of the responsibility for data preservation remains: within an institutional framework, research is not the sole property of researchers. They could rightly argue that there is a mutual obligation of maintenance within the institution they have developed their research. Yet such solutions have been more often provided for article repositories and platforms than for research data. In this respect a system like HAL<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  in France offers an effective response that is increasingly used by researchers for making articles available through open access (preprints, author drafts, final publications, etc.). Similarly, sound archive repositories, like the Phonothèque at the MMSH (the Maison méditerranéenne des sciences de l’homme, or Mediterranean Centre for Humanities),<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  offer a means of heritagising and preserving collections. But there are hardly any integrated solutions for projects using heterogeneous data. It is worth noting that various new solutions are under consideration at national level in France, for example the  “feasibility study for a [shared] warehousing service for simple data.” <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  The way this study will deal with  “Big Data, Little Data, No Data”   <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> and with the precise scope of simple data remains to be seen, as in practice it is generally for complex data that researchers need help and support. But there are also question marks as to the need to create new solutions rather than building on existing ones proposed by research infrastructures in this area and to the utility of a nationwide scheme for an issue that is of international or global scope (not least because of cross-border research projects).</p>
<h2 id="2-conflicting-temporalities-and-distributed-materialities">2. Conflicting temporalities and distributed materialities</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the different temporalities of research practices and preservation initiatives have to be problematised in order to tackle the problem of readability and intelligibility of research data in a long-term perspective. Dealing with digital sources or data in terms of sustainability requires taking into consideration the historicity of the  “layered”  or  “distributed”  materiality <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> of digital datasets and objects, which is characterised by the interweaving of hardware and software environments. As Johanna Drucker has stressed,  “the distributed concept requires attention to the many layers and relationships of hardware, software, bandwidth, processing, storage, memory, and other factors. The distributed approach registers a shift from materiality grounded in a single feature or factor to an approach based on multiple systems of interrelated activity”   <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Although the interviews show that the colleagues interviewed take various dimensions of the distributed materiality of digital artefacts into account, the solutions are fragmented and often specific to individual researchers or a project, rather than shared and disseminated.</p>
<h2 id="21-tools-evolution-and-obsolescence">2.1 Tools’ evolution and obsolescence</h2>
<p>The interviews we conducted indicate that researchers use a wide range of data analysis tools (Nvivo, Iramuteq, Gephi, etc.), and also reveal tools developed by researchers. Thomas Bottini and Virginie Julliard developed their own tool to observe the semiotic dimension of the controversy around gender studies on Twitter. This raises the question of the long-term registration of these  “custom-made”  tools, their diffusion and their readability in the medium term <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. This is true for the case of the Calico project (communities of e-learning, instrumentation and collaboration), which ran from 2006 to 2009 and examined distance learning platforms and online discussion lists <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. A set of analytical tools were developed during this project which are no longer available – be it because of professional mobility of researchers or the lack of funding to maintain the tools. This lack of sustainability directly affects the readability and the intelligibility of the results of this research project.</p>
<p>As noticed by J. Smithies and al.  “digital projects benefit from being planned and executed with their longevity in mind from the start”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The consideration of collection environments and conditions as well as the documentation work may enrich reflections on the choices of the observable elements <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> and the choice of methodologies <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. A good illustration of this point is an ANR-funded research project on online petitioning. The research group behind this project (Pluridisciplinary Analysis of On Line Petitioning) had access to data from one of the main French-speaking online petitioning websites (lapetition.be): the dataset included 12,000 petitions which had received a total of 3.25 million signatures over the period between 31 October 2006 and 12 February 2015. The richness of the data (data entered by Internet users and generated by the system), as well as their heterogeneity (alphanumeric data, number of signatories, site sections and forms, etc.), led to the development of different approaches, both qualitative (interviews with the designer, manual analyses) and quantitative (textual statistical tools), in order to look at the characteristics of online petitioning as well as the limitations and incentives induced by the system that affect the petitioning dynamic. The interviews proved to be essential in order to assess the stability of the system over time and avoid bias in interpreting the collected data. Before the end of the project, i.e. 2018, the website was no longer accessible, confirming the importance of taking screenshots in order to be able to contextualise the data <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. This example underlines the crucial importance of documentation – and the emergence of data stewards as a new and promising profession in the field of digital humanities. As query tools evolve over time and can thus change data collection conditions, a professional documentation of the creation of research data should not only provide technical information (standards, protocols, formats), but must include search modalities used to constitute the corpora. The lack of  “thick description”  of both the metadata and the process of gathering, curating, and publishing or recontextualising research data is certainly one of the biggest risks when it comes to the long-term and sustainable contribution of digital humanities research to the long tradition of  “analogue”  knowledge production in humanities and social sciences <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Until now, historians had been probably better protected from the obsolescence of their sources than their counterparts working with contemporary data, but they are now increasingly concerned by this risk. The ANR Web90<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  project carried out from 2014 to 2018 is a prime example: when it was launched in 2014, searches conducted in the Web archives (may it be the Wayback Machine of Internet Archive or collections of national institutions) only allowed URL requests. Subsequently, the BnF implemented a full-text search in its archives, thus widening the search capacities, affecting the results and influencing data analysis. In addition to changes in data access and the consequent disruption caused by full text and the possibility of classifying the results according to different facets (time, format, domain name), other additional tools provided an answer to a blatant problem: the temporally disparate composition of archived pages, which included anachronistic elements that had not been updated (for example, calendars that are not routinely re-archived for reasons of duplication, etc) <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. Internet Archive recently introduced a system to date the archives of each element making up a webpage,<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  thus removing the opacity of these temporal patchworks. It is also important to document collection tools - they may sometimes exclude advertisings, gifs or emoticons in the case of automatic collection tools - or consultation terminals that modify the display of data, a central aspect in the case of works that emphasise a semiotic perspective. In the Web archives it should be noted that the fonts and characters may also differ from the original pages, as enlightened by Musiani et al.:  “If at the time of archiving, a Web page font was not written explicitly in its original source code, but rather used by default, the default settings set by the browser in its current version will appear on the archived page”   <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. Archiving data can also remove the original formatting of the platform. This is the case, for example, for Twitter data stored by INA as explained earlier: the form and the interface are not preserved, because the choices that have prevailed favour manageability and interoperability between the data. It is also important to note that the archiving or displaying of data can evolve over time: initially, INA archived emojis but did not display in the results to researchers, thus removing the heterogeneity and complexity of data that is characteristic of web writings <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="22-temporalities-of-users">2.2 Temporalities of users</h2>
<p>One respondent noted that the main difficulty  “is to reconstruct the temporal dynamics of the discussions studied (often I only have access to the final data)”  (ICS interview, May 2018). Elements that have not been collected have to be reconstructed to account for the complexity of the dispositif  <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  and its functionalities. This was undertaken by the INA, who collected data collection limit messages via Twitter’s public API and developed documentation on missing data. Research on the history of the Web has also shown that it is difficult (but not impossible) to identify the users of 1990s Newsgroups and establish their sociological profile, or even to consider the representativeness of their posts. The same question could arise for Twitter’s archives and its users. Preservation is also about the readability of the article in the future. Therefore, one should also consider future users. A publication may describe facts that may no longer be readable/understandable fifty years later, as the digital environment studied has evolved or even disappeared. If we imagine, for example, the disappearance of Twitter, how could we guarantee the documentation of the data in such a way as to reproduce their context and their techno-semiotic environment? This is already the case when reading an article about the Minitel - a videotext system broadly used in the 80s and 90s in France, with students, especially strangers to the French context, who have absolutely no knowledge of the technical ecosystem and the small beige box. Some current analyses can be difficult to understand even now: hyperlink analysis and maps can lack readability, for example in the field of scientific controversies when the data are not visible. This difficulty could be further accentuated if Gephi, Iramuteq or Lexico, are no longer usable, or even documentable. If the tools as well as the data disappear, is the analysis still readable? The design of the tools and dispositifs, studied for example by <a href="#monnoyer-smith2016">Monnoyer-Smith (2016)</a> or <a href="#mabi2016">Mabi (2016)</a>, introduce restrictions and develop a specific type of research and results (graphs, clouds, link maps <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>), which also claim for digital hermeneutics.</p>
<p>In addition to the different temporalities of research data and the distributed materiality of the research devices and infrastructures, there are also temporal questions that are specific to the individual experiences of researchers. Amongst the researchers who were especially sensitive to data sustainability in our survey, one colleague – who has the ability to carry out  “ <em>ad hoc</em>  programming and programming for the exploitation of XML databases”  (DH and Language interview, May 2018) – has been particularly attentive to sustainability issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, we deal with the volatility of the data on a day-to-day basis: we have transferred our servers three times. Part of the corpus data is hosted on personal servers, outside the research institutions. However, we are fortunate to have redundant servers in the laboratory that we manage internally: all our data are saved in XML format (txt) that is always accessible and guarantees their use in the long-term, and in a compressed form that goes from one server to another several times a day. In each of our projects, a substantial part of out funding is earmarked for 1 / the legal protection of the data, ensuring the sharing and the diffusion of the data entered (without confiscation) and 2 / the saving of data without a subscription (even if the data is hosted by a provider to avoid giving priority to one university project over another. No cloud storage is used, but hard drives are purchased and CRON backup programming is used on the websites of both project partners, etc.) Each time, the solution is to reinvent, according to the type of financing and the project itself: an editorial project? A pure data project? etc.<br>
(DH and Language Interview, May 2018)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The capacity to think about data maintenance and the constant reworking of ideas seems to develop as soon as the researcher is no longer in discovery mode and fully immersed into the difficult daily control of tools and data (as underlined by one respondent to our survey:  “[&hellip;] It has been more difficult since I started trying to integrate source code into the analysis for critical code studies. However, I am interested in discourse, the practices and the uses - accessing the source code and becoming familiar with it can help to understand the active role code plays in human-machine interactions”  (ICS interview, July 2018)). For those starting a DH-project with rather limited technical or data management skills, the need for support by computer scientists and engineers might be a necessity right from the start of a project. As underlined by a researcher in ICS:  “Accessing (and processing) data seems increasingly dependent either on researchers learning IT methods that are not part of their initial background and that may be costly to acquire, or on working in conjunction with computer scientists (technicians, engineers or researchers) whose methods and research interests may be significantly different. We may therefore witness a narrowing of research aims or questions because of the need to master certain tools”  (ICS Interview, May 2018).</p>
<h2 id="3-open-access-and-digital-wastelands">3. Open Access and Digital Wastelands</h2>
<p>National and international research infrastructures and institutions are seeking to provide answers to the transformations that challenge current research. The French Progedo<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  VRLI (Very Large Research Infrastructure for production and management of data) was created to preserve survey data. In the United States, Harvard University has initiated Dataverse,<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  a social science data storage project intended to facilitate Web access to verified web and non-web data and ensure their preservation <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. Similarly, to name but a few, the CESSDA (Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives) has added sustainability to its main objectives,<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  while OPERAS, a European Research Infrastructure for the development of open scholarly communication in the social sciences and humanities, and COPIM (Community-led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs) have recently been launched.</p>
<p>Despite such initiatives, at present, most born-digital heritage of HSS research is unequally preserved. While mailing lists and some research projects have been particularly well preserved,<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>  a quick look at the archives of digital research projects on the Web reveals many broken links. Some researchers have tackled these issues, including <a href="#nanni2017">Nanni (2017)</a>, who in  “Reconstructing a website’s lost past - Methodological issues concerning the history of <a href="https://www.unibo.it">www.unibo.it</a>”  explains his efforts to rebuild the evolution of the website of the University of Bologna, which has lost much of its content. The challenges linked to the loss of devices or digital materials and software can no longer be ignored; this includes CD Roms during the 80s and 90s, floppy disks, etc. Whilst emulation is often carried out for data archiving, it is rarely achieved for production and valorisation.</p>
<h2 id="31-sharing-and-open-access">3.1 Sharing and Open Access</h2>
<p>Open access is central to the concerns of researchers and of publishers, but is also of importance to European funders, especially in the framework of H2020 projects, thus continuing a movement that began with early initiatives such as ArXiv<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>  in the field of physics or biology. Although this study does not intend to detail the policies of open access in Social and Human Sciences, it is important to note that these policies are a quintessentially economic and political challenges <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. This is a regular subject of debate <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>, which leaves researchers faced with a paradoxical demand:  “first, to publish, then publish more, in highly rated journals, in journals that are increasingly evaluated, graded, ranked and second, to make results public, disseminate them to as many people as possible, get them online as quickly as possible”   <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup> (our translation).</p>
<p>Open access has found its way through platforms like the French multidisciplinary open archive HAL<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>  or the research notebooks platform Hypotheses.<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>  These collaborative efforts have definitely fostered best practices and paved the way for a greater acceptance of open access publication and data sharing. Sure, one could argue that the maintenance and the searchability of these platforms aren’t free from biases and institutional dependences too. However, these biases and dependences appears less worrying than the ones specific for private companies with their opaque and questionable system of ranking, visibility and referencing. Beyond the independence of these academic databases, attention needs to be paid to questions of interoperability of data formats. But like the open access, interoperability comes at a price regarding policies of standardisation, negotiations and debates they may raise, technical developments and implementation, updates, gateways, etc., and the human effort it implies. The question of the economic model is clearly posed when funded researchers can publish articles in open access by paying publishers, while others are prevented from doing so because they are unable to pay the high fees.<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup></p>
<p>The question of open access is crucial at all stages of research: it entails strong constraints (as well as opportunities) for the researcher before, during and after the research process, and requires not only specific means (research engineers, data collection tools and short- and long-term storage) but also a detailed knowledge of the rules applying to data sharing (which were for example renewed within European legislation by the recent GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation).<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  These rules also evolve over time, when some works enter the public domain. Controversy may sometimes appear, as seen in the debates between <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup> and the Anne Frank Foundation. The researcher who currently uses web archives from archival institutions may for her/his part be frustrated by the legal impossibility to copy archives due to intellectual property rights. But he/she can find comfort in the knowledge that they will be traceable through permalinks.</p>
<p>As <a href="#zimmer2010">Zimmer (2010)</a> pointed out in the case of Facebook, this sharing and quotability raise issues of anonymity. Anonymity can be waived by search engines and betrayed by the cited data – despite the best intentions of researchers <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>. It is therefore necessary to anticipate any obstacles to anonymisation, which vary according to the type of data. This difficulty was encountered by the group of researchers working on the ANR-funded project on online petitioning <sup id="fnref2:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>  As mentioned earlier, thanks an agreement with the manager of an e-petitioning platform, this project had access to the entire database and related data (including texts, petitioners, signatories, comments and timestamps) over a period from 2006 to 2016. The data had been previously anonymised (12,000 petitions and more than 3 million signatories). However, the researchers quickly realised that entering the quotation of comments by signatories via the Google search engine provided the same information online. The research team had to carry out multiple online checks to be certain before publication that no quotes or excerpts compromised the anonymity of the data, thus restricting the dissemination of results. In addition, the agreement did not allow them to respond to requests for data sharing. This example is typical of the limits of open access to digital data and of the ethical, technical and legal constraints that influence the dissemination of results.</p>
<h2 id="32-404-not-found-and-other-challenges-raised-by-time">3.2 404 not found and other challenges raised by time</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many great digital humanities projects of the past now suffer from their status as digital wasteland. Many research project websites are just abandoned at the end of the project; others may be frozen. However, freezing a project is not sufficient to maintain it or guarantee its sustainability. A good example is the Amsterdam-project DDS ( <em>De Digital Stad</em> ): an online socializing platform created in Amsterdam in the mid-1990s. A team of media archeologists around Gerard Alberts revived the DDS platform using the data that had been preserved, but identified a number of technical issues despite the precautions previously taken:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 15–16 January 1996, the DDS servers were down for most of the night to allow for a full backup of De Digitale Stad. A full 1-on-1 disk copy of all the servers running DDS was created on 3 Digital Linear Tapes (DLT). DDS congratulated itself with a city frozen in time, preserved to be studied by archaeologists in a distant future: the FREEZE. [&hellip;] In restoring old data, it soon came to light that the package would not simply unwrap, or defrost. The DLT tapes holding the FREEZE did not easily render their content.<br>
<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup> The planning of the DDS founders here was remarkable. However, being prepared is not always sufficient to avoid risk. One survey respondent described how the earmarking of funds to store data beyond the end of an international research project was still insufficient to keep the data available on the medium term:  “The data was hosted by a university institution which could no longer cover the costs of data storage, leading to the loss of all the data. We had planned the financing of data maintenance, but the funding was limited to a ten-year period and could only be temporarily extended, leading to the loss of data that could have been used for future research”  (ICS interview, June 2018).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we know, many projects stop abruptly or are no longer updated. Although their short-term fate could be considered better than that of the many websites that simply disappear, the high risk of the data disappearing has resulted in multiple preservation efforts. For example, the European Publications Office keeps information about European projects within the CORDIS database,<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>  and the websites of these projects can provide extremely useful data for funding bodies, stakeholders or historians interested in the history of science or of the European Union. This determination is also shown by the arquivo.pt website of the Portuguese web archives, which has made an effort to preserve European R &amp; D websites.<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup></p>
<p>Some past projects give the feeling that research productions are out of date, but they reflect the state of the digital art of the period: a pioneering 3D production in 1980 rapidly appears to be well below current levels of achievements. Something that was a technical feat in its time becomes one of the first steps of a technique (which may be extremely relevant for analysis by a historian of science). This brings us to a wider examination of obsolescence over time for certain projects and the evaluation of the maintenance efforts necessary to avoid it: this raised the issue of digital databases or research outcomes based on paid images and royalties that must be negotiated on a regular basis.</p>
<p>It also highlights the broader notion of updatism <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>, which seems inherent to the conflicting temporalities of digital studies. Yet the updating of websites and data are different things. The second case can be illustrated by the Twitter archives concerning the terrorist attacks that occurred in France over the last few years. These archives continue to grow, particularly at INA, as the hashtags are reused by users for tweets about different terrorist attacks or for commemorations, thus continuously producing new results. While living archives are more and more developing <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>, updatism is a new challenge that may affect the perimeters, the temporalities of projects and even reviews (possibly claiming for post publication reviews<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>  as a way to reflect the evolving nature of data and knowledge).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>“Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”  This definition of the concept was formulated by the Brundtland Commission in 1987, as commissioned by the UN.ℍ.<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup></p>
<p>This definition of sustainable development could be a useful line of thinking in the field of human and social sciences, even if it was not designed for this domain. Let us take the current example of INA’s policy to homogenise the data and metadata resulting from the archiving of socio-digital networks (for example between Twitter and Facebook). As explained by Jérôme Thièvre (INA Web Legal Deposit), web archivists aim to create common metadata to access Twitter and Facebook archives, despite being faced with two different environments and dispositifs. But their work has two different goals: beyond the homogenisation of this data / metadata to meet the current needs of consultation and cross-checking, they also consider keeping other metadata in the  “back office,”  behind the scenes, that are not currently available to the researcher but which could be made accessible and used for future needs <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>By making the researcher’s  “toolbox”  readable and explaining her/his  “ways of doing things”   <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>, the working environment and the temporality of the research are documented for the long term. This sometimes requires a certain curiosity for aspects that can be understated, obscured or considered of little value in the production of knowledge but could yet play a role in reinforcing the reflective approach that is central to research. The question of the long duration of research in comparison to the short cycles of digital innovations and the rapid evolution of devices, tools and dispositifs requires to include thinking about sustainability into our critical tradition of hermeneutics. Many examples in our article are based on born-digital data, although some issues are common to retro-digitised archives or digitised collections. However, all these cases involve a number of different temporalities (that of data, infrastructure, tools, devices, hardware and software, media, research, institutions and funding) and multi-stakeholder issues that require collective reflection to clearly identify the actors and locations that are best adapted to implement and support the challenges of data sustainability. These challenges are deeply transdisciplinary, as evidenced by the responses of researchers in ICS, history, sociology, and linguistics.</p>
<p>Yet they are also interdisciplinary: they require an answer that calls for archivists and librarians, ethical and legal approaches and involvement of disciplinary expertise. They also claim for awareness-raising and training for researchers, who describe the constant tension of dealing with current challenges whilst anticipating future issues in research, infrastructure, ethical, legal and political terms. This necessary interdisciplinarity poses many difficulties, such as the development of a common language that goes beyond technical jargon, as illustrated by the difficulties the Bamboo project faced in the United States <sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>. Finally, these challenges call for taking into account the highly internationalised research framework and several environments, such as national data protection regulations, where access and protection need to be reconciled, and where regulations can also make certain agencies obsolete. All these questions are strongly linked to constantly changing legal matters, which are sometimes interpreted in a way, as seen in the narrow opposition between the right to memory and the right to be forgotten that  <a href="#dulong2017">Dulong de Rosnay and Gadamuz (2017)</a> deconstructed.</p>
<p>This is also a social and political challenge that brings to light not only funding, but also capitalisation on existing structures and scientific legacy to avoid the duplication of means, supports and tools. From here onwards, what was seen as the constraint of sustainability becomes the challenge to attain efficiency, sharing and responsibility,<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>  aiming to also address the inherently ethical issues that could be framed as  “sustainability ethics”   <sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>  Although Smithies and al. noticed that  “maintenance and archiving of digital scholarship is an iterative, continuous process, that does not allow for perfect endings”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, this maintenance, which is well studied in infrastructures such as transport <sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>, should be better considered and studied in the domain of knowledge infrastructures. We fully agree with <a href="#russell2018">Russell and Vinsel (2018)</a> and the maintainers’ group, who speak out against the fascination with prioritising innovation over maintenance. Instead of promoting the rhetorics of newness and digital revolution, one should pay more attention to the danger of digital obsolescence and the massive fading away of digital data and knowledge.</p>

<p>As underlined by their abstract,  “this paper sets out the method developed in a study that explores the production of Gender during the controversy over  Gender theory,  on Twitter. The method articulates semiotics and computer science to further our understanding of how the techno-editorial properties of this micro-blogging platform influence that production.”  The controversy emerged after the adoption in May 2013 of a law allowing same-sex marriage. It has sparked much debates, some of them linked to gender studies, whose opponents depicted as a gender theory.&#160;<a href="#fnref:22" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>In 2016, P.P. Sneha published a report  “Mapping Digital Humanities in India.”  This is the first and foremost article that attempts to define Digital Humanities (DH) in Indian context and highlights some significant current DH projects. She records that DH is in  “incipient stage”  in India <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. However, the several key events in the recent past indicate that DH in India is steadily moving from an incipient stage to a  “progressive stage.”  These events include the recent launch of Digital Humanities Alliance of India <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> , the inaugural conference of DHAI<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  and introduction of DH courses and programmes<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> . The government schemes for public institutions such as Scheme for Promotion Academic and Research Collaboration <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, Impacting Research Innovation and Technology <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and Impactful Policy Research in Social Sciences <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> include DH/DH related areas as a domain and subdomain. Besides these initiatives, we can also see the increase in the number of DH courses, conferences, workshops, and seminars<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  that are located in the India map (See Figure 1).</p>
<p>The map represents various DH activities of the few universities and colleges from the south, north, east and west parts of the country. The  “blanks”  in the map, reminds us that India is a geographically big country and houses to a large number of public and private institutions — and, by nature, DH requires sources such as funding and high-technology, that is not possible for small colleges and universities that have limited sources. However, this map illustrates the nascent stage of DH as an emerging discipline in India. Though the term DH has begun to be noticed in the academic circle in 2010 <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, the computational tradition of humanities in India goes back two decades with two important archival projects such as Project Madurai <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> a digitised collection of ancient Tamil classics and Bichitra <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, a digital variorum of Rabindranath Tagore’s works which remarked the genesis of DH in India. Together with this, the recent mainstream attention of both central and state governments on  “Digitize India”  (<a href="https://www.digitizeindia.gov.in/">https://www.digitizeindia.gov.in/</a>) and  “Digital India”  (<a href="https://www.digitalindia.gov.in/">https://www.digitalindia.gov.in/</a>) facilitate many large-scale investments in digitization, digital library, curation, and preservation. Digitize India, Delhi Archives and National Digital Library etc. are key projects of this digital establishment. One of the primary objectives of these projects is to make digital content available to the wider public, researchers and academics. These kinds of digital initiatives open up a new horizon in the landscape of humanities to engage in DH research practice by harnessing digital tools and techniques. Nevertheless, there has been little attention and investment in deploying these digital contents for advanced scholarly practice which entails robust infrastructure.</p>

<p>The lack of engagement in integrating humanities and digital lead to many challenges in infrastructure which impedes leveraging computational resources and techniques for DH research practice in India. Hence, the questions we ask: what are the specific challenges of infrastructure? and how do that affect DH research practice in India? We endeavor to answer these questions along with a case study which includes a brief survey and a few interviews<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  conducted for our paper from academic and non-academic organizations, and individual DH scholars respectively DHAI and CIS, DH group at IIT Gandhinagar and few individual scholars and faculties in various universities from different parts of India. For the survey, we shared our questions with 55 DH scholars and faculties from 25 academic institutions including public and private universities from different parts of the country. The responses were relatively low, and we have received 17 responses to the survey (See Appendix 1). This paper aims to detail both the challenges and opportunities of the institutionalization of the Indian DH community. In the following sections, we will examine the critical issues and challenges in infrastructure such as the lack of physical space, DH pedagogy, digital tools and software, institution and government and support which hinder DH research practice in India. We will also discuss the interviews and survey report to substantiate our arguments and finally, we will present the conclusion of this article.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-in-infrastructure">The Challenges in Infrastructure</h2>
<p>What is infrastructure? Infrastructure provides more effective technical systems and services, for instance, from road to electricity, train, telephone and Internet and so on. The characteristics of infrastructure are to enable, facilitate, organize, support and manage any given system <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Such infrastructure is the backbone of any organization. It is also apposite to the infrastructure of DH. Many scholars have been discussed the term infrastructure for DH (e.g. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. There are few terms such as real infrastructure, research infrastructure, academic infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure are used to refer to the necessities of DH structure. These terms employed to discuss various components which include from digital libraries to digital artefact, data organization, digital tools, publication, digital pedagogy, digital literacy, data management etc. In his book  <em>Big Digital Imagining: a Meeting Place for the Humanities and the Digital Humanities</em> , Patrik Svensson discourses the various components of humanities and digital humanities infrastructure which he draws from his experience in various DH projects as a director of HUMlab Umeå University. He says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not possible to imagine digital humanities — or any kind of humanities — without infrastructure. However, most of the humanities may not think of itself in terms of infrastructure, and the digital humanities must engage with infrastructure not just where doing so may come most naturally, such as language technology and archaeology, but wherever there is a need. Engagement is required not just in terms of building and using infrastructure but also in terms of conceptualizing and critiquing infrastructure.<br>
<sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His observation on the concept and critique of building the infrastructure for DH is applicable to the Indian context. In India, as we have seen in the introduction, the rise in the digital initiatives is an impetus for Indian DH scholars to engage in knowledge practices and take part in the global context. Nonetheless, the local exigencies of  “conceptualizing and critiquing infrastructure”  of humanities encumber digital research practices <sup id="fnref2:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. For instance, if a scholar is interested in analyzing the data from the open-access archive through computational methods, he/she requires digital tools and software, training and finally a platform for publishing his/her outcome. Or if a scholar is interested in digitizing and archiving some historical document online, he/she requires a workspace (DH lab), computational skills, digital machine for scanning the documents, knowledge in organizing the data etc. In some cases, if DH scholar collaborates with a computer specialist for an archival project — he/she requires the basic knowledge of how the interfaces of digital intricacies work in the archive and how to maintain the archive for its sustainability. These paradigms demonstrate that  “[i]nfrastructural systems are not and have never been one thing”  and the multifaceted infrastructures are indispensable for a holistic approach to digital research practices <sup id="fnref3:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. It also conveys how the material and non-material infrastructures shape the outcome and how the deficiency in one will affect the other one.</p>
<p>DH scholars, in general, should have facilities of various components such as DH lab, digital infrastructure, digital pedagogy, funding and institutional support. The below chart illustrates such kind of a global perceptive of components that build DH infrastructure which creates a conducive DH research environment for scholars (See Figure 2). In this paper, we will argue how the dearth of these facilities affects the establishment of DH in the Indian humanities spectrum.</p>

<h2 id="dh-lab">DH Lab</h2>
<p>The nature of  “laboratory”  as a physical infrastructure of science that usually comprises of various resources of machines, devices, instruments, tools; several activities which include training, research, service; practices such as collaboration and team work-based; methods of experiment, prototyping and tinkering. DH labs  “rely on the same general principles as laboratories in the sciences, including collaborative work, practice-based and tool-based research, and an emphasis on practicality and innovation”   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. DH lab hence is a place for heterogeneous activities as scholars deploy multiple technologies ranging from programming languages to 3D printing, photogrammetry, digital tools and software to create a new content or to find or to study text or map or archive or images and so on. Such kind of DH environment is minimal, or in other words, non-existent in many Indian universities. A few DH avenues such as Centre for Digital Humanities at Institute of Advanced Studies in English <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, The Digital Humanities at Presidency University <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> and a few research groups such as Digital Humanities and Publishing Studies at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Indore <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, Digital Humanities at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>, Digital Humanities and Cultural Informatics at Jadavpur University <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> and Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> to a certain extent are equipped with digital technologies such as high performing computing, access to various digital databases, workspaces, access to a few digital tools, software and machine, training etc. Unfortunately, other public institutions and universities, where we can locate some DH research practices of text mining, digital archive, GIS, Social Network Analysis and more, lack the basic infrastructures as the  “existing institutional infrastructure is often inadequate, and mostly outdated”   <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During our survey, some of the respondents mentioned about the lack of a physical space and bureaucracy constraints which inhibit their DH research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A physical space or a lab space is important. We need both human resources as well as softwares to sustain DH at our institutes. It is difficult to acquire a space and explain the space and its need to people [T]here are a number of official formalities which one has to do for using a lab or to start some new works in the University</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, there are a few scholars, who are interested in deploying digital technologies for their research, scattered in various state and public universities such as Jawaharlal Nehru University, Bharathiar University, St. Xavier’s College, Victoria College etc. In these institutions, the absence of a number of DH scholars deters the development of the DH research group that would have led to push the bureaucracy in building their own DH space. Though these isolated individual scholars assimilate their computational skills and heuristics for their research through online resources, how do they collaborate or discuss their research with their peer groups? how do they access or use digital tools without much technical support and training? DH center and lab hence,  “play key isolation reduction role by providing technology; expertise; information about tools, standards, and ongoing projects; as well as introductions to prominent figures in the digital humanities community who can serve as guides and mentors”   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We asked in our survey whether the participants have DH center/ lab/research group at their institutions. Very few responded that they have DH lab (12%) and research group (23%). Most of them (65%) wrote that they have neither lab/center nor research group (see Figure 3). Then, we asked about the challenges in building the DH space in their institutes. Not surprisingly, the majority of the participants (55%) responded that money and other resources (human and technological resources) are the primary challenges in setting up the DH environment in their institute. 27% respondents stated that the lack of research scholars and 18% said the lack of infrastructure (see Figure 4). Besides the dearth of money, infrastructure and research scholars, there are other overarching components such as the inadequacy of DH programmes, courses and course materials, experts and training that prevent building DH center/lab in the public institutions. These human and non-human sources are fundamental to produce mass DH scholars who will later then develop DH centers, labs and DH scholarship by seeking institutions’ support and funds.</p>
<h2 id="digital-humanities-pedagogy">Digital Humanities Pedagogy</h2>
<p>The few universities and colleges such as Jadavpur University, Koti Women’s College, Srishti Institute of Arts and Design and Technology offer Post Graduate diploma, Bachelor and Master-level programmes in DH. Other pioneer institutions such as Presidency University, Bharathiar University, IIT Gandhinagar, IIT Delhi, FLAME University, Delhi University and Aligarh Muslim University offer courses on DH. DHPSR at IIT Indore is exploring  “initating a dual MS (Research) + PhD programme in Digital Humanities which is still in the works and hopefully will commence soon”  and IIT Jodhpur recently  “has plunged headlong and instituted a full-fledged PhD programme in Digital Humanities”   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. These initiatives of premier institutions offer the hope for establishing DH in India.</p>
<p>We conducted a survey of more than 50 public university programmes and their curricula for one of our upcoming essays <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. We found that DH as a programme and course is few (which are from the above-mentioned institutions) but some cross programmes aligned with  <em>Computer Science</em>  such as History-Economics-Computer Application and History-Political Science-Computers Application etc. are more in number. Computer Application as an  “appendix”  of various disciplines implies that the investment in leveraging computer knowledge system for the disciplines of humanities to ensure the employment opportunities in the digital era and to meet the global demand. Given this discourse of humanities programmes, the  “Vision 2020”  report by the Planning Committee embraces the plan to deploy Information Technology (IT) to improve the sectors of  “employment, education, infrastructure and governance”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. Subsequently, several other government initiatives such as National Mission in Education and Information and Communication Technologies (NMEICT), National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER), National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) and National Knowledge Network (NKN) reinforce the access of higher education to the  “last-mile”  through the digital infrastructure such as distance education, video lectures, virtual academy and leveraging ICT for teaching and learning processes <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. As a consequence of these digital enterprises, Humanities and Social Sciences have experienced impressive growth over the past several years in terms of its integration with digital technologies for accessing, learning and teaching. For instance, NPTEL provides 38 online courses for Humanities and Social sciences which are taught by IIT professors <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> Also, the digital repository and digital library respectively Shodhganga and National Digital Library (NDL) offer resources for the scholarly community through open access system. However, the humanities-based critical inquiry through deploying digital tools, software, methodologies and theories and incorporating learning goals which  “focus on intermediate-to-advanced integration of methodologies-such as text encoding analysis and topic modeling, data visualization, and geospatial analysis”   <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> and so on is absent in the curricula of the academic universities (except in few institutions as mentioned above). While there is an evidence of engagement with digital technologies for higher education and digital pedagogy, it is often unaware and unwilling to extend that in the critical realm of inquiry and investigation of humanities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we had the opportunity to meet a few humanities faculties, during various workshops and conferences<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  pertained to DH, have manifested a particular interest in teaching digital tools and techniques to enrich the learning process and educate future DH scholars. It depicts the significant interest among the faculties and scholars towards DH in India. Nonetheless, DH faculties Saleem Mir at the Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi and Sharmistha Chatterjee at the University of Calcutta and Arnapurna Rath at IIT Gandhinagar bring our attention to the different problems such as logistic constraints, no academia training, insufficient course materials, fast changing digital tools, lack of access to digital tools and software, lack of teamwork and more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mir: It was in 2013 that we, here at CIC, realised the importance of the field of DH. So one paper  “An Introduction to DH”  was introduced at UG level while a degree course  “M.A. in Digital Humanities and Culture Studies”  was proposed. This master&rsquo;s programme is already passed by the University of Delhi but due to logistic and infrastructural constraints this course has not yet materialised&hellip;Teaching DH has been a challenge for me as I don&rsquo;t have any formal education/training in it. But students’ response has been very encouraging and they like the practical part of the course where they are exposed to some open source softwares like voyant, QGIS, Gephi, Ngram and some other text analytics tools. The theoretical debates also generate a lot of interest amongst our students. But the problems that students as well as teachers face in the course are mainly related to the availability of course material and fast changing digital tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Chatterjee: In the absence of a properly planned module, its difficult for the students to grasp the basics of DH and how the study benefits research on Arts, Heritage and Culture. Having no infrastructure it becomes tough to demonstrate the softwares and their specific usages that restrict the study only to the theoretical level rather than practical applications. I believe every University and Department should have an introductory course on DH, if not a specific module&hellip;The other constraint is getting trained professionals in the team for planning and execution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rath: It is difficult for students to orient themselves to the digital studies as a new area of research. The other aspects is that when comes to technological support, for example the data visualization tools on mapping are not always accessible and also people are not completely aware of digital tools. We can guide students to identifying their research data and offer research ideas but when comes to realizing in the form of concrete project of website within the institute there might be a bit of a challenge in terms of handling these tools and data — we do check external support to host our projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we can observe from their interviews is that the insufficient infrastructure, as mentioned above, precludes the application of digital tools and software for scholarly practice. As Mir mentions, students can learn some open source tools, which do not require much programming skills and apply for their work. But, in some cases such as the critical inquiry of the text through an algorithm or developing digital archive, they seek help from the external support as Rath mentioned above. However, this is not possible for all other state and central university faculties/scholars as they do not have the facilities of funding, services and support for their research from their departments and institutions.</p>
<p>Another important concern is the lack of technical proficiency of current DH scholars who directly come from the traditional humanities. In the inaugural conference of DHAI, the panels presented diverse DH projects such as digital infrastructure, pedagogy, scholarly publishing, and archive etc. but just very few presentations on the digital tool and text mining. Does this mean that the current Indian DH scholars are disinterested in text mining? Nothing could be further from the truth, this comes not from disinterestedness but the lack of technical proficiency. These scholars come from traditional humanities with little education on computer applications but very much interested in employing digital technologies and heuristics for their innovative digital research. This gives  “a little confidence or inclination to understand the impact of the digital on the ways in which their projects can be influenced, indeed cannot otherwise be imagined”   <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what is frustrating and exhausting for the current DH scholars and faculties are that they can find very rare platforms for learning digital tools and technologies for their research in country like India which  “supplies millions of software engineers to the world”   <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. At the same time, not all humanities scholars and faculties have fund to attend winter and summer schools, workshops on DH which often occur in the west, for instance, DHSI (<a href="http://www.dhsi.org/">http://www.dhsi.org/</a>) etc. In India, a few DH avenues conduct various workshops and winter school on digital tools. The DHPSR group at IIT Indore conducted one-week workshop on  “Digital Humanities: Tools, Texts, Theories”  in which R and some online tools such as Voyant were taught <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. Similarly, CDH Pune conducts winter school on DH every year since 2015 and in the recent workshop which provided training in using Omeka tool for content development <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. These platforms offer some opportunities to DH scholars and faculties to learn tools and methods for their research. Additionally, self-paced learning becomes very common in the digital era due to the open access system — some scholars, who are active on the Internet, learn many open DH resources of tools and techniques<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> . However, the knowledge in data management and data organization is also equally important as one participant wrote in the survey as  “setting up a research method garnered to mining and categorising digital data has been a challenge.”  Correspondingly, during our interviews, some scholars expressed the challenge of  “know-how” ” of digital tools and software. Few scholars even end up giving their digital research practice after many attempts due to lack technical competency.</p>
<p>Research scholar Sagorika Singha at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realised the usefulness of network analysis tools and SM (Social Media) analytics while working on social media participation. While theoretical engagement and close readings were invariably important, dealing with large data-sets, such tools seemed invaluable. But unfortunately, because of the lack of know-how and this realisation coming in slightly late in the duration of the project, I could not do what I wanted to. But I am open to develop this later, whenever I find myself prepared.<br>
Research Scholar Mohanapriya at Bhararhiar University, Coimbatore:<br>
In my case, I had a bitter experience. I struggled more often to acquire this technical skill. Due to the lack of technical assistance I engaged more on YouTube channels and textbooks to learn text mining in Python. I got very few technical supports and very less contact with people who have some knowledge about this area of research. Lack of infrastructure and proper training in this programming language made me give up after facing many attempts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To overcome this issue of data organization, data management and digital literacy, the curriculum of humanities students has to implement the DH pedagogy and training at graduation level which will give the confidence to the scholars to understand the intricacy behind digital technologies and data harvesting and to implement it in their research practices. Dibyadyuti Roy is one of the co-founders of DHARTI who tells us about the DHARTI’s contribution on DH in India:  “I would personally like to see the DH curriculum permeate not only into universities but schools and vocational institutes as well. Organizing free-to-attend workshops that allow DH to become accessible for all kinds of audiences would be one goal that I would see for DHARTI.”  As he says, such local initiatives of free-to-attend or nominal fee workshops, summer and winter schools will be helpful for the current research scholars to improve their technical proficiency. Notwithstanding, the inaccessibility and unavailability of digital tools and software are also significant obstacles that remain unaddressed.</p>
<h2 id="digital-tools-and-software">Digital tools and software</h2>
<p>DH conceives text as data — although the concept of data comes from  “scientific fields such as mathematics, economics, biology, physics, and computer science… [, it] gained a central place in the humanities only with the migration of texts to the web”   <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Digital technologies have a crucial role to archive/analyze/map such kind of data/text in DH. However, for Indian DH scholars, many constraints from the local limit the possibilities of the desired outcome to archive or analyze the data. The deficit in digital technologies for Indian languages is one such limiting factor which affects digital research in Indian languages and literatures as Murray and Hand observe,  “humanities work in Indic languages has been impeded by the lack of optimized [optimal] character recognition software”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. There are a few government initiatives such as Technology Development in Indian Languages <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> and Centre for Development of Advanced Computing <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>; both attempt to facilitate the basic digital technologies such as  “[w]ord Processing, Presentation preparation, Spread Sheets preparation, Web Page Surfing &amp; Designing, Messaging etc.”  in few Indian languages for public use and scholarly activity <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. Nevertheless, these digital technologies are inadequate for the DH scholars whose research focus on the works in Indian languages. Prashant Bhattacharji, in his article  “Computer Science in India: A restricted student pool?” , quotes Microsoft’s CTO, Craig Mundie’s remark on Indian Computer Engineers as  “[they] are more into theory, [t]here is no local software and no new applications”  in Indian languages <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. As he says, the dearth of digital tools and software in Indian languages is a major limitation that is specific issue of the Global South <sup id="fnref1:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. The main issue stems from the disciplinary divide of humanities and computer science. Even though some traditional humanities scholars use digital archives and databases, they perceive employing computing for humanities research as more critical and pose epistemological skepticism in the concept of technology and text as data. Furthermore, the inadequacy of fund and the lack of institutional service and support thwart humanities scholar to have access to the payable digital technologies, and competence assistance for the existing free digital tools and software.</p>
<h2 id="institution-and-government-support">Institution and Government Support</h2>
<p>Institutional support, such grants, scholarships, services and support for research, is a key factor to drive local DH research and training. Unfortunately, it is difficult and more challenging to obtain fund and support from the institutes for advancing humanities research in India. When the DH scholars require resources for their research which are similar to the science counterpart such a demand or request is viewed with skepticism by both bureaucracy and departmental administration. In traditional humanities, the idea of DH is still perceived with skepticism. Scholars such as Stanley Fish and Timothy Brennan have also argued that DH becomes applied cousin of foundational humanities <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. Administrations in most universities are not able to comprehend the seemingly contradictory term  “Digital Humanities.”  It is easier in autonomous institutions such as IITs and elite private universities than in state or central universities that are already constrained in funding resources. In 2009, Shreesh Chaudhary in an article,  “India: Science and technology vs the humanities”  points out the huge funding difference between science and technological institutions (STIs) and humanities and social sciences institutions (HSTs). He says that science and technology institutes are funded by ministries of science and technology, defence, IT and industry. They receive some US$20 million a year for routine expenses, plus millions more from foreign agencies, non-government organizations, foreign governments and international bodies, as well as alumni donations for non-routine expenses <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. He says,  “the HSIs receive only crumbs. …While finance is not a problem for the STIs, it is a big problem for the others…The HSIs are starved of funds. They cannot provide even a minimal standard working environment for their academics and neither can they for their students.”   <sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Similarly, in their article  “Money for Nothing: The Disconcerting Future of the Humanities in India”  published in 2018, Ishani Pant and Kirti Dass say,  “At one end of the academic spectrum, science-related research endeavors are receiving funds galore; the situation is not quite as rosy at the other end. Humanities scholars in India are unable to catch a break. India is undergoing an academic crisis that threatens researchers of the humanities”   <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. Though these articles were published at different period of time; they all emphasize the same issues that humanities and social sciences in India are  “always already”  in crisis. In a similar vein, the humanities in Anglo-American countries have been encountering crisis since 1980s in many ways such as budgetary cuts, corporation model or profit model of education, falling enrollments, adjunct faculty system and so on <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. The disproportionation in the funding between science and humanities seem common in many countries. Frank Donoghue points out the unequal outside funding for American colleges and universities as,  “almost all of the federal resources [that] is dedicated to research in the sciences and engineering, the humanities has suffered everywhere”   <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. In Britain, if the humanists are unable to show their contribution to economic profitability — their fund will drop and the number of faculties and students also will decline <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. On the other hand, in India, the allocation of fund for humanities especially for research activities is meager when compared to science and technology institutes. Pant and Dass draw the disparity in the fund allocation to Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) from 2006 to 2010 — the total grant given to  “ICSSR was only 2.3% of the amount provided to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Of the funds given to ICSSR, only 20% could be used for research purposes, while the rest of the amount was utilised for meeting administrative costs, highlighting the lack of seriousness given to these subjects”   <sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The disparity in fund for humanities suggests that there must be an  “inherent issue”  in the Indian educational system. The first universities in colonial India were established to focus on conducting exams and awarding degrees and they were not designed for research practices <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. Despite the independence brought many changes in setting up various research-focused higher education institutions,  “the universities have failed to free themselves from their older legacy of having to produce more and more graduates”   <sup id="fnref1:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. On the other hand, Gangopadhyay discusses the  “educational apartheid”  which he refers to  “the glorification of science”  and  “the devaluation of studies related to humanities”  as studying science has many benefits such as  “a slew of scholarships and grants right from high school levels”  and he also points out the social pressure on good students to study science <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. Therefore, the increase number of scholarships for studying science and the social pressure to choose science over the humanities thrust the mainstream fund for research into STEM fields.</p>
<p>Such disproportion fund and educational apartheid affect the institutional service and support in terms of both human and non-human sources for DH scholars. For instance, some institutions do not even have the basic facilities such as Internet as one of the survey participants mentioned as  “[w]e don’t have access to basic facilities regularly like the Internet and all.”  Also, the completion of the project is not the end of the project — it is just the beginning for the users. For example, the scholars require institutes’ support to maintain some dynamic projects such as digital databases and archives which require human resources and digital tools to update, disseminate and maintain the longevity of the data. But these projects are neglected and conceived as a digital product which requires only a digital space in the institute’s web portal. Most of these projects have remained unprocessed and stagnant on the institute’s computer. For instance, Bhasa Bibliography the database project of DHPSR group at IIT Indore was completed collaboratively by DH scholars and computer science undergraduate students. This database will  “offer access to scholarship in these [Indian] languages and literatures other than English”   <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. The humanities scholars have collected the first stage data for three Indian languages and the structure of the database was built with help computer science students. This project is going to be a crowdsource for keep updating the data from other Indian languages. We have another in-house collaborative project is Partition Archive — documenting the cultural artifacts and firsthand experience of partition migrants in Rajasthan. These small projects face some challenges in the form of who will maintain the database? How to secure funding for its sustainability?</p>
<p>At the same time, there are other substantial issues such as the inadequate knowledge in technical proficiency and lack of guidance prevent DH scholars to write project proposals which enable national and international collaboration. Lack of fund to attend international and national conferences and workshops obstruct developing contacts for collaborative projects. This absence of social interaction for DH scholars nationally and internationally precludes the establishment of DH in India. We also asked the survey participants to state the major challenges in collaborative projects, if any, within and outside their university. 47% respondents mentioned that they have collaborative projects. The significant challenges in collaboration are obtaining fund (35%) and bureaucracy concern (29%). Some participants responded that the lack of technical proficiency (18%) and project management (18%) deter the collaboration both inside and outside their campus (see Figure 5).</p>

</figure>
<p>Nevertheless, we can note a few successful collaborative major projects such as the Scottish Cemetery Project (<a href="http://scotscemeteryarchivekolkata.com/">http://scotscemeteryarchivekolkata.com/</a>) at Presidency University in collaboration with University of St. Andrews, Scotland, Two Centuries of Indian Print project (<a href="https://www.bl.uk/projects/two-centuries-of-indian-print">https://www.bl.uk/projects/two-centuries-of-indian-print</a>) by British Library, the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the Library at SOAS University of London, DIG_IN: Digital Humanities Education Initiative Finland-India. Curriculum Development and Designing an e-Learning Module is a collaborative project of University of Helsinki, Aalto University, and Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, and the recent project A Digital Narratology of Technology as Literary Actors and Artefacts of Settings in Indian English Novels at IIT Indore in collaboration with Lancaster University etc<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> .</p>
<p>Besides these institutes level projects, the government grants schemes such as IMPRINT, IMPRESS and SPARC called for project proposals in DH. In 2016, IMPRINT identified DH as a domain for preserving heritage in the country such as languages, dialects, art forms, architectural structures, social and ethnic practices <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>; however, there is no data yet regarding the number of projects sanctioned through this scheme. The aim of the recent organization SPARC is to improve the research ecosystem of Indian higher educational institutions by enabling the collaborations between Indian institutions and the best institutions in the world. In their recent call for project proposals, DH is included under the category of  “Emergent Areas of Impact”   <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. They approved 13 DH projects of the Indian institutes for funding and the projects are in collaboration with international institutes. Recently, the southern state government Kerla announced an upcoming digital university which will include a School of Digital Humanities<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> . These state and central government’s initiatives are important milestones in instituting DH in India.</p>
<p>Similarly, the private organizations such as Centre for Internet Society <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> and Sir Ratan Tata Trust<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  underpin DH initiatives in India. Sneha, programme manager of the researchers at work programme at the CIS, tells us that their direct engagement with DH in India has largely begun through the report of mapping DH published in 2016 and also their work on policy (accessibility, intellectual property rights, internet governance and so on) has informed the landscape of  “internet studies”  in India. As they also have been part of DHARTI, we asked her to share more about the contribution of CIS in the development of DH in India.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sneha: We have had the opportunity to engage with developing conversations and practices around DH, and related areas such as GLAM and digital pedagogies. Some examples include a project with the National Audio-Visual Cultural Archive (IGNCA) on IPR and digitization best practices, contribution to Indian and international publications and conversations with organisations (academic and others) on questions of access, infrastructures, language etc. We have been part of efforts in initiating and formalizing the Digital Humanities Alliance of India and continue to support its work in bringing together researchers and practitioners interested in DH, and in outlining areas for further collaboration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these key events and bodies hopefully demonstrate the optimistic vision of DH in India. Nonetheless, there has been the dearth of investment in humanities department from both government and institutions in terms of advancing local necessities and implementing innovative things such as assemblage of technologies, workspace, DH pedagogy and scholarship, scholarly publishing platform, grant to attend conferences and services and support for DH research. These significant deficiencies impede DH studies/research in Indian academic sphere. However, DH scholars in India typically resolve some of the problems such as DH methods and some technical assistance by seeking help from outside their campus. Also, they are eager to collaborate with other institutions to conduct DH workshop etc. as one of the participants stated below. For these scholars,  “[n]ot all experiments succeed as originally imagined”  but they recognize  “the value of failure in the pursuit of innovation”   <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e have been seeking out people, workshop and conferences to widen our own knowledge base. Besides our faculty is supportive and curious about the research opportunities that DH can bring into our kind of work. We have been thinking about collaborations with outside institutions to organise workshop so that this can work as an introduction of what DH is.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All of these above including our discussion, interviews and surveys with various stakeholders of DH in India lead us to some of the following conclusions. DH as an interdisciplinary field of research practice is  <em>invisible/hidden</em>  under the rubric of humanities but it continuous to be  <em>visible/site</em>  through the research practices and projects of these DH scholars and faculties in many private and public universities. The gradual increase in courses, conferences and workshops gives us a scope of DH in India as an emerging field and we can anticipate many interesting programmes and projects in future. That is good news. The bad news is that our university ecosystem and administrative mechanism are slow to respond to these intellectual and infrastructure challenges. It, therefore, behooves all of us who are invested in pushing the boundaries of research pedagogy and learning in the humanities to emphasize and facilitate the supporting role of DH within the larger rubric of humanities. Those efforts may open avenues for critical inquiry to continue to fulfill our mandate as humanities scholars and researchers in a democratic nation state.</p>

<p>Although working in the same university and being interested in similar issues, we, the editors of this special issue, had never met until recently. As it often goes, sitting in different buildings belonging to different departments at the Otaniemi campus of the Aalto University, we were separated by the physical space and organizational structures of the university. Only the lucky coincidence that one of us had a short presentation at the  “Aalto HELDIG DH pizza”  event, and the other came to listen to that talk took us to the same room to talk to each other. Meeting on the same physical premises enabled us to see how close our interests and thoughts were, not only regarding pizza, but also in scholarly terms.</p>
<p>Our story is not unique. Exploring the digital humanities (DH) matters, one cannot avoid noticing how the establishment of various DH places and their organizational changes influences how, where, and with whom we do DH research. Place plays a role in all academic disciplines, affecting the way we construct knowledge. In the DH field, which comes with a promise of utilization of  “nonmaterial”  and ubiquitous digital resources, there is a threat that we will forget how the place is also entangled in the digital. DH scholars work together in a physical place — a center and a laboratory — in which an infrastructure, facilities, and equipment determine the knowledge creation practices. DH researchers also collaborate in virtual space — online platforms and virtual research environments — in which an infrastructure, connection, and operation affect the work and research communication. The algorithms and designs of digital analysis and collaboration tools direct the way we work and what kinds of practices are not doable. Further, DH scholars also practice and collaborate in temporary places like hackathons and summer schools established around particular topics and people. Temporariness is one aspect that forms knowledge creation practices. In addition, the prerequisites for doing DH research vary greatly based on the wider social and cultural surroundings.</p>
<p>Examination of the research practices and structures in their cultural contexts and the temporal dimensions guiding the DH from the perspective of situatedness is a relevant topic with great intellectual importance. It reveals the fundamental prerequisites and unnamed assumptions directing and influencing the research and, through that, the research findings. Although the concept of digital comes with an assumption of placelessness and detachment from geography or physical spaces, these matters still play a significant role in the way DH research is practiced today and in the future. Geography, location, and organizational structures open the questions of accessibility and equality: spatiality shapes the opportunities for doing DH research, and both divides and unifies scholars. Organizational and algorithmic structures are political because they construct the prerequisites of research by pushing toward one kind of collaboration and make other kinds of DH work difficult to pursue. The approach of looking at DH from spatial angles provides interesting views of the field’s present-day situation and where it is potentially going in the future. Therefore, it is particularly important to look at DH as a field entangled with the concepts of  <em>place</em>  and  <em>space</em>  that entail issues of the workplace, social interactions, and research communication.</p>
<p>Notions of  <em>place</em>  and  <em>space</em>  have popped up across various academic fields and been investigated in different contexts from socially constructed physical places to virtual spaces involving geospatial technologies, platforms, and services. Significantly, the development of spatial technologies and digital research, which would seem to detach work from a physical location, has led to the growing interest in the concepts of  <em>place</em>  and  <em>space</em>  that are key elements in defining the research culture. Based on essential studies on place and space by Relph [<a href="#relph1976">1976</a>], Lefebvre [<a href="#lefebvre1991">1991</a>], Soja [<a href="#soja1996">1996</a>], and Harrison and Dourish [<a href="#harrison1996">1996</a>], we identify place as a physical location that involves structure, materiality, connectedness, interaction, cultural representation, and social behavior. In contrast to place as the reality, space is seen as the physical and social landscape that emerges through processes operating over varying spatial and temporal scales <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Space is thus considered in nonphysical categories including cyberspace, digital infrastructure, geographical space, digital platforms and software. Therefore, space, as Harrison and Dourish aptly summarized, is the opportunity to build a place framed as the understood reality.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of these two concepts is a starting point to investigate  <strong>digital humanities research practices</strong>  determined by the aspects of infrastructure (material and nonmaterial), social interaction (communication and collaboration), and context (regional, social, and cultural). Our perspective on DH research practices stems from the observation of three significant changes in the field’s development, entangled with physical and virtual dimensions: institutionalization, globalization, and collaboration.</p>
<p>The first challenges are related to the  <strong>institutionalization</strong>  of DH, infrastructural transformations, and the location of DH activities at the university campus. Over the recent years, DH has been rapidly developing, moving from a  “set of practices”  toward an independent field <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> through the establishment of DH centers <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and laboratories. Some research centers have been converted into departments offering a number of different programs at the postgraduate level (e.g., the Centre for Computing in the Humanities was renamed the King’s College Department of Digital Humanities in 2011), while some have launched separate laboratories like King’s Digital Lab, formed as an independent unit in 2015 and closely affiliated with the Department of Digital Humanities at King’s College London. Thus, DH, in a certain sense, has been transformed from practice  <em>space</em>  to a physical  <em>place</em>  operating as center, department, and laboratory.</p>
<p>The function of the infrastructural turn that has occurred in the DH area is to be an  “agent of change,”  as Neil Fraistat rightly called it in the context of the DH center <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The growing number of humanities labs thus raises the questions of the role of new physical places in the humanities and new research practices formed by a laboratory structure. In contrast to early versions of DH places, the laboratory model can function both as a physical working place (e.g., the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory at Yale University Library) and a virtual research environment (e.g., HuNI — Humanities Networked Infrastructure — a virtual laboratory of the Australian government’s NeCTAR — National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Resources — program). This multifunctionality of laboratories affects DH, which is seen as both a discipline located in a physical place (center, department, and lab) and a set of practices used in various areas (virtual labs, lab courses, and collaboratories).</p>
<p>The topics of infrastructural changes and the  “laboratorization”  of the humanities have been gradually undertaken by researchers in academic <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> and nonacademic publications <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Furthermore, it is worth noting conferences and workshops devoted to institutional transformations in the humanities, such as  “Building the Humanities Lab: Scholarly Practices in Virtual Research Environments,”  the panel session in the Digital Humanities Conference held at King’s College London in 2010; the  “Theories and Practices of the Literary Lab”  roundtable at the Modern Language Association National Meeting in Boston in 2013;  “The Hum Lab: A Consortial Workshop”  organized by the Hurford Center for the Arts and Humanities at Haverford College in 2014;  “The Humanities Laboratory: Discussions of New Campus Models”  conference organized by Arizona State University’s Institute for Humanities Research at the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2016;  “Digital Humanities Forum: Places, Spaces, Sites: Mapping Critical Intersections in Digital Humanities,”  which took place at the Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Kansas in 2016;  “Reimagining the Humanities Lab,”  the panel discussion at the ADHO Conference in 2018;  “Making Change through the Humanities: Institutes, Ideas and Infrastructures”  workshop at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm in 2018;  “What Is a Feminist Lab?”  symposium at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 2019;  “Humanities Laboratories: Critical Infrastructures and Knowledge Experiments”  workshop at King’s College London in 2019;  “Rebuilding Laboratories”  workshop at the Institute of Advanced Studies of the University of Birmingham in 2019, and  “The Architecture of Science and the Humanities”  workshop held at Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in 2019. These activities show that the issues of place and space for DH research practices are becoming more and more significant in the face of DH’s institutional changes and the emergence of new research environments like virtual labs. Physical and virtual spaces entail particular research practices, the form of collaboration, and the manner of knowledge production.</p>
<p>The second noticeable change in the DH area is a turn toward internationalization and the  <strong>global development</strong>  of the field. DH has been established all over the world through research centers <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> and laboratories, increasingly extending beyond Western countries. The issue of global DH is garnering more attention, and it suffices to mention the annual international conference of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) with the special theme of Global Digital Humanities held at the University of Western Sydney in 2015, the annual Global Digital Humanities Symposium held at Michigan State University since 2016, the Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH) Special Interest Group at the ADHO, and the call for papers for a book entitled  <em>Global Debates in the Digital Humanities</em>   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, a part of the Debates in the Digital Humanities Series published by the University of Minnesota Press. The process of DH globalization involves a number of research inquiries entangled with the concepts of place and space such as global DH infrastructure, global virtual collaboration and networks, and a local physical place immersed in the regional, social, and cultural environment. DH research practices are thus both globalized and determined by the local situatedness.</p>
<p>The last observation that drives us to study the DH research practices related to the concepts of space is the creation of new forms of  <strong>collaboration and communication</strong>  through platforms (Slack, Zoom, Github, Trello, or Google Drive), social media (Twitter), and virtual research environments (TextGridLab). These tools have given rise to the development of a new model of cooperation and dissemination of research, taking place in physical and virtual environments (e.g.  “Making Connections”  was the first Humanities Commons Twitter conference in 2019). The collaboration processes have both spatial and temporal dimensions; therefore, we suggest examining research practices occurring in temporary events, the durability of established collaboration, the opportunity for creating global collaboration, and the research ethics related to virtual cooperation, and more. The various digital research tools that DH scholars use and develop can be seen as spaces requiring a certain type of data organization, working methods, language skills, and cultural understanding to function properly. Simultaneously, particularly those analysis programs that are easy to use or that facilitate easy learning can become widely used only because of the access and not necessarily because of the high-quality analysis.</p>
<p>The above changes and observations, related to the concepts of  <em>place</em>  and  <em>space</em> , present the  <strong>digital humanities research as situated practices</strong> . The development of infrastructure in the humanities and the establishment of laboratory places have led to the transformation of the humanities toward a situated field <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> entangled with physical and virtual environments. The research process occurring in a particular place becomes as significant as the outcome of a study. A laboratory draws attention to the place where work is constructed, focusing on research practices, structures, devices, and workplace design. The shift toward situated practices is the vital context for the investigation of place in DH since it opens up the discussion on the issue of research practices in a specific environment, employing tools and materials in space, design space, research collaboration, and the spatial representation of practice. Hence, contributors to this special issue discuss different forms of situatedness: institutional, local, regional, national, geographical, socio-cultural, and virtual.</p>
<p>As more scholars become engaged with DH research all over the world, and the organizational structures of the sites of digital humanities is developing fast, we need to look at the concepts of  <em>place</em>  and  <em>space</em>  that significantly affect the research culture. Therefore, this special issue brings these scattered discussions together and examines the situatedness of DH research practices in wider terms.</p>
<h2 id="situated-research-practices-in-digital-humanities">Situated Research Practices in Digital Humanities</h2>
<p>The articles in this special issue examine the different aspects of the  <strong>situated research practices</strong>  of the DH, covering two perspectives, respectively referring to the title of  <em>Lab and Slack</em> : physical and virtual places of DH research. The  <strong>physical</strong>  places of research refer to the various DH laboratories and centers all over the world and more widely to the surroundings that a location in a particular city, country, or continent gives to DH research. As for the  <strong>virtual</strong>  environments of DH research, we define the digital internet-based collaboration platforms that enable research and scholarly collaboration. We propose thinking through the location-based research practices and digital collaboration forms of the DH research to explore the role of spatiality in locating the field, facilitating digital practices, changing the nature of research, and fostering collaboration. The issue explores spatial transformations and the architecture of the DH to examine how the organization of DH research, the materiality, and social practices are bound with a place where researchers interact, material devices are collected, and knowledge is constructed. It also seeks to respond to the question of how the spatiality and organization of space can prevent or complicate high-quality DH research.</p>
<p>The aspects that influence DH research in both physical and virtual places are (1) infrastructures, (2) the research and collaboration practices the places facilitate, (3) the social and cultural contexts relevant in that place, and (4) the temporality. These aspects influence one another, and changes in one can affect the others. All these aspects affect what is studied, the ways research can be done and, in the end, the results of our knowledge, what kind of knowledge DH research can provide.</p>
<p>The infrastructures (1) set, for example, the position of a lab in the university organization, its funding, collaboration premises, the material devices, and digital resources it can offer. Further, in virtual platforms, there are material infrastructures, such as the capacity of the used devices, the strength of the internet connection, and the setting conditions. In addition, in virtual platforms, the algorithmic design defines what kinds of collaboration and research practices are possible in that place, how all the used platforms communicate with one another, and how easy it is to organize the used data and identify the significant discussions as the project proceeds.</p>
<p>The research and collaboration practices (2) are less-tangible aspects of the situated DH research. Both in a laboratory setting and on a virtual collaboration platform certain research methods are favored over the others, the division of labor and collaboration is designed following a certain logic, and the meetings are structured in a certain way. The research and collaboration practices influence the ways information processing and filtering proceeds and potentially what ideas become crystallized, and which are left aside.</p>
<p>Additionally, the social and cultural context (3) plays a significant role both in the DH centers and in virtual platforms. Location of a lab in a particular city and, for example, proximity or distance to other DH institutions or the IT industry, the accessibility, quantity and quality of digital data on local issues, or legislation all influence the functions of a DH lab. The virtual collaboration platforms enable global collaboration and encounters between scholars with diverse backgrounds. To avoid misunderstandings, the communication in a virtual platform must be very explicit in the cases where there is no, or very limited, physical contact. The social and cultural context also raises the important questions of accessibility: who feels welcomed and socially accepted in a DH space and who does not, and what kinds of disciplinary backgrounds or research topics are favored over the others?</p>
<p>The temporal (4) dimension also matters: to meet people, you need to be in the right place at the right moment. Virtual collaboration is also bound to time, both in projects collaborating across time zones and in more mundane questions of the virtual collaborators’ preferred working rhythms.</p>
<p>The special issue divides the situated research practices into physical and virtual for the sake of analysis, but we acknowledge that, in reality, these aspects often overlap. Several articles in this special issue point out that the physical and digital actually overlap, and it is often practically impossible to separate them from each other [see, for example, <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000480/">El Khatib et al.</a>]. The underlying assumption of this special issue is that DH research is very much a collaborative effort. Although we acknowledge that there is also excellent DH research done by individual scholars, they are often associated with a physical or virtual DH environment and the discussions there.</p>
<p>The articles in this special issue are grouped into two main clusters that represent a unified set of themes: Cluster 1:  “Physical Situatedness, Digital/Humanities Labs, and Infrastructure”  with a subcluster  “Digital Humanities Lab: Case Studies”  and Cluster 2:  “Virtual Situatedness, Digital Practices, and Collaboration” .</p>
<h2 id="cluster-1-physical-situatedness-digitalhumanities-labs-and-infrastructure">Cluster 1: Physical Situatedness, Digital/Humanities Labs, and Infrastructure</h2>
<p>A discussion of the mutual relations between situatedness, infrastructure, and digital/humanities practices has been largely unexplored so far. We rarely think about DH in the context of physical place; however, this material aspect of work has a strong influence on the way the research is conducted and produced. A physical place involves affiliation, architecture, design, organization, policy, and equipment. It is located in a particular environment (local, regional, and national) that affects its development and operation. All these features shape the condition, possibilities, and constraints of doing scholarly works. They can both stimulate and disturb the research work and drive and limit interdisciplinarity and collaboration, as well as facilitate and hinder the transfer of knowledge. Hence, this cluster opens a number of interesting perspectives on the complexities of situated research practices. Contributors offer intellectual engagement with critical thoughts on the role of socio-material infrastructure in the humanities practices. The purpose of this section is to provide a theoretical framework for the discussion and understanding of the impact of situatedness on the production and transmission of scholarly knowledge. Authors use a wide range of theoretical tools to present various approaches to undertaking this research inquiry. The analyses lie at the intersections of infrastructure studies (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000463/">Guldi</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000466/">Pawlicka-Deger</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000468/">Kil</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000471/">Shanmugapriya and Menon</a>), critical analysis of the infrastructure design (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000463/">Guldi</a>), the archaeology of humanities infrastructure (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000468/">Kil</a>), digital humanities and science and technology studies (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000465/">Malazita, Teboul and Rafeh</a>), laboratory studies (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000465/">Malazita, Teboul and Rafeh</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000466/">Pawlicka-Deger</a>), interdisciplinary studies (see Oiva), and knowledge production and transfer (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000464/">Oiva</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000471/">Shanmugapriya and Menon</a>). This broad theoretical perspective shows how digital/humanities practices become conditioned by a university’s organizational structure, infrastructure, and digital technologies.</p>
<p>Here, the authors discuss the complexities and the agency of infrastructure, which organization and design are socially constructed and embedded within the larger culture of critical thinking about technology and culture (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000463/">Guldi</a>). The contributors argue that the infrastructure is engaged with existing thought about power, represents a form of scholarly argumentation (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000463/">Guldi</a>), and produces epistemic objects through the boundaries drawn around what makes an object knowable (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000465/">Malazita, Teboul and Rafeh</a>). They show how the infrastructure, the laboratory apparatus, the socio-material assemblages, and the virtual are in a co-constitutive relationship; they all produce one another, participating in one another’s existence (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000465/">Malazita, Teboul and Rafeh</a>). Further, the authors demonstrate how the location, design, and facilities are significant components of the infrastructure models that are differentiated by operation and function. Each model for laboratory structure entails different research practices, methods, and actions, and consequently, produces a specific knowledge (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000466/">Pawlicka-Deger</a>). The mechanisms of knowledge production and transfer are particularly dependent on the infrastructure that facilitates and shapes these processes. The authors show how DH centers enable interdisciplinary knowledge transfer, foster research practices, and maintain interdisciplinary networks (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000464/">Oiva</a>). Next, the contributors demonstrate the relationships between the physical situatedness (a location, city, and country) and the knowledge creation and dissemination. The authors present how the location in a prominent city and the proximity to other universities and DH places are essential factors in manufacturing knowledge, facilitating collaboration and driving competition (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000464/">Oiva</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000471/">Shanmugapriya and Menon</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000468/">Kil</a>). At the same time, the distance from leading institutions and the lack of infrastructure hinder research practices, the transfer of knowledge, and scholarly communication (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000471/">Shanmugapriya and Menon</a>). The authors claim that the infrastructure plays a critical role in the humanities practices, not only in the DH based on collaborative and interdisciplinary initiatives and access to digital tools and resources, but also in the  “analog humanities”  that are rarely considered in terms of infrastructure. The authors reveal that the analog files and repositories also affect the research methods and, consequently, they can influence theoretical framework and development (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000468/">Kil</a>). To summarize, contributors to the first cluster present various perspectives and theoretical tools for the discussion on the entanglement of the infrastructure and situatedness in the digital/humanities work.</p>
<p><strong>Jo Guldi</strong> ’s essay,  “Scholarly Infrastructure as Critical Argument,”  presents critical reflections on the design of infrastructure. Guldi argues that the infrastructure designers are engaging in critical argumentation with their tools, and proposes the principles of critical thinking about the infrastructure that define the  “culture of infrastructure” . The criteria show evidence of critical thinking about humanities practice and active imagination of how digital infrastructure can mirror or enhance the traditional values of the humanities — that is, transparency, replicability, and public discourse. The article draws from an autobiographical narrative of the author’s own initiative in the design and building of a piece of infrastructure called Paper Machines. Based on personal experience, the author determines a set of  “critical”  principles of infrastructure that constitute the kind of interventions that render the invisible visible and stimulates the public purposes and intellectual orientation intended in the building of infrastructure, and the extent to which humanities and social science critiques of the flow of information and power in society have resulted in the creation of alternative or transformative flows.</p>
<p><strong>Urszula Pawlicka-Deger</strong> , in the article  “The Laboratory Turn: Exploring Discourses, Landscapes, and Models of Humanities Labs,”  reflects on a laboratory boom that has occurred in the humanities area over the past years. With the multiplication and diversification of laboratories at university campuses, in city spaces, and in cultural institutions, it is essential to analyze the stimulus of the laboratories’ emergence and understand their conditions, meanings, and functions. The paper begins with the investigation of three discourses that gave rise to the formation of a laboratory in the humanities: the transformation of the humanities infrastructure within the university, the paradigm shifts in the social sciences, and the expansion of cultural categories (innovation, the maker movement, and the idea of community). Further, Pawlicka-Deger reflects on the definition of the humanities lab and presents a history of the laboratory in the humanities. Next, the author analyzes five models for humanities labs (the center-type lab, the techno-science lab, the work station-type lab, the social challenges-centric lab, and virtual lab) and shows how their situatedness, structure, and function entail different ways of knowledge production. The essay indicates the role of digital humanities as the driving force behind building a laboratory space, which promotes a culture of experimentation and collaboration. The author shows that the humanities lab does not imitate the science lab but adapts this new infrastructure for its own purposes and needs.</p>
<p><strong>James W. Malazita, Ezra J. Teboul, and Hined Rafeh</strong> ’s article  “Digital Humanities as Epistemic Cultures: How DH Labs Make Knowledge, Objects, and Subjects”  examines a DH lab from the perspective of science and technology studies and laboratory studies. The central thesis of this essay is that the concept of the  “situatedness”  of DH labs extends beyond physical/institutional space and also includes epistemic, political, sociological, and disciplinary issues. The authors outline the constructivist model of laboratory knowledge practices developed through feminist laboratory studies, and how that model’s focus on the laboratory as a producer of research subjects, rather than a container for them, runs counter to narratives about laboratories in DH. The authors argue for the construction of DH laboratories as epistemic cultures that produce epistemic objects and subjects — objects of inquiry and the practitioners who study those objects — as well as provide the conditions and infrastructures that make legitimate DH research. The analysis is based on a case study of the Tactical Humanities Lab at Rensselaer, an innovative DH lab established in a seemingly nonhumanities environment that is Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The essay thus presents the DH lab situated within the area of science and technology studies and addresses the issues of its identity, location, and the social construction of laboratory work boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Mila Oiva</strong>  in her article  “The Chili and Honey of Digital Humanities Research”  examines DH centers from the perspective of an interdisciplinary knowledge transfer, which she argues as being one of the core elements of DH research. Based on interviews of the directors, researchers, and administrators of established DH centers, she explores how these DH professionals describe the facilitation of interdisciplinary knowledge transfer in DH centers. The article discusses the way knowledge transfer facilitates and influences the knowledge production in the field. The article points out that the transfer of knowledge in DH centers is based on overlapping layers of organic networks and stable organizational structures that support various kinds of knowledge-sharing practices. Knowledge transfer in DH centers combines an exchange of ideas in the same place physically and online communication at various network layers, ranging from outside academia to internal communication between a research group. The factors that enable information flows also have the capability of restricting potentially meaningful information from entering to the field.</p>
<p><strong>Aleksandra Kil</strong>  in the article  “Excavating Infrastructure in the Analog Humanities’ Lab”  investigates Claude Lévi-Strauss’s  <em>Laboratoire d’anthropologie sociale</em>  as a case study of the archaeology of the humanities laboratory. The author provides an in-depth analysis of the Laboratory of Social Anthropology (LAS) established in the Collège de France in 1960, linking DH with structuralism and structural anthropology. Kil discusses the physical situatedness of the LAS, the pragmatic and entrepreneurial side of its workings, and how this lab was initially organized around its prominent research apparatus, the Human Relations Area Files, a vast pre-electronic ethnographical database produced at Yale. Kil situates the LAS in the framework of the analog humanities and in the discussion on the infrastructure in the humanities. The article thus examines the infrastructural features of the analog humanities lab, which are not recognized as easily as in the case of contemporary digital labs. Kil excavates the origins of the research infrastructure as we know it: a lab, repository, catalog, and database. Drawing on theories of media archaeology and critical infrastructure studies, the article opens new research inquiries in the scope of the archaeology of the humanities infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Shanmugapriya T. and Nirmala Menon</strong>  discuss in  “Infrastructure and Social Interaction: Situated Research Practices in Digital Humanities in India”  the present state of DH in India. The authors address the challenges related to DH infrastructure and interdisciplinary research collaboration in India by mapping the latest Indian DH hot spots in interviews and a survey. The unevenly distributed access to physical infrastructures and structural obstacles to interdisciplinary and interorganizational collaboration create challenges for DH research. The authors also demonstrate how the narrow integration of humanists and computer scientists is still a challenge. The diverging career expectations and interests of the potential collaborators, as well as the lack of technical know-how among the humanists, create obstacles in a country with  “millions of software engineers.”  Further, digital infrastructures still do not always support, for example, the computational analysis of several Indian languages. This absorbing and needed essay provides an important opportunity to advance the understanding of how geographical, cultural, and physical situatedness affect the advancement of DH. It also makes an important contribution to the field of global DH.</p>
<h2 id="digital-humanities-lab-case-studies">Digital Humanities Lab: Case Studies</h2>
<p>Building a DH space requires a proper infrastructure, facilities, institutional regulations, funding, policy, community, and many more components that direct the development strategy, form a research environment, and shape the identity of the place. These components also construct and constitute the borders of the space, which raises the questions of inclusion and exclusion and affects the way of establishing a local DH community and people’s sense of belonging to the space. Place attachment made by policy, representation, and symbolic gestures is accompanied by a negative side of place identity that is exclusion. The question is whether a DH venue creates a mechanism to exclude people from that place and, thereby, from the field. This investigation takes us back to a long-lasting discussion regarding belonging to the DH area; now, we return to this debate to pose the question about the role of place in building a sense of attachment and exclusion. Further, the DH venue is embodied in the surrounding environment, which has a strong impact on its operation, function, and practices. In light of the ongoing discussions on the locality of DH, the time is ripe to consider the conditions of establishing a site and the aspects of making a unique place reflecting the local flavor. Therefore, this cluster offers deep insight into the mechanism of creating and sustaining a DH space.</p>
<p>The articles fit squarely into the  “Building a DH Center”  genre; however, they do more than simply summarize the ways of establishing a local DH place: the contributors, who are the core and engine of the DH — scholars, practitioners, and students — share their personal experience and memories related to building and maintaining a DH place. These workpieces present absorbing stories of successes and failures, opportunities and obstacles, affections and frustrations. The authors reveal critical issues related to the sustainability of a DH place controlled by the local administrative decisions, budgetary priorities, the nature of the industry, and higher education (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000470/">Cummings, Roh and Callaway</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000473/">Berens, Gaterud and Noorda</a>). They pose crucial questions of how the place’s location and institutional affiliations can both drive and hinder interdisciplinary collaboration (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000472/">Fickers and Heijden</a>). They also disclose significant problems of accessibility and physical constraints arising from the design and size of a place (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000478/">Phillips et al.</a>). Further, the authors demonstrate how the architecture of space plays a crucial role in driving the research process, stimulating creativity and engagement, and also ensuring security and transparency (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000479/">DeRose and Leonard</a>). Hence, the authors discuss how the physical and virtual situatedness define and delimit ways of conducting research, establishing a community, and interacting with people (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000470/">Cummings, Roh and Callaway</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000478/">Phillips et al.</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000472/">Fickers and Heijden</a>). Contributors show how essential it is to shape the identity of a place that resonates with the local and regional environment (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000470/">Cummings, Roh and Callaway</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000473/">Berens, Gaterud and Noorda</a>) and how important it is to create a sense of place and a culture of connectedness for the community situated as a group in one collaborative working space (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000472/">Fickers and Heijden</a>). This cluster reveals the ongoing tensions between the vertical structure of the administrative and economic landscape of the university in which a place is situated and the horizontal structure of the community that is the place’s soul and engine. Even though DH spaces struggle with funding, facilities, and proper location, the most significant aspect is the community that fulfills a place, measures its functionality, and brings the place to life. Similarly, if a center does not engage the community and draw a critical mass of scholars and students, administrative and technological supports alone are not enough to make the place successful. The sense of belonging to the community is thus one of the key elements of creating a place, and it can ensure its sustainability, enjoyment, and success. Therefore, given the growth of DH institutions, centers, and labs, it is important that we discuss such issues now, collect experience, and provide recommendations that can guide and support the future attempts to build a DH place.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine DeRose and Peter Leonard</strong>  in the essay  “Digital Humanities on Reserve: From Reading Room to Laboratory at Yale University Library”  present the history of space in the Sterling Memorial Library of Yale University from 1931 to 2019 and its transformation along with the development of DH. The history of the newest scholarly support environments at Yale, namely the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory, renovated in 2019, dates back to 1931 when a Reserve Book Reading Room was designed in an elaborate Early English Renaissance style. The authors describe the structural, aesthetic, and programmatic transformations of a space that aimed to facilitate, drive, and mirror DH practices. The article examines the role of the design library, architecture, and policy interventions in building and fostering the DH field. The transformation of the space in Sterling Memorial Library involved new ways of thinking about location, materiality, transparency, security, and collaboration. DeRose and Leonard present the efforts of designing a suitable place for DH practices as well as the challenges of an adaptive reuse of a historic (and historicizing) space, which is undoubtedly different from the process of renovating a newer, less decorative facility or constructing a completely new room.</p>
<p><strong>Rebekah Cummings, David S. Roh, and Elizabeth Callaway</strong>  in the article  “Organic and Locally Sourced: Growing a Digital Humanities Lab with an Eye Towards Sustainability”  present a history and process of building a DH center at the University of Utah. The authors take readers back to 2009, when the first Digital Scholarship Lab was established, aiming at bringing together scholars engaged in digital scholarship practices from different parts of campus. Despite early administrative buy-in, staff enthusiasm, and technological support, the lab failed. After this unsuccessful effort, the second attempt to create a DH center was rooted in skepticism. The authors show the path of the second lab’s formation: the Digital Matters Lab launched in 2017. Based on this experience, the authors share lessons of building a DH lab, which can be summarized in three bullet points: 1) a lab is a community that should be reflected in an active, vibrant space; 2) strong relationships with a supportive administration is vital to success; and 3) the lab’s mission should be driven by local needs. The authors further examine these factors and present how the Digital Matters Lab navigates complex institutional legacies and fosters a formal center with a cross-campus partnership, mission, and identity. The article concludes by looking to the future of the Digital Matters Lab and its goals for the upcoming years, including sustainability, a regional identity, and campus integration.</p>
<p><strong>Andreas Fickers and Tim van der Heijden</strong>  reflect critically in  “Inside the Trading Zone: Thinkering in a Digital History Lab”  on the practical and epistemological challenges of doing historical research in the digital age. Their analysis is based on a case study of the Digital History Lab and its Doctoral Training Unit (DTU) on  “Digital History and Hermeneutics,”  an interdisciplinary research and training program established at the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH) of the University of Luxembourg. The article examines the DTU as an interdisciplinary trading zone that applies the method of  “thinkering”  — the term that merges the tinkering with technology with the critical reflection on the practice of doing digital history. Drawing on this case study, the essay addresses significant questions related to how interdisciplinary trading zones are being constituted in practice, and how they are situated in physical working environments. The authors investigate the role of a physical space in forming a trading zone from the perspectives of the spatial and organizational framework of the DTU, experiences of the DTU doctoral candidates, and the usage of digital methods and tools in situated digital history research. The article constitutes an important contribution to the discussion on  “interdisciplining digital humanities.”</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Phillips, Alexander Babbitt, Soohyun Cho, Jessica Kane, Cody Mejeur, and Craig Pearson</strong> ’s essay  “Creating Spaces for Interdisciplinary Research across Literature, Neuroscience, and DH”  gives a deep insight into the meaning of interdisciplinarity in practice and the building of a space for supporting cross-disciplinary works. The reflections are based on a case study of the Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition Lab (DHLC) founded at Michigan State University in 2012. The authors share their experiences, memories, and research projects on  “literary neuroscience”  lying at the intersection of DH and cognitive studies. The essay aims to reinterpret the interdisciplinarity that is not limited to the discussion of collaboration between different fields but, instead, involves a culture of  “chaotic space full of work, odd debates, and fun.”  This chaotic place is built by the people who represent divergent disciplines and positions, enjoy different kinds of music, and share common jokes. This case study shows that a laboratory is constituted by people who are ready to take a risk, spend every moment in the lab, and overcome any constraints. The authors summarize the most important lessons they learned along the way, including the importance of the lab’s nonhierarchical structure, serendipitous accidents, and the joy of working in a group. This essay presents how a lab can expand beyond experiments into a unified and unrivaled community.</p>
<p><strong>Kathi Inman Berens, Abbey Gaterud, and Rachel Noorda</strong> ’s article  “Ooligan Press: Building and Sustaining a Feminist Digital Humanities Lab at a R-2”  presents an original model for DH infrastructure that is a lab operating under market conditions. Ooligan Press is a not-for-profit book publishing lab where students of Portland State University collectively own and operate the publishing house. The history of Ooligan Press itself is an atypical example of a DH lab that became a large-scale structured entity through a set of accidental and atypical environments: backdoor founding, little funding, accidental national distribution, and curriculum integration. This atypical environment is part of what made the existence of Ooligan Press possible, what shaped its characteristics, and what makes the press difficult to replicate in a top-down DH lab model as opposed to the grassroots, bottom-up approach that led to Ooligan’s success. The authors pose significant questions, rarely discussed in the context of labs: How to connect the lab’s output holistically to the communities it serves? What’s the role of a lab in helping students achieve learning outcomes they seek when they enroll in a degree program? The essay examines the lab using the M.E.A.L.S. framework developed by Elizabeth Losh and Jacqueline Wernimont, that is, Materiality, Embodiment, Affect, Labor, and Situatedness. The authors show how overwork and passion are intertwined and how significant it is to build a community, a group of people who can work together, support one another in stressful situations, and share both the success and failure.</p>
<h2 id="cluster-2-virtual-situatedness-digital-practices-and-collaboration">Cluster 2: Virtual Situatedness, Digital Practices, and Collaboration</h2>
<p>Alongside the physical places, DH research takes place in digital collaboration and analysis platforms. As DH often involves teamwork and the usage of research  “materials”  in a digitally shareable form (data, code, visualizations), research practices are increasingly performing in a digital manner. The algorithmic choices of the research tools and collaboration platforms create architectural shapes that direct our doings in the digital spaces. We discuss at Zoom and Skype meetings, organize the workflow through Slack and Trello, share materials through Github and Dropbox, and cowrite papers in Google Drive and LaTeX. We also develop new research tools and pipelines and modify their uses to suit our purposes. Being built by humans, the digital collaboration and analysis software contain cultural and spatial structures that enable one kind of activity and constrain another. Utilization of virtual collaborative spaces sets us partially free from geographical constraints but simultaneously ties us to other kinds of spatial and cultural dimensions. To communicate effectively in a digital platform, one must learn the internal communication culture of that channel.</p>
<p>The articles in this cluster study virtual situatedness, collaboration, organizational structures and research practices from various perspectives. They address virtual situatedness by exploring how DH community structures are being shaped by the call for openness (<a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000480/">El Khatib et al.</a>) and showing how digital collaboration tools can provide spaces for building and maintaining affective networks (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000474/">Evalyn et al.</a>). Being nonphysical, digital platforms enable the easy establishment of a multitude of different kinds of  “rooms”  for different purposes. Although it is easy to start a group in Facebook, Trello, or Slack, to maintain it and make it flourish demands conscious development of research and collaboration practices (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000474/">Evalyn et al.</a>). Several articles in this cluster demonstrate that, although the architecture of digital research and collaboration tools push toward certain kinds of usage, the users themselves establish different practices and employ the tools in the ways that best support their needs (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000474/">Evalyn et al.</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000477/">Maryl et al.</a>). Virtually situated research practices are often imagined in a form of a chain of problems and solution choices. This chain can appear either in the creative usage of various tools (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000477/">Maryl et al.</a>) or by using the concept of a pipeline, with the possibility to adjust different parts of the pipeline to better fit the purposes of the study (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000481/">Lee et al.</a>).</p>
<p>Research software development is, as Bardiot and Lee et al. demonstrate, a philosophical, technological, and practical evolution process that demands deep knowledge of the domain, the ways data is usually studied, and profound argumentation on how it should be studied (see also <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000463/">Guldi</a> in Cluster 1). The ways in which the scholarly infrastructures are built not only influence the research outcomes but can also either facilitate or complicate sharing detailed information on the methods, peer review, and development of the field (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000481/">Lee et al.</a>). The articles address critical questions regarding the quick obsolescence of digital tools and collaborative spaces. DH work takes place in a constantly evolving and changing environment, as research teams fluctuate over time, and software versions continuously change (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000477/">Maryl et al.</a>). The digital spaces are constantly changing, and the chat  “room”  you entered last year might not be there today. What will happen to the conversations that store our ideas and demonstrate valuable collaborative development processes or the research outcomes stored in outdated formats within a few years (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000476/">Bardiot</a>)? How will we ensure that we will not forget the old knowledge while we are constantly running after the new?</p>
<p>Further, the articles reveal different needs of functionalities and research and communication practices in different collaborative settings. An individual researcher can conduct research by adjusting a pipeline developed by another scholar (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000481/">Lee et al.</a>), while a research lab — or a tree of labs! — hosting several intersecting research projects, must develop a multichannel exchange of ideas and emotions (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000480/">El Khatib et al.</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000474/">Evalyn et al.</a>). A research project that involves nonacademic institutions, like the analysis of performing art with the artists, requires a digital platform that allows documentation of the data when the artists create it and preserves it for the scholar for later studies (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000476/">Bardiot</a>). Digital scholarly collaboration also comes in the forms of openness, transparency, sharing protocols and pipelines, ideas for different functions in a tool, and open source and interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and methods (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000480/">El Khatib et al.</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000477/">Maryl et al.</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000481/">Lee et al.</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000476/">Bardiot</a>). The increasing amount of data sets new challenges for various fields that need to ponder their approach to vulnerable and heterogenous digital traces (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000476/">Bardiot</a>) and develop new practices of digital data use (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000477/">Maryl et al.</a>). Through conscious choices in the practices in a research community, it is possible to develop an affective and supportive digital community (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000474/">Evalyn et al.</a>), compile information in collaboration, and systematically build on previous findings and comparisons (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000480/">El Khatib et al.</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000476/">Bardiot</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000477/">Maryl et al.</a>; <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000481/">Lee et al.</a>). The ethical questions of DH are tightly woven together with research practices, for example, in building a research community and collegial support (see <a href="/dhqwords/vol/14/3/000474/">Evalyn et al.</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Randa El Khatib, Alyssa Arbuckle, Lynne Siemens, Ray Siemens and Caroline Winter</strong>  in  “An  Open Lab?  The Electronic Textual Cultures Lab in the Evolving Digital Humanities Landscape”  begin the Cluster by analyzing the overlapping physical and virtual space of the Canadian Social Knowledge Institute (C-SKI), a major institution coordinating and supporting the Electronic Textual Cultures Laboratory (ETCL), the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI), and the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) Partnership in Canada. Dwelling on the concept of  <em>open social scholarship</em>  and the assumption of a correlation between the developing knowledge landscape and the structure of an intellectual facility, the article explores the functions of the community. It shows how the community has been structured to support open social scholarship and explores what types of lab infrastructure models, tools and user practices facilitate open social scholarship. For example, a digital platform, the Canadian HSS Commons, enables connecting, collaborating and dissemination of research among academic institutions and with the broader public. The article is an important contribution to our understanding on how the structures of physical and virtual lab spaces can shape scholarly openness to the broader society.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Evalyn, C. E. M. Henderson, Julia King, Jessica Lockhart, Laura Mitchell, Suzanne Conklin Akbari</strong>  in  “One Loveheart at a Time: The Language of Emoji and the Building of Affective Community in the Digital Medieval Studies Environment”  analyze the Slack usage practices of the Old Books, New Science Lab (OBNS) at the University of Toronto. The article shows how the versatile group of faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates, and digital librarians created channels dedicated to various lab tasks and developed Slack usage practices and  “languages”  to meet their daily needs. For them, Slack is not just a collaborative tool, it serves as a platform for building and maintaining a powerful affective network that brings together the members of the community. Informal language and rich emoji usage culture — some created by the community members — play a crucial role in sustaining the affective digital community. The article addresses the wider questions of work in neoliberal academic settings and the role of the digital community in helping to cope there. The authors state that their Slack channel reflects the lab’s simultaneously horizontal collaborative nature and the vertical structures that come with working in the university settings. They identify the tension between the horizontal and vertical aspects as productive tension, which has helped them create a community that simultaneously supports both professional productivity and wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Clarisse Bardiot</strong>  describes in  “Theatre Analytics: Developing Software for Theatre Research”  the genesis and the process of developing the free and open source tools  <em>Rekall</em>  and  <em>MemoRekall</em> . Rekall is a digital environment for documenting and analyzing creative digital processes, and MemoRekall is a web-based tool that facilitates rich video annotation. The article discusses how the development process of the tools was initially launched to address research needs in the performing arts, the main objectives set for the tools at the beginning of the project, and how collaboration with various user groups helped deepen and shape the tools’ functionalities. In her article, Bardiot raises crucial questions regarding the preservation and obsolescence of digital traces and the technologies we use, and how new ways of thinking about the data and developing new digital tools can push forward, adding new analytical layers, such as  “theater analytics,”  to traditional research.</p>
<p><strong>Maciej Maryl, Costis Dallas, Jennifer Edmond, Jessie Labov, Ingrida Kelpšienė, Michelle Doran, Marta Kołodziejska, and Klaudia Grabowska</strong>  present in  “A Case Study Protocol for Meta-Research into Digital Practices in the Humanities”  a protocol for the meta-analysis of DH research, based on three pilot studies. In the pilot studies, the Digital Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities in Europe (DARIAH) and the Digital Methods and Practices Observatory (DiMPO) Working Group identified divergent uses of digital tools and a variety of research practices adjusted to the specific needs of each individual research project. The authors propose a protocol of meta-research that consists of a set of specific methodological guidelines for researchers wishing to study research practices in the humanities. The protocol aims to help the scholars produce comparable research results that will help track and understand novel research practices and assess their impact on scholarly activity. Thus, the article is a step toward establishing a systematic reflection on the implication of the combination of various digital platforms and their using practices to humanities research.</p>
<p><strong>Ashley S. Lee, Poom Chiarawongse, Jo Guldi, and Andras Zsom</strong>  in  “The Role of Critical Thinking in Humanities Infrastructure. The Pipeline Concept with a Study of HaToRI (Hansard Topic Relevance Identifier)”  propose the pipeline concept to DH research. Pipeline is a chain of algorithms that processes the selected data using subsequent steps. As each step and used algorithm is documented, usage of the pipeline allows replication of the study, conducting the similar process to another dataset and altering the used algorithms of the process to better suit one’s research. Transparency of the process enables exploring best practices in digital research, where open discussions about tools, their functions and interpretation can turn into informative examples leading to development of the methods. To illustrate how a pipeline works, the authors present the  <em>HaToRI</em>  (Hansard Topic Relevance Identifier), an open-source pipeline-based tool for identifying thematically-linked passages in the nineteenth-century debates of Britain&rsquo;s Parliament. They show how a series of algorithms move through the steps of cleaning a corpus, organizing them into topics, and selecting particular topics that are used to extract a subcorpus of interest in HaToRI. The article also gives an example of how the pipeline can be used in studying debates on property in the nineteenth-century British Parliament.</p>
<p>At this point, we would like to thank all the authors for their valuable contributions to this special issue and for their collaboration and patience. We would like to also say a big thank you to the editor-in-chief, Julia Flanders for giving us this wonderful opportunity, the journal editor, Cassandra Cloutier, and other the DHQ editors for their constant help. We also benefited a great deal from many constructive and insightful comments of anonymous reviewers. It has been a great pleasure to work with all of you.</p>

<p>In 1983, A Woman’s Coffeehouse of Minneapolis, Minnesota taped an open community meeting during which members of the predominately white, working class, lesbian coffeehouse could reflect on their experiences. One middle-aged participant remarked that by not speaking with younger generations of lesbians about differences between their coming-out experiences, she felt that  “she [had] lost her history,”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This woman’s concern about not having forums in which to share and document her own history and that of her community was not unique. Archivists and historians have discussed how to preserve and to recover LGBTQ+ histories; less attention has been given to the ways that digital humanities projects have tried to preserve and recover lost LGBTQ+ spatial histories. This article seeks to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing online projects focused on the history lost LGBTQ+ spaces, particularly women’s spaces.</p>
<p>In documenting lost LGBTQ+ spaces, these projects highlight previously overlooked marginalized historical actors and geographies. Although the scale of projects varies from local studies to national or even international, these projects seek to empower marginalized communities by acting as testimony to their existence, to provide resources for others to build upon the research, and to document particular historical phenomena. This paper will discuss the various techniques used by the creators of these projects, particularly Jan Kurth’s  “Lost Womyn’s Space”   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, Greggor Mattson’s  “Mapping Lost Lesbian Bars” , <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and my own project  “The Feminist Restaurant Project”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. It is outside of the scope of this article to look at every history website devoted to documenting or finding lost LGBTQ+ histories. Instead by narrowing it down to the scope of projects devoted to documenting lost spaces, primarily lost lesbian and queer women’s and feminist spaces on the national and international scale, this paper still provides fruitful comparison. Despite the projects’ emphasis on lesbian spatial culture, I use the LGBTQ+ umbrella. The three projects documented spaces that served a wider range of people than just lesbians. Furthermore, the problematics raised by this article relate to other lost LGBTQ+ projects, even if they are not wholly the same.</p>
<p>For this article, I analyzed the projects themselves, as well as interviewed their makers and included my own reflections as a project creator. In doing so, I explore the contribution that these websites make to the general public and scholars alike, paying particular attention to why documenting lost spaces is so necessary to understanding a community’s history. The article concludes by exploring how although lost space projects preserve narratives that have all but been erased or forgotten, these websites are vulnerable to similar preservation issues that plague both digital humanities projects and community archives, particularly those built separate from large institutions. These problems raise a number of questions, including: is lost space doomed to be lost? Can the history of LGBTQ+ space be recuperated? Is it possible to develop sustainable digital preservation initiatives that attempt to document the experiences of LGBTQ+ spaces? I argue that digital spatial history projects do not replace community archives, yet fulfill a different, complementary need. As such, the solution to the preservation of these materials rests with institutionalization within an archive large enough to provide the necessary financial and technological resources to sustain the project beyond the scope of the original, individual creator.</p>
<h2 id="who-and-what-is-lost-and-why-should-we-care">Who and What is Lost? And Why Should We Care?</h2>
<p>Historians and archivists argue over how to recover missing or marginalized communities. Archivists Joan M. Schwartz and Terry Cook posit that conventional record creation and archival practices mean that  “some can afford to create and maintain records and some cannot; that certain voices thus will be heard loudly and some not at all; that certain views and ideas about society will in turn be privileged and others marginalized”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Historians, such as Judith Bennet and Steven Maynard, and archivists, such as Randall Jimerson, have shown that socially and culturally marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ communities, have also been marginalized in archives and the discipline of history <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Resulting from the acknowledgement of this deficit and beginning in the 1960s, social history sought to reclaim histories of marginalized peoples. Archives, a vital aspect of this shift, transformed collection and preservation practices in order to reflect these new historiographical interests. Archivists Marika Cifor, Michelle Caswell, Alda Allina Migoni, and Noah Geraci have argued that this phenomenon was especially apparent in the development of community archives. When community archive movements developed as a response to the social and political movements that came to the fore in 1960s and 1970s,  “within each of these movements activists and community groups recognized the significance of writing persons and communities whose histories and lives had long been marginalized, erased, or misrepresented into the historical record”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. They show that the process of community archiving was a form of  “self-representation, identity construction, and empowerment,”  affecting both past and present <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Melinda Marie Jetté (2019), James Brooks (2019), Jodie Boyd (2019), and others have written about how necessary it is to document LGBTQ+ histories in a way that is accessible to the public in  <em>The Public Historian</em> ’s Special Issue on commemorating queer history. Despite efforts to recover the lost or marginalized histories, traditional historical and archival practices, however, do not capture all of them.</p>
<p>As a result, LGBTQ+ community archives began to rectify this gap. These community archives, such as the Lesbian Herstory Archives, often function outside of institutional support, which enables the community to preserve its own histories, but can also make the collections vulnerable to issues of funding and sustainability <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Community archives also do not preserve the histories of the entire LGBTQ+ community; in the North American context, when these communities are documented, it is often members of that community that live in large urban or coastal areas <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While not fully compensating for this deficit, LGBTQ+ archival projects also exist online. Archivist Erin O’Meara argues that collecting activists’ papers and documenting related social movements has always had inherent problems, but digital techniques complicate matters as they raise new questions around preservation <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Elise Chenier, founder of the Archives of Lesbian Oral Testimony, has several articles on the challenges of preserving lesbian digital history projects including issues of collection and retention, related to her work with oral histories <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Similarly, archivist Anthony Cocciolo discusses the challenges of establishing a digital community archive, finding that establishing and maintaining a community digital archive necessitates navigating a complex set of technological and social issues, including methods for capturing records, ownership and copyright, digitization and born-digital record keeping, social media and web archiving, and digital preservation <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. However, art historian, Roxanne Samer continues to believe in the potential of feminist and queer digital archives despite these issues, acknowledging that intergenerational sharing of knowledge through digital archives may be the key to this information surviving <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. While archivists have innovated new techniques to include more perspectives, online history projects provide complementary and alternative materials yet face similar problems. The unique nature of digital humanities projects necessitates different solutions than are required for community archives, which have historically been wary of institutionalization.</p>
<p>Access to narratives of marginalized people is impacted by accessibility of information and access to technologies. Online public history projects provide new opportunities to share materials and create new or different avenues of access apart from physical and digital archives <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Jan Kurth’s  “Lost Womyn’s Space” , Greggor Mattson’s  “Mapping Lost Lesbian Bars” , and my own project  “The Feminist Restaurant Project” , are not digital archives but rather digital humanities history projects that seek to collect, remember, and retain information about LGBTQ+ spaces. These digital history projects build upon a tradition of LGBTQ+ individuals creating and utilizing new technological forms to advocate about their communities. Their narrowed focus, particularly on the difficulty of creating and retaining lesbian and queer women’s spaces, is paralleled by the challenge of retaining records about these spaces in digital form.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-being-found-look-like-what-makes-digital-history-projects-different-than-community-archives">What Does Being Found Look Like? What Makes Digital History Projects Different than Community Archives?</h2>
<p>If to be lost is to be marginalized or erased, to be found or to find means centering LGBTQ+ histories; some history websites do exactly that. One technique for recovering marginalized histories has been to document where marginalized groups spent time. As the editors of  <em>Queers in Space</em> , Gordon Brent Ingram, Anne Bouthillette, and Yolanda Retter note, both permanent and temporary spaces were important to queer activist organizing and community building <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Geographer Julie Podmore likewise argues the importance of studying space to understand lesbian histories <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. It is not that community archives do not provide evidence of community spaces, but rather the emphasis of these websites is on documenting specifically community spaces and providing visitors with information with which to explore these spaces further. As Kurth notes,  “Certainly I have seen a lot of projects since I started Lost Womyn&rsquo;s Space that focus just on lesbian bars. I find that work of value, but I think we miss something when we don&rsquo;t look for parallels and connections with other forms of women&rsquo;s space over time and geography”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Since this research started, other projects seeking to document lesbian and queer spaces have begun. In 2017, designer Lucas LaRochelle began the community generated mapping project, Queering the Map, that geo-locates queer moments, memories and histories in relation to a world map. Unlike the three projects this article focuses on, Queering the Map seeks to represent queer memories outside of fixed queer spaces, such as gay bars or lesbian bookstores, and rather on ephemeral moments, published without dates, which happen anywhere in the world to mark experiences of queerness wherever they occur <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. While there is strong value in recording individual memory, documenting the location of more formalized geographies with fixed dates does something different; it provides a sense of space, situated in specific historical moments, to which future generations can situate themselves in relation to and build upon.</p>
<p>The three projects this article focuses on, take space seriously on a national or international scale by attending to an exploration of historical sites of LGBTQ+ socializing and political organizing. While they differ in their format and exact focus, they look at similar communities: lesbians, women with a focus on lesbians, and feminists with an emphasis on lesbian feminists. Mattson’s work specifies bars, I target restaurants, cafes, and coffeehouses, and Kurth has the widest scope, encompassing all kinds of women’s spaces and businesses. Likewise Mattson has the most specific geographic focus by looking solely at the United States, the Feminist Restaurant Project is U.S. and Canada centered, and Kurth’s work is global <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. The projects have some overlap and directly attribute the work of the other creators in their own work <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This article recognizes the different motivations of the sites’ creators and the problematic nature of the individual creator being centered. On the one hand, these projects work to represent large swaths of lesbian and queer women communities, yet on the other hand, the individuals doing the work shape them. The identities of the creators impact their ability to do this labor and may influence the willingness of others’ view of the authority of the content. That the creators of this work are predominately white, and a self identified gay man academic (Mattson), queer woman academic (Ketchum), and a lesbian non-academic (Kurth), affects which LGBTQ+ spaces are found — through who is willing to share resources with us, through our editorial choices, and through how our work is understood as authoritative or non-authoritative. Furthermore, a creator’s biases shape the form of the project and risk marginalizing or erasing histories of other marginalized groups while doing the work of recovering or showcasing lost LGBTQ+ histories. This phenomenon became particularly apparent when in 2019, Kurth made trans-exclusionary comments while discussing the lack of women’s and lesbian venues in a post. In doing so, her project that in fact includes community spaces in which transgender people worked, gathered, and socialized, now minimizes or erases these histories. Responding to the marginalization, neglect, and deletion of trans geographies and trans geographic histories, geographer Kath Browne challenges how  “gender geographies have focused on normatively gendered men and women, neglecting the ways in which gender binaries can be contested and troubled”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Browne builds on the work of Viviane Namaste and Susanne Stryker and argues that  “trans voices need to be heard and new knowledges created from the specific understandings gained through lived experiences”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. This is not to say that cisgendered creators are unable to include trans voices or representations of LGBTQ+ communities of color, but rather that the predominant whiteness and cisgendered identities of the creators of these projects affects the representation of these historical geographies. This issue is especially pertinent if the only, or majority, of projects documenting these spaces come from a white, cis perspective. While this article focuses on what it means to do the labor of recovering lost or missing histories, all to potentially lose these histories again, the individual creators’ identities impact the ability to do this work; the willingness to include or acknowledge certain people and spaces; and the form that work takes.</p>
<p>Yielding to the call to think seriously about space, digital representations such as online mapping projects, scrapbook databases, and user forums focused on space, highlight an aspect of historical preservation not fulfilled in the same manner by an archive. The projects surveyed in this article are part of a phenomenon of spatial documentation. However, typically spatial projects have focused on local regions. Creators benefit from access to insider community knowledge and histories, primarily due to the intensity of labor of gathering this information. Projects such as Found San Francisco are advantaged by focusing on a targeted local region, which allow the creators to delve in detail <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. As Jan Kurth reflected,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also enjoy the various projects that put together and catalog lost places, as that combines my interest in space and history. Typically, these efforts tend to be localized, as hunting down all these places can be pretty labor intensive. So generally, most of these projects will be devoted to particular cities, and sometimes, even more specifically, to particular bars or LGBT bars in a particular city. I had noticed that lesbian bars tend to get lost in the city lists and even the LGBT lists, so I wanted to highlight lost lesbian bars as those are rapidly disappearing. But as I played around in Google archives (later  <a href="http://newspaper.com/">newspaper.com</a>), and on the Internet in general, I came across all kinds of interesting lost, disappearing, or endangered women&rsquo;s spaces. So I thought it would be fun to have a kind of rangy blog for collecting all these places in one location.<br>
<sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although projects focused on a smaller region can be more manageable, as individuals in that community can share their stories and collective memory, national and international public history projects build awareness of the larger phenomenon of the desire for community run spaces that are occurring beyond the local level. Both types of projects are useful. Greggor Mattson agrees, remarking,  “I like all the sites that are trying to map gay bars and LGBT spaces. The New York site is the gold standard, in my view, but it&rsquo;s one that exceeds my abilities both technically and in terms of time to devote to it”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. He is referring to the NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project website, which consists of an interactive map that links to histories of each location <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Mattson’s site, rather, tries  “to be nationally comprehensive,”  yet he explains that  “it&rsquo;s tough to just make sure that all the regions are being represented.”  Mattson focused only on the United States due to language barriers and his own scholarly background. In my own experience, I focused on the United States and Canada because as a historian my training has focused on Canadian and American historiographies. Furthermore, my digital project was tied to my dissertation work in which I wanted to contextualize the development of these spaces within the legal and economic context of their times. Researching feminist restaurant histories for two countries was complicated to historically contextualize as I wanted to be specific about municipal, state/provincial, and federal laws. While my lens allowed me to speak to trends and historical phenomena regarding feminist and lesbian feminist restaurant creation, I had to sacrifice some precision; however, trying to integrate more countries would have required more generalizations than I was comfortable making. This article is concerned most specifically with the barriers of preserving LGBTQ+ spatial national and international projects, as unlike local projects, which are typically supported by regional organizations, the larger scale projects are created, updated, and preserved by individuals. For smaller scale regional projects without institutional or organizational backing, the suggestions at the end of this article will be relevant.</p>
<p>Compiling data on national and international scales can be more difficult as source materials are scattered. If this information is available on the Internet, as Kurth denoted about some of her source materials, is it really lost? As the Indiana University Lilly Library argued, when materials are in libraries, archives, or even on the Internet, they are actually the opposite of lost  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. However, information, particularly about marginalized communities, can be so scattered and inaccessible to locate that while it may not be formally lost, it can be lost. To be lost is to be unable or difficult to find. The sites surveyed in this article collate this information, bringing it together for users and often creating duplicate files of these records, which can disappear at a moment’s notice, as had been the case with Google archives. This creation of records is not the only way that these digital history projects differ from digital archives. Usually, larger projects require input from users as the creators may not be familiar with the areas discussed.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing information is a key component for revealing histories of lost spaces, especially for projects on the national and international scale. LGBTQ+ history projects particularly benefit from crowdsourcing as the former users of these spaces are less likely to have had their recollections previously recorded, as marginalized communities’ experiences are not only marginalized in historical and archival contexts, but also in the popular media <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  Greggor Mattson’s  “Mapping Lost Lesbian Bars”  utilizes crowdsourcing. He admits on his site that  “it is inevitable that there are errors in this kind of enterprise – please send me corrections and queries to”  his email and Twitter account. He likewise explains,  “Eventually I will merge this with a map of currently-open lesbian bars, which I’ll launch as a crowdsourcing effort”   <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This kind of community driven research on lost spaces benefits from a wide variety of perspectives and experiences. Crowdsourcing also generates publicity through the initial launch of the call for submissions and thus also draws more attention to these sites. On the Feminist Restaurant Project website, there are multiple calls asking visitors to contribute to the project. Although the initial directory and map were based on my amalgamation of old travel guides, periodicals, advertisements, and interviews, I created the website in part for the purpose of crowdsourcing new information. The website has a page called  “Submissions”  in which I ask users,  “Know of a feminist restaurant, cafe, or coffeehouse that existed/exists in the United States and Canada? Please check if it is listed on the database — if not, email The Feminist Restaurant Project to let us know” . Likewise above the directory I have a note asking for feedback <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Since I first launched the site in April 2015, I have only received about a dozen emails from people who found me through the site, but they were thorough, full of information, and quite helpful. The directory and its associated maps thus become living documents that grow as readership grows. As Jan Kurth has stayed anonymous on her site, her information is not crowdsourced in the same way.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  Users can post comments but cannot email her through the site. While the Lost Womyn’s Spaces site shows that crowdsourcing is not the only technique creators can use to collect information, the method is still valuable. The creation of websites with maps and directories, like those of Mattson and my own, allow for users to get directly involved, turning the site into a kind of community project/ archive.</p>
<p>Social media works as an invaluable tool for crowdsourcing information for these digital history projects. Mattson finds information through social media and spreads awareness about his research on Twitter. He found that  “most gay bars communicate better on Facebook than by phone or e-mail”   <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Facebook enabled him to contact bar owners for interviews. He then used his social media presence and his website as a way to add credibility to his requests, explaining,  “I thought it would be useful for them to see that they were part of something bigger to induce them to accept my request for an interview. I wanted them to see that this was something I&rsquo;d been thinking about for a while and that I was serious”   <sup id="fnref2:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. I, likewise, have found social media sites, particularly Facebook and Twitter to be invaluable resources <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. Facebook group administrators allowed me to join their online communities and pose questions to the members, asking if people had resources about other feminist restaurants or if they wanted to be interviewed. Like Mattson, I used my website, The Feminist Restaurant Project, to demonstrate the work I had already done on the topic and had a publicly available source that could be shared within these communities. I used Twitter to connect with people whose email addresses I did not have or could not find, as well as to publicize the project. As my research progressed, I was able to use these social media channels as a way to keep the community informed about the state of the project and publications. It has been a relationship of reciprocity.</p>
<p>Community archives do rely on donations from community members, but the kind of exchange on these websites is different. Digital LGBTQ+ spatial history projects collect scattered information from around the Internet, from physical archives, guide and travel books, and the oral histories and shared memories of community members. These digital projects thus, do not only gather information that could not be found in a single community archive, but the process of creating these sites produces knowledge. Users are motivated to share stories that would otherwise perish along with them. While similar to community archives, these digital projects do something different. This difference is made clear in how their information is displayed.</p>
<h2 id="visuals-spatial-histories-and-what-digital-history-projects-offer-that-community-archives-do-not">Visuals: Spatial Histories and What Digital History Projects Offer that Community Archives Do Not</h2>
<p>To be lost is to be hidden or unseen. To be found is to be revealed. Even our language around being lost and found speaks to visual culture. All three sites use visuals in different ways to draw in readers and contribute to underlying arguments. In Kurth’s scrapbook format, where she pastes any relevant information within the blog post, she includes photographs of the businesses when available, Google Streetview images of the buildings when an address was known, and other photos and illustrations. Mattson, likewise  “found it touching to use Google street view and have a look at the outside of the buildings when it was still a lesbian bar: the rainbows or triangles or posters for women&rsquo;s bands”   <sup id="fnref3:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. He had a research assistant take the screenshots and post them so that as Google Streetview updates with the new exteriors, at least one image of the bar would remain. He remarks  “I have no pictures of the gay bars that I&rsquo;ve liked to visit, in part because I&rsquo;m old fashioned about not taking pictures in or around gay bars in case someone is closeted,”   <sup id="fnref4:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> yet he knows how valuable these visuals can also be. While the display of this visual information differs between the three sites, none follow the format of digital archives’ formatting of folders filled with jpegs of images from the physical archives or reproduced text, as is the case with projects like the Queer Zine Archives and the Lesbian Herstory Archives.</p>
<p>Apart from physical pictures, these websites provide other visual cues that speak to the existence of lost communities. Kurth’s website’s side bar, that shows the number of blog post entries written per month, is another powerful visual that conveys how many spaces existed that are now lost. The 652 posts make clear that these spaces were not a rare or isolated phenomenon. I was, likewise, motivated by the visual power of numbers when I decided to make my directory and maps publicly available. An immediate benefit of quantitative mapping techniques is that they show the preponderance of these spaces. Based on my initial estimates before beginning my research, I guessed that there were, at most, 40 feminist restaurants, cafés, and coffeehouses in America and Canada. In fact, the number of verified feminist restaurants, cafés, and coffeehouses from the 1972-1989 is over 250 and, further, there are over 430 unverified spaces, and it is likely, feminist spaces are included in this set. The verified and unverified spaces are color coded with pink and blue markings on the site. These visual cues help quantify the space.</p>
<p>One approach to understanding lesbian feminist history is to mark where women gathered. Maps can change conceptualizations of the past in ways that narratives cannot alone.</p>
<p>Both Mattson and I use maps to serve multiple purposes. Some of my maps simply show where places actually existed, some show the variety of feminist businesses in a single area during a single year, based only on one guidebook, and some are part of a larger history project, which takes information from interviewees and provides a space for continual community building, through memory sharing. The initial goal was to map out the locations of feminist restaurants and cafés, the types of women’s spaces that I have chosen to focus on, within the United States and Canada from 1972 to 1989, a process never before completed. From this map it is possible construct a sense of what the feminist and lesbian community in a particular space and time looked like. A large, public map served the goal of drawing attention to the legacy of the women founders of feminist restaurants, cafés, and coffeehouses who made this project feasible by making this information as publicly accessible as possible and also by developing new forums in which former participants could expand their community, during a time when many women’s spaces are closing or have closed. Greggor Mattson shared a similar motivation. He explains  “I like making Google maps because they help me visualize things alongside other sets of data&hellip; for example, I can use Social Explorer to eyeball whether it resembles population density, or I can use Google&rsquo;s Street View to have a look at the building and neighborhood that the bar is/was located in”   <sup id="fnref5:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. The map was both beneficial for visualizing results and analysis. He realized that these images could be useful for his readers, noting that,  “I guess I felt like I&rsquo;d gone to this trouble of helping map where these lesbian bars had been, that I might as well share it with others”   <sup id="fnref6:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Maps allow users to interact with information and provide powerful visuals. The time has come to take space seriously, not just intellectually but methodologically, in researching the past; creating publicly available maps enables this pursuit.</p>
<h2 id="format-and-the-individual">Format and the Individual</h2>
<p>Choices regarding format also shapes the way that users interact with the site and understand the motivations and intentions of the creators. Mattson’s and my site explicitly mention our larger academic projects with which the public sites are correlated. The matter is more complicated with Lost Womyn’s Spaces. Kurth notes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I chose the format I have so that I would be highlighting individual places, and highlighting the details of that particular place&rsquo;s existence. I like specificity. I think that theoretical generalizations are often in danger of wandering too far afield if care is not taken. The trade off is that some readers may get caught up in the details, and not be able to see the patterns I think are pretty clear that run across the histories of many former women&rsquo;s places. Clearly some readers are only interested in a particular bar they used to go to back in the 80s, and that&rsquo;s fine. I have sometimes thought I should write some sort of essay highlighting the patterns with all the documentation I have collected, but honestly, I don&rsquo;t know how many would be interested and I really don&rsquo;t have the time.<br>
<sup id="fnref3:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She does actually include some editorializing information within her posts, supplying commentary in the margins. While Kurth states that the scrapbook style can be utilized as users wish, she also somewhat directs readers toward her argument, noting  “I think my motivation has been pretty much the same, which is to create an outlet for a very wide range of lost women&rsquo;s spaces. But the more places I collected, the more I saw certain patterns that most don&rsquo;t know, so I like to highlight those and bring them to the attention of readers”   <sup id="fnref4:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Between March 2011 and June 2019, she wrote over 652 posts. Most posts focus on the history of a single space and are typically a collection of newspaper articles, advertisements, entries on review sites such as Yelp, and whatever photos and other information she can find pasted in what she calls her blog scrapbook formatting. However more significantly, Lost Womyn’s Space’s format reflected Kurth’s desire to provide records of a smattering of spaces that users can engage with as desired, rather than be directed. Kurth believes that  “it&rsquo;s fun to have a blog to throw things on that are interesting. There is so much available on the Internet right now that really needs to be curated in some way to make it more accessible in a single location”   <sup id="fnref5:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Having read all 652 posts, these arguments begin to come through clearly, yet if a user just reads one or two posts, the details of the scrapbook format tend to dominate reader experience.</p>
<p>What is clear is that each website’s specifics relate to the individuality of their creators. As each of these three projects are created primarily by one person, our individual experiences, motivations, educational backgrounds, and biases shape the projects. Our geographic focuses are influenced by language and cultural knowledge. Even when Kurth has tried to include information from countries around the world, she  “realized pretty early that Google search engines keep corralling me back to English language sites, which means the focus is on English speaking countries. Occasionally I&rsquo;d figure out a strategy to break free, but I haven&rsquo;t found as much as I would like outside the US, Canada, UK, etc.”   <sup id="fnref6:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Apart from geographic positioning, our training has shaped our methodologies in creating these websites. I had previously worked as a research assistant which tracked changes in every edition of the Canadian Medical Directory and that influenced my methodology to track edition changes in directories and guidebooks. While we all worked on related topics, our specific training and skills impacted our methodological choices and thus the end product. And so, while these projects are for the greater public and larger community, each site carries its author’s fingerprints. Having an individual’s viewpoint does not negate the usefulness of these sites, as individuals also shape documentation in community archives. However, it is this tie to the individual that puts these projects in danger.</p>
<h2 id="failures-and-finishing">Failures and Finishing</h2>
<p>None of these projects were built in a single attempt, but rather were evolving undertakings where the creators have adapted, changed, and experimented. Jan Kurth has worked on her site since 2011, my site went live in 2015, and Mattson’s page with maps launched on September 17, 2016. Each creator dealt with failures that required innovation. Mattson had difficulties with his social media accounts. His Twitter project (@WhoNeedsGayBars) never really took off like he thought it would. He originally believed that users would communicate with him and follow the project through Twitter, but most of his followers were bots. Rather than functioning as a news stream about gay bars, as it was originally intended, Mattson uses his site as a way to be able to scroll through a timeline of articles <sup id="fnref7:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. I had a similar experience of making assumptions about what users would want and initially completely missed the mark. I spent months researching different map-making applications that would allow users to upload information to the site. I experimented with Nunaliit, Postscrap, Google Social Maps Experience, and Esri’s Story Map Crowdsource (beta), and eventually chose Story Map.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  I later learned that users preferred to communicate with me via email and have me make the changes on the map, rather than each person altering the map herself. These stories of failure also point to the fact that these projects can continuously be improved, begging the question: can a lost project ever truly be complete?</p>
<p>Unlike a published book, public history websites can be updated ad infinitum, forcing creators to decide when to end the project. Placing parameters on a project allows for a sense of completion. Mattson chose to restrict his project to the 10-year timeframe of 2006-2016. However, he explains that  “I&rsquo;ve got a larger project that is using LGBT guidebooks to track the closures of bars for lesbians, and this mapping project turned out to be just an early version of the larger one. In those early stages I thought I was going to find that gay bars were just closing, but it turns out it&rsquo;s a much more complicated picture. Even for lesbian bars, at least three have opened this year. No one has created a  Found Womyn&rsquo;s Spaces Blog,  so tracking only the closures of what are, in the end, small businesses, doesn&rsquo;t capture the new ones that arise”   <sup id="fnref8:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. While the Mapping Lost Bars project is complete, it is part of a larger, ongoing endeavor. For my project, the completion of my dissertation produced one kind of ending. However, as I turn my dissertation into a book manuscript, I continue to update the site. Also, as I publish more information about the topic of feminist restaurants, including academic articles and non-academic books, I include that information on the website. The maps I built originally in 2015 based off of the women’s/lesbian guidebooks, a kind of methodology that Mattson has begun to likewise use to track bar closures, have only been updated a few times since the website originally launched. I have considered working with a research assistant or information studies scholar to digitize and make word searchable every copy of Gaia’s Guides and map every single kind of business mentioned with color codes. I have also considered making the map specific down to addresses, rather than just city centers and include photos, histories, and personal stories, similar to the NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project website. However, I currently do not have the resources to enact these changes. After years of keeping The Feminist Restaurant Project updated, my work on the site has slowed. Jan Kurth shares a similar sentiment stating,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suppose I could quit at any time and it would be more or less complete. I still see mention of lost lesbian bars now and then, so I&rsquo;ll add those as time permits. Or maybe search for an old ad for a ladies cafe from 1900. But because of a lot more demands on my time these days, I just don&rsquo;t have the same hours to devote to this as I used to. I don&rsquo;t really see an &ldquo;end goal&rdquo; as the thing doesn&rsquo;t really have a beginning. It is what it is, I suppose.<br>
<sup id="fnref7:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mattson did most of his work over eighteen months. I spent four years actively updating the site. Jan Kurth has spent seven years on her site but has decreased her rate of posting over the past three years. Between June 2019 and June 2020, she did not write a single post. These projects point to the difficulties of sustaining these kinds of ventures. “Lost” spaces keep being lost. History keeps expanding. An individual’s resources, however, have limitations. The topic of endings speaks to larger questions regarding maintenance and preservation.</p>
<h2 id="preservation-is-lost-space-doomed-to-be-lost">Preservation: is lost space doomed to be lost? </h2>
<p>The process of finding lost spaces is about creating a record. The projects discussed in this article host their records online. Rapidly changing file formats, domain name ownerships lapsing, and new technologies threaten preservation. The struggle to keep resources up-to-date and accessible has led historians and archivists to fear that the current era will be the digital Dark Ages for future generations. Websites disappear. Head of the British Library&rsquo;s web archiving program, Stephen Bury, explained how the program preserved important records that only existed online, noting that  “if we hadn&rsquo;t done that nobody would have access to the information, the photographs, the interviews on that site”   <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  Keeping websites functioning and up-to-date is a specific struggle that requires constant maintenance, necessitating labor and financial resources. While the British Library has financial resources for this kind of work, all three of the projects surveyed in this article are maintained by individuals without any dedicated institutional funding.</p>
<p>Maintaining digital resources, especially projects independent of large institutional resources, is difficult. Greggor Mattson explains that his site  “will live on my Google page forever, I guess, but until you asked it never occurred to me that it might be something that would interest an archive. But it&rsquo;s true: who archives the exteriors of the lesbian bars of Salt Lake City or Tulsa?”   <sup id="fnref9:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Kurth said she has not given thought of how to preserve the work but is interested in ideas. I, too, am unsure of how to proceed. I built the site on Google’s Blogger platform so that I would not have to pay hosting fees and just pay a modest fee of around fifteen dollars yearly to maintain my domain name. However, the site is vulnerable to the whims of Google, which could decide to end Blogger and Google Maps. The site also requires frequent maintenance and updates. All of this work depends on my donated labor and is vulnerable to my own mortality <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. Outside of saving the posts as Word file documents and saving them on external hard drives and digital storage, personal attempts at preservation flounder. When I posed this question to readers of my site, the only solution offered was the Internet Archive <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. The Internet Archive, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, is building a digital library of Internet sites and other cultural artifacts in digital form; for example, it saved copies of The Feminist Restaurant Project 27 times between May 9, 2015 and August 24, 2018. Despite the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine preserving 341 billion web pages over the past twenty years, it is only useful if users know what they are searching for. Also, it seems precarious to depend exclusively on this single site. While the Internet has been touted as a democratization of knowledges and a tool for making knowledge more accessible, the ephemeral quality of digital resources challenges this narrative of accessibility. How do we as public historians and archivists preserve digital projects? Is our work fated to disappear?</p>
<p>As scholars Marika Cifor and Stacy Wood demonstrate, archives and public history projects centered on marginalized, particularly LGBTQ+ communities have often decided to remain independent and not join with an institution. Elise Chenier likewise explains that  “one of the major concerns expressed about the current shift of LGBTQ materials from community-based archives to institutional libraries, archives, and special collections is that collections will no longer be shaped by LGBTQ praxis”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. They report that organizations such as the Lesbian Herstory Archives (LHA) are  “decidedly suspect of the long-term investment in and commitment to these initiatives [and as a result] many organizations chose to keep collecting efforts autonomous and community driven, ensuring that collections, policies, and materials were not subject to changing priorities within universities”   <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. However, as evidenced above, by the example of the British Library’s Web Archiving project, institutions provide more funding stability and are not predicated on one individual’s circumstances in the same way.</p>
<p>Perhaps some compromise can be made. Ann Cvetkovich has proposed  “Queer Archive Activism”  that calls for something beyond the financial and infrastructural support of the institution, but also requires space for active engagement with materials and a space for housing materials that push against traditional archival notions of evidentiary value <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. This debate between institution and community driven projects continues <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. Online history projects serve a kind of counter narrative to the erasure or marginalization of LGBTQ+ histories; however, with their creation comes new challenges. Since these digital history projects are different than community archives and rather than dependent on a small group are so tied to one individual, institutionalization within an archive that has the financial and technological resources to sustain or retain the project is necessary. To be incorporated within that institution would help maintain these projects, which serve as valuable resources to understanding LGBTQ+ spatial histories. Moving away from a burden on the individual and towards institutionalization will give these projects a greater chance of survival. Ideally, community members will be included and the kind of engagement that Cvetkovich proposes can exist. As Kurth states,  “If somebody else wants to take one or more of these places and do more research that&rsquo;s great! Or even come up with their own observations and generalizations based on the data. I have no problem with that at all. I welcome it”   <sup id="fnref8:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Mattson and I share a similar sentiment, hoping that our work of collecting and retaining will be built upon. In order for the future work to be done, these sites must be preserved and institutionalization will enable this work.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The stakes of preserving the history of lost LGBTQ+ spaces are high. Directors of the Lesbian and Gay Liberation in Canada, Michelle Schwartz and Constance Crompton discuss how history-making practices of lesbian feminists offer a model of cultural history preservation and transmission for those who create digital resources. They write that  “while this history-making situates researchers and their sisters in relation to lost history, there is something in the perpetual reinvigoration and revisiting of these lists and projects, often started anew every decade, which leads us to ask about the lack of cultural transmission between lesbian generations”   <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. In particular, they argue that even though individuals should maintain a right to privacy and a right to be forgotten,  “we must also weigh the danger to both feminism and queer politics of hiding our history, forcing each new generation to start anew, with only the haziest stereotypes about previous generations to draw on for strength, or worse, to look on with derision, against the threat of confrontation, doxing, or violence to named activists”   <sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Without proper preservation lost history projects risk being lost or re-forgotten, forcing future generations to repeat the work of recovery.</p>
<p>This article has focused on online history projects that center women’s, lesbian, and queer women’s spaces within a greater narrative of reclaiming LGBTQ+ spaces as a way to study histories of marginalized peoples. Jan Kurth’s  “Lost Womyn’s Space” , Greggor Mattson’s  “Mapping Lost Lesbian Bars” , and my own project  “The Feminist Restaurant Project”  use crowdsourcing, social media, visuals, and mapping in order to inspire other researchers, contribute to the collective memory of LGBTQ+ communities, and further the creators’ other work. Lost space projects are important. These digital projects highlight lost or marginalized historical actors. In the case of the endeavors studied in this article, women’s, lesbian, feminist, and queer spaces bring attention to histories that have been lost or forgotten and speak to larger conversations within history, archival research, and digital humanities about the need to document and preserve materials and stories of marginalized communities. However, as these projects rely on the efforts of individuals, and are divorced from institutional support and self-funded, they are vulnerable to being re-lost or re-forgotten. Institutionalization is necessary for their survival and can free future generations from needing to repeat this labor. To institutionalize or archive an individual project merely ends a single iteration of the work. By preserving these sites, my hope is that future generations will build upon and adapt these projects to new futures and circumstances.</p>

<p>This technique is not exclusive to LGBTQ+ focused history projects. The non-LGBTQ+ project, the  “Lost Pub Project”  which documents the decline of the English pub, has compiled over 35,000 entries. On the website, which functions as a kind of directory, the makers write,  “Help our community project to archive these lost pubs before they are forgotten forever. If you know of a pub which has closed at any time in the past, please submit it, together with any anecdotes, historical information or photographs that you might have.”  They further ask users to check for inconsistencies, writing that  “pubs do re-open from time to time, so if you see one on the site that is open please let us know.”  The creators share information on their website, Facebook, and twitter channels and users can check the database by clicking on city/town names and seeing listings. While the Lost Pub Project shows that lost LGBTQ+ pages are not unique in their use crowdsourcing, the technique is still valuable. As of October 31, 2018, the site features 35, 323 lost pubs, together with 20,509 photos.&#160;<a href="#fnref:29" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Picking the right kind of software to create a public map that invited user feedback was particularly difficult in 2013. At first, there was no application that directly suited my needs. Initially I considered Nunaliit and Postscrap, both developed by University of Carleton geographers. Neither fit the exact needs of the project because of the frameworks they necessitated. Further, the Google Social Maps Experience did not give the researcher oversight and editing capabilities over the content, leaving the opportunity for the map to be trolled. On that application, if a map was publicly available, anyone could add or delete data and, because of this, users might be less likely to feel safe uploading their content knowing that it could be changed or deleted by anyone. In 2016, Esri launched Story Map, a map builder that allowed anyone to create an account or use one’s Google profile or Facebook account to post onto the map. Story Map Crowdsource (beta) is an ArcGIS web application designed to collect photos and captions from anyone and display them on a map that Esri kept in beta until 2018. The application was easy to use and configure, and could be used in a web browser on laptop and desktop computers, mobile phones, and tablets. Contributors can sign in with their Facebook, Google, ArcGIS account, or participate as an anonymous guest. Further, creators of the map have oversight over the content. The program thus allows for a good balance of permitting users to not have to commit too much personal information in order to participate, but still know that their contribution is relatively safe. There are some drawbacks however, besides the $2,500 annual subscription fee, which was thankfully covered by McGill University. It was not possible to upload or create a non-editable basemap without it being at risk of deletion, due to the Beta status of the program. Ideally it would have been possible to just export my master Google Map as a kml file, convert it to an ArcGIs readable file, which is readable by ArcGIS, the software Esri relies upon, and then use those points as a background layer over which users would be able to only edit a top layer. Also, currently, users are supposed to upload a photo and do not have the option to solely upload text. As a workaround, I suggested that users just upload a photo of a square and then write their text, but this situation is less than ideal. A positive aspect of this system is that the Esri program is quite user friendly and requires very little web literacy, relative to other mapping software. However, despite the friendly interface, some of these issues dissuaded some potential users. Another issue is that, unlike QGIS, which uses Python, the Esri site does not allow for the development of plugins in the Beta version. Nonetheless, in September 2016, the Feminist Restaurant Crowdsource StoryMap launched and was embedded in  “The Feminist Restaurant Project”  website. And after all of that- no one used it. Users preferred emailing me about their own narratives or communicating with me in other ways. The site’s users were not interested in actually making the map themselves, despite saying that they were. People liked the idea of it existing and talked about that being an exciting option but ultimately were not interested in map making. It turns out that my simpler Google maps were preferable for the communities I was engaging with.&#160;<a href="#fnref:32" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

The existing scholarship on the uptake of Slack within these non-commercial environments still tends to focus on productivity or effectiveness.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  However, particularly in an educational context, we challenge the idea that efficiency and productivity are the most important features for a tool to offer a community; we therefore examine our team’s use of Slack for its ability to nurture affective connections.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The Old Books, New Science (OBNS) Lab,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  a group of faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates, and digital librarians at the University of Toronto (U of T), has been using Slack since May 2016. As members of this lab, and users of its Slack, we argue that Slack creates virtual spaces for informal interaction which, when embraced by a community, can substitute for the accidental collisions that enable collaboration in shared physical spaces. Because of how we choose to use Slack, it does not simply facilitate our scholarly communication: it also serves as a powerful affective network, bringing together scholars and technologists across generations in new and sometimes unexpected configurations.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  Our online Slack communities and the local in-person communities do not perfectly overlap, but they do intersect.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  Affective connections are supported both through the informal language of Slack comment threads and through the richly communicative emoji used by lab members. As we will discuss more fully, our particular usage of emoji in these virtual spaces differs from usage described in previous research on emoji, which focuses on romantic relationships and purely professional work communication. We will show that, by using emoji with community-defined meanings to react publicly to others’ posts, members of our Slack fortify community norms and build affective bonds. Such usage of Slack may, however, also have a dark side: by celebrating affective community in the workspace, what happens to the distinction between home and office, and consequent erosion of leisure time? We argue that communities have a choice in how to adopt technologies, and that the affective practices of the OBNS Slack allow personal and professional boundaries to be blurred in such a way as to prioritize the personal.</p>
<p>Our survey of OBNS Slack usage includes graphs summarizing channel participation and representative samples from user practice. We go on to address particularities, focusing on the ways that the supple and adaptive nature of the channels –– and especially the generative language of emoji –– participate in the evolution of our affective professional community. We will suggest that the flexible nature of Slack channels and emoji vocabulary permits a level of control and independence that allows individual users to shape the local Slack community, and thus participate collectively in the formation of online virtual spaces that provide safety to their members and –– at least potentially –– serve as a site of resistance.</p>
<h2 id="slack-overview-and-initial-adoption">Slack Overview and Initial Adoption</h2>
<p>The OBNS lab was modelled after a science or engineering department’s lab system, where individual researchers share their own work as well as contribute to a common project. As the lab evolved, it grew from a weekly group supervisory session for Alexandra Gillespie’s graduate students to become the nexus for a grant-funded research endeavour,  “Digital Tools for Manuscript Study”  (DTMS), which involved multiple units at U of T, including scholars from CMS and librarians from ITS.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  The collaboration necessary to meet project goals required constant communication and regular supplementation of project-related context from each of the two teams. However, while ITS members worked together in a central office, CMS-based OBNS members did not have dedicated space and were based at two different U of T campuses. This limited opportunities to meet face-to-face outside of the weekly lab meeting.</p>
<p>When we started using Slack about halfway through the first year of the project, it significantly lowered our email burden (especially planning and scheduling emails), while also opening up new possibilities for informal communication outside of the weekly lab meetings. If anyone had a question that did not seem serious enough for email, they could send a quick Slack message instead. This became especially useful for OBNS graduate students away on research trips. The paleography channels #digitaltoolsmss and #canyoureadthis continue to provide opportunities for instant collaboration and advice when an OBNS member is working remotely, enhancing the group’s collaborative culture. Furthermore, since Slack conversations (unlike emails) are a semi-public record that anyone in the Slack workspace can access, new students or employees who were not present for previous conversations found they were able to contribute to existing communications as soon as they had joined.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>We created individual channels for discussing development needs and giving detailed feedback on usability issues during the testing phase of DTMS. In addition, we were able to invite external collaborators as single-channel guests to discuss tool development, stakeholder meetings, or grant applications. For example, one of our projects, <a href="#viscoll2018">VisColl (2018)</a>, involved substantial collaboration with Dot Porter, Curator of Digital Research Services in the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies at the University of Pennsylvania; rather than work with unwieldy conference calls or expensive in-person visits, we did most of our collaboration on Slack.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Having outlined the initial adoption of Slack in the OBNS lab, including the basic channel configurations, usage patterns, and user experiences, we turn now to the development of the OBNS Slack over time, focusing especially on how the virtual spaces of the Slack environment serve its users. We deliberately use the term virtual spaces (in the plural) because while Slack is often represented as a virtual space (singular) that provides an alternative or a complement to the physical, in-person meeting environment, OBNS experience of Slack has consisted instead of a wide range of interlinked virtual rooms that members enter, participate in, and leave at will. In this respect OBNS’s findings are similar to those of other Slack communities.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  However, rather than invigilate the division of these channels to ensure that channel activity stays separate, members of our Slack participate in different channels in an ad hoc and flexible way, with little to no moderation. Some of these channels are shared, some private; some last over a long period of time, others are contingent. Some channels are intended for specific projects, others to serve a community-based need.</p>
<p>In the paragraphs below, we describe the ways in which channel usage developed over time, offering the outlines of an ontology of OBNS experience with Slack. We emphasize that this usage is not prescriptive, but descriptive, recognizing that other research communities will take different paths with their Slack usage. We then turn to emoji, focusing on how these too developed over time. We note differing patterns of emoji usage across our Slack, and describe the wide variety of user experience in the OBNS community. In particular, we distinguish between different modes of emoji usage, ranging from the affective (which purposely seeks to comment on and inflect the text input of other group members) to what we have labelled the decorative, which serves a very different function — although the decorative emoji, too, add to the overall affective community grown and fostered in the OBNS Slack environment.</p>

<p>Channel activity within the OBNS community quickly expanded beyond the default #general and #random channels. We now have, among other channels, #pedagogy, #tolkien, #grumbling, and, the most popular, #daily_cat, where members of the team post their cats (and dogs, and birds, and even turtles). Figure 1 shows a detailed breakdown of OBNS Slack’s public channels and their lifespans. Each bar stretches from the channel’s creation to the date of its most recent message.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  Orange channels are those which have reached a natural end, and are no longer in active use. These retired channels fall into two broad categories: most were created to support time-limited projects which were ultimately completed (e.g., #ncs2018 for the New Chaucer Society conference hosted at U of T); the other two channels, #daily-check-in and #asana (named for the productivity tool containing several projects’ to-do lists), were accountability channels which faded from use due to shifts in the OBNS user culture. The evolving nature of the culture can also be seen in the needs met by each new channel. As Figure‌‌ 2 shows more clearly, channel creation ebbs and flows over time. Early channels like #digitaltoolsmss, #stow, and #canterburytales are all project-focused workspaces.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  The addition in August 2016 of #humanresources (a slightly tongue-in-cheek name for the channel in which research assistants working on various projects are reminded with animated gifs to submit their monthly timesheets) reveals the Slack’s burgeoning role as the centre of multiple financial relationships. It was not until the emergence of #daily_cat in November 2016, six months after OBNS began using Slack, that the first purely non-work-related channel beyond #random was created.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  It was followed by #grumbling, a distinctly personal space to vent negative feelings and receive sympathy, but also by #canyoureadthis, a work-oriented channel for lab members to share illegible manuscript images. As the Slack grows, each channel constitutes its own space, with distinctive social patterns and norms. Some project-focused channels host extended ongoing conversations, such as the #slackmetachannel that shaped this very paper.</p>
<p>When someone initially enters such a channel, they often need to catch up on previous messages in order to respond, and much conversation occurs as live back-and-forth. Conversely, some channels, such as #daily_cat and #poetry_channel, are more asynchronous: members can browse the back catalogue of posts if they choose, but can also contribute a cat photo or a poem without addressing previous posts. Most channels fall between these two ends of the spectrum, including #general.</p>
<p>The #general channel, as the only channel to which every full member must subscribe, is usually intended to be a low-traffic channel for major announcements only.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  However, in our Slack, announcements often spur conversations, giving the channel more a feeling of a common room than of a podium. Indeed, 91% of the members of #general have posted in the channel, indicating that it is a space in which even junior members of the lab are able to converse. In contrast, #humanresources was specifically created to be a place where little conversation happens and thus urgent materials would not get lost in a flood of commentary. Only 53% of its members have posted messages.</p>

        <p>The total number of messages sent between all users each month, as direct messages, posts in public channels, and posts in private channels.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite their importance to the Slack as a whole, all of the public channels combined are home to less than half of the total messages sent in OBNS Slack. As Figure 3 shows, messages in public channels are always outnumbered by direct messages. Messages are counted by Slack as direct messages (DMs) regardless of whether they are sent between only two people or are in ad hoc groups defined by their participants, as in a group text message. Such DMs massively outnumber private channels, the other method by which members can talk outside of public channels.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  The lab’s reliance on DMs is somewhat unusual: in an educational application of Slack described by Spencer Ross, for example, private channels were the most popular communication venue (making up 43% of all messages sent), followed by DMs (33%), and then public channels (23%) <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  The OBNS lab’s high volume of direct messages overall shows that the lab prioritizes the affective structures of one-on-one or small-group conversations. While private channels are defined by their subject matter and talk within them is therefore restricted to a single purpose, DMs are defined by their participants, not their topics. Private conversations without set topics allows mingled discussion in which nothing is off topic. In the course of one DM thread between two co-authors of this article, for example, conversational ground covered the logistics of cat-sitting, the intensive work of writing a report for a different department, and career advice — topics that are all unrelated to any official lab project.</p>
<p>The presence of such a robust DM environment speaks to the lived-in feeling of the Slack. OBNS Slack culture is more than the representative digital space in which members operate publicly , both because of the robust and multiple levels of exchange that take place within the Slack, and because private conversations that take place in DMs support the development of personal friendships that are manifested both virtually and in person. The accessibility of contact via DMs contributes to a sense that one’s labmates are always close by, easily contacted for a casual question or to share an anecdote. In a physical, in-person workspace, it is impossible to truly separate the personal and professional because of personal interactions that are spurred on by directly  <em>perceivable</em>  traits that people cannot hide (like a new haircut, or an upset facial expression). On a Slack with a low DM ratio, one could see an artificial professional talk only space begin to develop that would not be possible in a real-world workplace. In contrast, OBNS Slack’s high DM count reinforces the manner in which it operates as a true virtual work  <em>space</em> , with varied methods of communication and interaction.</p>
<h2 id="emoji-and-affect">Emoji and Affect</h2>
<p>Our examination of emoji has little precedent in the existing literature. <a href="#bai2019">Bai 2019</a>’s systematic review of 167 research articles about emoji identified several common approaches to studying emoji in different fields. Research in computer science, marketing, medicine, and education (85 articles, or 50%) typically attempts to understand the meanings of specific emoji, or presents case studies using emoji to conduct surveys.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  Psychology and communications research (53 articles, or 32%) largely seeks to describe personal or cultural contexts which shape emoji usage, especially the quantity of usage.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  Research in linguistics and behavioural science (31 articles, or 18%) explores questions most similar to our own: scholars in these fields examine the content and function of specific communications taking place with emoji, and describe the interpersonal motivation and impact of these communications. Some linguistics research, such as <a href="#jibril2013">Jibril (2013)</a> and <a href="#l%C3%B3pez2017">López (2017)</a> has tried to assess whether emoji can function as their own language, but most linguists (such as <a href="#alshenqeeti2016">Alshenqeeti (2016)</a> and <a href="#naaman2017">Na&rsquo;aman (2017)</a>) instead seek to describe how emoji contribute nonverbal content to impact the interpretation of written language. Most directly related to our own case study of our communication with each other, behavioural science researchers have described how emoji can manage and maintain interpersonal relationships <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, or construct and express a personal identity <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. However, even in this last category of research, describing the role of emoji in personal relationships and identity, there is no direct comparison for our case study. Existing work discusses emoji use in either private one-on-one personal conversations or in large-scale public or semi-public social networks like Twitter and Facebook,<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  both of which have different core dynamics than the medium-sized group conversations which take place on Slack. It is a sign of the affective nature of our usage of Slack that the best parallels to our emoji use come from the papers on intimate relationships, such as <a href="#kelly2015">Kelly (2015)</a>. In their study of two-person text message exchanges,<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  Kelly and Watts identify three overlapping uses of emoji that are  “relationally meaningful,”  each of which are at play in lab communications: emoji are used to maintain a conversational connection, to permit play, and to create what they term a sense of  “shared and secret uniqueness”   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Although creative use of emoji was a part of the OBNS Slack culture from its first day, emoji usage increased and gained complexity over time. A turning point in both channel development and emoji usage occurred in our early experimentation with a #daily-check-in channel. Each morning, a bot would message each Slack member to generate the channel’s content by asking in sequence for each member to define yesterday’s accomplishments, today’s goals, and current obstacles. As each member wrote about their daily tasks, however, the affective side to the lab unfolded. Obstacles of sickness, frustration, and personal grief were met first tentatively and then confidently with demonstrations of care. The lab’s early emoji use is comparatively sparse, clustering around expressions of illness or frustration with emoji indicating empathy, and around photos of pets shared to cheer or comfort.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  Over time, as lab members became more comfortable with sharing the personal and affective, emoji use expanded to celebrate or cheer on personal goals and victories in teaching, academic work, or administration.</p>

<p>November 2016 saw the creation of a new channel, #daily_cat, which was the first channel after #random to have a specific non-project focus, and which confirmed OBNS Slack’s focus on care as an integral part of the digital workplace experience. As #daily-check-in filled with expressions of empathy and personal struggles in addition to its original more narrow aim of self-assessment and goal-setting, lab members began sharing pictures of cute animals to cheer each other up. Originally intended to save #daily-check-in from increasing numbers of cat photos, #daily_cat became a voluntary, recreational place where members of OBNS, no matter their employment status or place in the academic hierarchy, were equal in their love of felines. Lab members posted photos of their own cats, or of cats they encountered in the wild; others contributed pictures of internet cats or other cute animals. Cat soon came to mean any animal: lab members have posted photos of dogs, turtles, birds, and more.</p>

        <p>May 1, 2017: Chloe’s adoption, announced on Slack.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Certain cats, especially those owned by lab members, became celebrities. Jacquelyn Clements, one of #daily-check-in’s prolific cat-posters, fostered cats for a few months just as #daily_cat was becoming active and shared photographs with the channel. Soon lab members became invested in the saga of Chloe, a beautiful black and white longhair, and her search for a forever home. After a near-miss with a potential adopter, Chloe eventually became a foster fail and was adopted by Clements, much to the jubilation of #daily_cat. Chloe’s adoption elicited a platter (i.e., long string) of emoji, including the first example of a custom lab cat emoji. In Figure  6, the fourth emoji reacting to the news is itself a custom emoji created from the photograph of her at her adoption. Custom emoji for specific cats have become commonplace in #daily_cat; the creation of a new custom emoji indicates that the cat is now part of the wider OBNS community. These custom emoji serve not only as a way of welcoming new cats into the #daily_cat rotation, but also creating a sense of permanence and belonging for the new lab member. These emoji may then be used throughout the Slack as an expression of care. One example is that of :cat-hug:, which is commonly used to denote reassurance and caring for a team member in need of encouragement. Originally a photograph of Akbari’s cats Bob and Charles snuggling, captioned  “Hold still and let me wash you,”  its wider use transcends its origin in #daily_cat — so much so that one lab member was unaware that it represented specific lab cats.</p>

<p>These personalized cat emoji led to a wave of tea emoji, celebratory emoji including a rainbow sheep and dancing Mr. Darcy, and finally the outgrowth of emoji as specific as  “Voynich ladies”  (a medieval image of naked women in a green spa, which denotes a rare and surprising luxurious experience, or alternately a conspiracy).<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>   Decorating a post with one or more emoji now operates as a language of digital gestures showing interest, comprehension, appreciation for the other’s presence, and (with greater intensity depending on the number or creativity of emoji) excitement or approbation for an idea. We lifted a number of reward animals from Asana, a project management tool we used early in the first grant project; when someone did not want to do a task, a common encouragement was to shout Think of the unicorns!<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  While we gradually abandoned Asana and returned to a more ad hoc and decentralized mode of task organization, we kept the part that still fit with the more horizontal and distributed way that we conceived of our work — namely, the reward animals.</p>
<p>Our most common emoji currently include this^,  100%, thumbs-up, smiles, frowns, and lovehearts, but many Slack users have individualized emoji that have come to represent them –– the boar, the two cats side by side, the frantically typing cat, the dancing party wizard. Many of these individualized emoji were created by Slack members or downloaded for the Slack, but others are default emoji that have taken on additional personal meaning in OBNS Slack. For example, King told the Slack a story about her parents’ home in Hawaii playing host to wild boars each winter, an unusual situation which elicited the heretofore little-used 🐗. Months later, she greeted the Slack with a tale of a bizarre situation on public transit (see Figure  8 below). Lockhart reacted with a small emoji platter, including 🐗, and declared that 🐗 now had an extra meaning, signifying  “incredible story that could only happen to @juliaking.”  Now regular news updates from King featuring less fantastical happenings still elicit 🐗, which has become personalized.</p>

</figure>
<p>The impact of these emoji is due to the affective work underlying them.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  As each lab member contributes a novel use of emoji, their in-the-moment play builds over time into a unique shared language. Kelly and Watts note that  “[i]n interaction design, effort is typically seen as something that should be minimised; the less work a user has to do, the better,”  but that in interpersonal relationships, effort can hold value, since  “invested effort can indicate caring towards others”   <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Accordingly, deploying a rarer emoji indicates special attention to the post thus decorated. Adding a new custom emoji to decorate the post indicates that something very important has been said and/or that a new need has been identified in the Slack. For instance, :eyestoothless:, an emoji of fierce, catlike staring eyes, made from a screen capture of Toothless the dragon in the first  <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>  film, is one example of Kelly and Watt’s relationally meaningful emoji. Originally added in December 2016 because of a need in #daily_cat, :eyestoothless: now represents unwavering attention and judgment in other contexts and is one of the most widely used and enduring emoji across the Slack. It subsequently took on a secondary significance within #daily_cat to refer to Akbari’s cat Bob, whom it resembles.</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As these examples show, the emoji moves between literal and figurative references, in which different details are salient. As a representation of the kitten’s fierceness, the first use draws on a reference to Toothless the dragon in the source film; elsewhere, in #daily_cat, this meaning is expanded to represent Bob even when he is not fierce due to a literal resemblance in colouring. For the joke on close reading in Figure 10, the second use draws on the intensity of the eyes, and on the community’s pre-existing association of the emoji with fierceness. It is the history of :eyestoothless: within the lab that makes it more appealing than the default 👀 emoji, which could also humorously indicate intense scrutiny of a text. The creative invention of new meanings over time, in itself, constitutes the value of these emoji. Our experience thus counters Ian Bogost’s general claim that  “emoji are becoming more specific and less flexible as more icons appear,”  with the result that  “[m]atching icons to words encourages fixity of meaning, especially as it becomes harder to find any single emoji by scrolling”   <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. On the contrary, the coining of additional emoji within the OBNS community has facilitated an exuberant proliferation of new meanings. This proliferation, in turn, has fuelled the interpersonal engagement of the OBNS lab members. While Kelly and Watts studied partnered relationships in their survey of  “relationally meaningful”  emoji usage, their findings nonetheless effectively describe the lab’s experience, highlighting the affective nature of the conversations occurring within this  “work”  space <sup id="fnref2:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The affective role of emoji production and use is also evident in the soft distinction between reactive and decorative emoji in the OBNS Slack. Reactive emoji express a direct emotional response to the affect of the post: a screaming face in response to a terrible story; a thumbs-up to express agreement; a loveheart to express adoration. By contrast, decorative emoji convey reader interest and understanding by representing the content or subject matter of the post in symbolic or literal form. Emoji reactions in OBNS Slack show the original poster that their post has been read by the community. In Figure  11 below, the emoji represent passages and themes from the Old English poem  <em>Beowulf</em>  as well as the autumnal day observed by Bolintineanu. Decorating a post with emoji in this way enables the reader to interact creatively with both the content of the post and its creator. The purpose is to delight or surprise the original poster by conveying a response beyond a conventional reaction. These reactions can be obvious referents (🍂 directly referring to my tree slowly losing its leaves), in-group referents (only Slack members familiar with  <em>Beowulf</em>  will recognize 🐉’s relevance to Beowulf lecture), obscure referents that may require explanation (🏺 representing the hoard of the last survivor), or purely symbolic or metaphorical responses (a night sky standing in for coldness, transience, death, an emotional response to  <em>Beowulf</em> , or any other feeling a reader might attribute to it). Decoration takes advantage of the range of emoji available in the Slack interface, a functionality that invites these kinds of surprise encounters.</p>

<p>As we have shown above, both channel structures and emoji usage developed over time in the OBNS environment, and both of these contributed substantially to the development of a community that is at once professional and personal, work-oriented and open to spontaneous play, intellectual and affective. While some channels were set up deliberately, geared toward a particular project’s needs or addressing a well-defined set of tasks (some time-limited, some ongoing), other channels emerged more organically in response to the needs and desires of the lab members. Similarly, emoji usage within the OBNS Slack serves not just a utilitarian function (e.g., 👍 signalling agreement with a plan of action) but also an affective one, building rapport both bilaterally and communally. Decorative emoji reactions, in particular, offer a kind of group communication distinct from other described emoji usage, by mirroring a member’s own message back to them visually to show that they are being heard. The coining of new emoji also signals an additional level of affective engagement, based on the time and effort devoted to the task. In the following section, we explore the economic circumstances that underlie the affective community, considering to what extent the virtual spaces of the OBNS Slack permit the growth of a horizontal network of interpersonal connection, and to what extent hierarchical structures persist within even this horizontal network. We then consider how the virtual spaces of the OBNS Slack community both work within and resist the economic imperatives of the university.</p>
<h2 id="affect-and-profit">Affect and Profit</h2>
<p>The OBNS lab is in many respects a horizontal community, with a strong sense of shared goals and responsibilities. The tone of the community has from the beginning been set by Gillespie, the lab’s founder and PI, who has established a work environment that seeks to enhance inclusivity and access and to model practices of care of self and of others that promote well being and personal growth.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  At the same time, however, it is undeniable that a vertical structure underlies the community, generated by the economic and administrative environment of the university workplace. Some regular OBNS members hold senior faculty positions, including chair or director roles, and are tenured; others hold faculty positions, but are untenured or pre-tenure; some have short-term hourly contracts following the completion of the PhD, while others inhabit staff positions prior to entering doctoral study or without the intention of entering a graduate program; others are current students whose income comes from a variety of sources which may include OBNS research grants. In the following pages, we consider how this paradoxical nature of the lab — both horizontal, in terms of shared tasks, workflow, and affective community; and vertical, in terms of economic and administrative structures — is expressed within the virtual space of OBNS Slack, and suggest that the dynamic character of those spaces might challenge the economic imperatives of the university.</p>
<p>Our assessment of the role of emoji runs counter to Luke Stark and Kate Crawford’s work highlighting the use of emoji in workplace communications <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. In  “The Conservatism of Emoji: Work, Affect, and Communication” , Stark and Crawford compile a history of emoji, particularly in the workplace, contextualized alongside phenomena like the original smiley face, emoticons, digital stickers, and reaction gifs. They describe an  “oscillating dynamic, whereby affect is captured by capital through proprietary cultural representations and subsequently escapes, only to be recaptured through new technocultural forms”   <sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Although new methods for the expression of emotion can initially provide a burst of affective liberation, Stark and Crawford write, the top-down technological insistence on conformity ultimately repurposes affective expression to serve the exploitative demands of capitalism. The restricted, standard forms of emoji ultimately foreclose individualized personal expression. Their examination of emoji in workplace communications focuses on the tendency for employers to demand an ultimately hollow performance of cheerful sociability from employees at work. At best, they argue,  “emoji are a prophylactic against the visceral traumas of what <a href="#gregg2010a">Melissa Gregg</a> terms the worker’s  schizophrenic and unpredictable encounter  with a culture of white-collar technical work characterized by a cynical, mediated sociality”   <sup id="fnref2:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Two interlinked aspects of the emoji usage in the OBNS Slack seem to depart from this grim picture in which  “the emancipatory potential of emoji is restricted by their industrial and commercial limitations”   <sup id="fnref3:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>: first, the flourishing of custom emoji created by and for OBNS members which allow individual expression without invigilation or regulation by any governing body or administrator; and, second, the intentional blurring of professional and personal interaction in order to prioritize the  <em>personal</em> .</p>
<p>Custom emoji inhabit a very special place within the overall landscape of the OBNS Slack.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  Scholars examining the history and use of emoji often draw attention to the unexpected role of the Unicode Consortium as a centralized authority dictating the emoji with which everyone may converse.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  However, custom emoji introduce the potential for personal creativity and expression. Standard emoji are used alongside custom emoji borrowed from other internet contexts, and those created by lab members specifically for lab use.</p>

        <p>July 11, 2017: A celebration of a completed dissertation, with a full emoji platter.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An example of our varied emoji vocabulary, including custom emoji, can be seen in Figure 12, which includes a congratulatory emoji “platter” in which multiple emoji are woven together to indicate a subtly nuanced feeling of praise. The platter opens with :party_parrot:, an animated, colour-changing emoji based on Sirocco, an internet-famous kakapo.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  Available as a free download for any Slack, :party_parrot: has many costumes, and, crucially, a slow frame rate that enables editing. (During one lab conference trip to Italy, Mitchell edited the default :party_parrot: to become :italian_parrot:, which flashed the colors of the Italian flag.) In this platter, default Slack emoji like 😍 and 🎉 mingle with custom emoji including :catamazed:, :asana_yeti:, :disco_darcy:, and :hwaet:. This last emoji is taken from the first word of the Old English  <em>Beowulf</em> , and is used as an exclamation of excitement, sometimes signalling a new beginning. The detailed and highly specific nature of these custom emoji, and the rich background and context that each of them carries, contributes meaningfully to the formation and maintenance of the community. Beyond this, however, the creation of a custom emoji is an act of affective labour. The process involves research, to locate suitable base images, and the application of technical skill, to modify them and upload them. The voluntary role of creator of custom emoji is a specialized one: three lab members (Laura Mitchell, Lawrence Evalyn, and Jessica Lockhart) have added 90% of the OBNS Slack’s custom emoji. All three describe emoji-creation as not just a procrastinatory amusement, but a public service: a new emoji contributes a new mode of expression for the group as a whole. Evalyn, in particular, cites emoji creation as a crucial personal connection while he was away from the physical lab space in Toronto and not part of any of the ongoing medieval projects. The labour of creating custom emoji is not insignificant: on the contrary, it serves as a kind of “gift” to the OBNS community that cements its affective bonds. The emotional labour devoted to the community surely results in common profit, as long as an ethic of self-reflection and openness continues to inform our work. But how is such labour to be accounted for, or compensated?</p>
<p>In considering the labour that is required to sustain the affective community — which, in turn, enables the professional productivity of the OBNS lab and its contributions to the university, both academic and economic — we must turn to the implied corporate setting that underlies usage of Slack. As in other workplace environments, Slack usage in OBNS is conducive to creating workflows in many ways, ranging from the punctual submission of timesheets by research assistants to the generation of proposals and reports for granting agencies. This quality, however, extends more broadly into the lives of lab members, embracing both professional and personal spheres. Such blurring existed from the outset: Slack was running constantly in the background while students were in class, staff members were in their office, and instructors were teaching, so that the overall shared project labour was consistently present and lab members were available via Slack for consultation even while other activities were underway. This meant that, whether we were working or not, we were connected to an online chat room filled with many of our closest peers, colleagues, and mentors. The #daily-check-in channel, with its bot-enforced demands for details, particularly emphasized the public display of to-do lists. It would be all too easy for the omnipresence of Slack to be a looming Panopticon, invigilating the participants to make sure that the appropriate measure of labour would be extracted from each one. OBNS Slack, however, has evolved as a very different digital environment, in a number of respects. Because of the plural nature of our digital spaces, engagement in a wide range of professional and personal modes is possible, while the fecundity of our emoji coinage and usage provides a way for community members to express care, whether self-directed or directed toward others.</p>
<p>The extent to which our space is one that resists the workplace’s demand for constant labour is evident in the kinds of things for which we hold ourselves accountable: not the constant completion of ever more tasks, but the self-protective measures of saying no, taking breaks, and acknowledging when we have done enough. This significantly contrasts with <a href="#bunce2018">Bunce&rsquo;s (2018)</a> ethnographic study of the IRIN (Integrated Regional Information Networks) News<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  newsroom as it adopted Slack as its primary mode of communication. Although the study’s authors describe Slack as encouraging collaboration and deepening relationships, they mean more effective professional relationships, rather than friendships. Perhaps as a result, users of the IRIN News Slack describe experiencing more negative impacts from always-on culture than in our Slack. Journalists describe working later than intended because they can see indicators that their coworkers are still online, feeling the need to compete with them; they also describe finding it difficult to step away from Slack, to accomplish needed work or to enjoy a break. They concluded that the infiltration of work into personal time was likely due to the strong role of managers in hierarchically directing the creation and use of the Slack, by creating channels and providing feedback to employees publicly. In the case of an academic work environment, where work schedules are often fluid and are not constrained to the 9 to 5 demands of an office, the always-on mentality has long been a feature of the profession.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  Perhaps because academics are used to a non-traditional work schedule, a horizontally collaborative space like Slack is less jarring for them than it would be for a traditional office worker. Overall, the newsroom offers an interesting contrast to our own experience of Slack, which reveals that increasing horizontal collaboration and fostering affective community are not the same.</p>
<p>In this respect, an environment of shared accountability in OBNS Slack promotes the sense of flattened hierarchies, a shared horizontal community. This is evident in the Slack channel now dedicated to this purpose, #accountability. This channel originally began in July 2018 as #votenow: lab founder Alexandra Gillespie, having found she was agreeing to do more things than she had time for, asked lab members to weigh in on individual requests for her service. For two months, the channel functioned as originally intended, with graduate students and other more junior lab members furnishing yeses, nos, or praise (for already having said no) as appropriate. However, at the end of September, one lab member (a recent PhD) chipped in with their own question, and soon after Gillespie asked the channel to ensure she completed a specific set of tasks by 10 a.m. the next day. The purpose of the channel had suddenly enlarged, and its usage accordingly boomed. The newly renamed #accountability immediately became popular, with several updates, requests, and jubilant reports of task completion within hours of being opened more widely. Six people joined on the first day, and at present nineteen members (~36% of the population of the Slack) now use the channel regularly for requests for sympathy, updates on task completion, grumbling, workshopping tasks, and co-working sprints. Accountability, in other words, is not simply understood as the employee’s obligation to the employer: on the contrary, it is understood as the obligation to take care of oneself and one another, in a horizontal framework of shared expectations and mutual support. Moreover, the use of the explicit task-setting channel, #daily-check-in, eventually collapsed in favour of the completely work-free daily channel, #daily_cat, as described above. These two examples emphasize how the OBNS lab has rejected Slack’s intended “productivity” and “efficiency” uses in favour of community building. Papapanagiotou (2018) observes the rise of social machines structuring an increasing proportion of human interactions, in which  “participants typically have limited autonomy to define and shape the machines they are part of”   <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. As part of their call for the development of decentralized participant-driven social machines, they note the danger in the fact that  “monolithic platforms provide useful services, but they stifle innovation, and enforce centralised notions of what sociality may or may not be”   <sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Our lab operates within Slack’s social machine, but we contend that nevertheless this is a freeing and creative experience for its users.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Looking back on OBNS Slack usage over time, and the ways in which the channels served as virtual rooms for our community, we see how the dynamic quality of our Slack is fundamental to its success and to the level of satisfaction experienced by its users. Initially, we organized and labelled our Slack channels to reflect the different aspects of the research project: discussions about conferences we were attending had an individual channel that was separate from the channel about publications we were producing, and we used the two Slack default channels, #general and #random, for their intended purpose. Team members could respond to messages in the assigned channel, through direct message, or by creating an emoji reaction to the message, and we made substantial use of all three methods of communication. However, we soon found that #random was insufficient for the amount of non-project-related conversation and collaboration that was taking place. We discovered that our use of Slack was growing in such a way that was, although unanticipated, one of the greatest benefits of the entire undertaking. In addition to the official designated channels we had put in place, other unrelated projects were beginning to spring up in private channels between team members. Team members worked on articles, organized guest lectures in one another’s classes, and applied for grants and funding. Slack became a valuable internal resource: those engaged in university teaching talked about the classes they were taking and teaching, while doctoral students talked about their dissertation research and writing, and members generally talked about how to navigate the various stages of graduate school and beyond. Because of the diversity of the team, with people at many different stages of their academic careers as well as PhDs who have taken non-academic career paths, there was a wide variety of experiences that the graduate students could draw upon. It is clear that Slack allowed all members of the OBNS team to get to know one another better and to create shared spaces for our geographically scattered team. OBNS Slack now exists for itself; we have overcome the limitations of physical space availability on our campus to create our own virtual social-professional space. In fact, team members, including some of the authors of this article, have moved across the country and abroad for other jobs and continue to be active within the non-project channels, which is an indication of how OBNS Slack has grown beyond its origin as a project management tool. The story we have told in this article is illustrative but not prescriptive: we recognize that different research and work communities will grow their Slack in other ways. If there is an exemplary quality in OBNS Slack, that quality lies in its organic, adaptive nature. The tension between the horizontal structure of our self-reflective affective community, and the vertical structure of the administrative and economic landscape that OBNS inhabits within the university, is a productive one. The virtual spaces of our OBNS Slack are not static, prefabricated rooms but (to use a metaphor) garden spaces, which grow and change over time, responding to changes within our community and in the world around us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are moved by things. And in being moved, we make things. An object can be affective by virtue of its own location (the object might be here, which is where I experience this or that affect) and the timing of its appearance (the object might be now, which is when I experience this or that affect). To experience an object as being affective or sensational is to be directed not only toward an object, but to whatever is around that object, which includes what is behind the object, the conditions of its arrival. What is around an object can become happy: for instance, if you receive something delightful in a certain place, then the place itself is invested with happiness, as being ‘what’ good feeling is directed toward. Or if you are given something by somebody whom you love, then the object itself acquires more affective value: just seeing something can make you think of another who gave you that something. If something is close to a happy object then it can become happy by association.<br>

<p>A key example here which we will revisit is <a href="#bunce2018">Bunce 2018</a>, a yearlong ethnographic study of Slack in a newsroom. They found that introducing Slack as a tool in the workplace enhanced communication efficiency and enabled new and better collaborative projects, but also eroded boundaries between personal and professional life by giving managers greater access to their employees, allowing professional expectations to intrude upon previously private time.

<p>For a description of a Slack community’s purposeful enforcement of distinctive channels, see <a href="#melv%C3%A6r2017">Melvær (2017)</a>. Of their practice of regulating channel separation, Melvær writes,  “We have adopted the Slack’s 🦝 strategy of redirecting discussions to their respective channels. This is to reduce channel noise, but also for purposes of finding the discussion later. It can be useful to start the redirection with a link posted to OP message, to create a cross reference.”&#160;<a href="#fnref:10" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>These channel names refer to different parts of the Digital Tools for Manuscript Study project. #digitaltoolsmss was for general project discourse, #canterburytales for the portion of the project focused on collating the  <em>Canterbury Tales</em>  for use with VisColl, and #stow for the portion of the project that used the annotations of English antiquarian John Stow (1524/5-1605) as a use case for development of an Omeka plug-in.&#160;<a href="#fnref:12" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>It is notable that although we stuck to business-like channel formats for six months, a relatively long time in the lifetime of the Slack, channels like #general and #daily-check-in contained messages that mixed the professional and the personal before the adoption of #daily_cat.

<p>In early 2017, private channels were used for a few projects that required external collaboration from people who were not full members of the Slack; after these were completed, private conversations shifted to DMs. Slack’s pricing model charged by the number of full members, and for external collaborators who functionally only needed to be in one channel, we took advantage of the single-channel guest membership option, which was free. The switch to DM occurred, practically, because the OBNS team was able to get educational pricing approval from Slack — and thus was no longer paying for members active in public channels. However, some lab members, including Gillespie, began work on projects early in 2017 and collaborated via DM with one or two members of the lab. Other spikes in DM activity occurred around the time of the 2018 NCS Congress, when members of the lab served as conference management and volunteer support, and contacted each other via Slack DM rather than text message.&#160;<a href="#fnref:15" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Ross uses Slack as a professor teaching undergraduate courses in marketing. Although the context of a class, in which students are evaluated by a central instructor for a grade, creates a hierarchical environment, one of Ross’s findings is that  “students felt that Slack transformed the course into a team-like atmosphere, reducing the monolithic feel of the instructor–student relationship and transforming the content into one that felt more student-centric, collaborative, and egalitarian”   <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:17" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>A major difference between a two-person text conversation and a group chat in Slack has to do with the position of emoji in the conversational tempo. Two people texting are in a pattern of constant back and forth, where one person is always in the position of needing to respond to the other; in a texting app, emoji can only be sent in or as text messages. Sending an emoji in a text to one’s partner just means saying that image to them in the moment. In a group chat, however, there is no sense of whose conversational turn it is at any given moment, since anyone can respond. Moreover, in addition to allowing emoji to be sent in or as messages within the conversational flow, Slack also has a feature for emoji reactions to be attached to other people’s messages. These reaction emoji provide a response to someone’s statements without interrupting them, or without reviving the whole conversation if the main flow of discussion has moved on. As a result, rather than keeping a conversation going without words, as <a href="#kelly2015">Kelly (2015)</a> describes in text conversations, we argue, emoji reactions in Slack provide a backchannel that gets outside the conversation to build a more general sense of an activated social space.&#160;<a href="#fnref:26" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

In addition to a final researched paper, an oral defense, and a digital portfolio, the degree requires 48 credits of coursework; eight of these are fulfilled working at Ooligan Press, though many students elect to invest much more time than that.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  At a cultural moment when some R-1 digital humanities and book history programs are exploring the materiality of moveable type letterpresses, such as the Book Lab at University of Maryland, Huskiana Press at Northeastern University, and the Rutgers Initiative for the Book,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  book materiality at Portland State, a Carnegie-classified R-2, is commercially oriented because the press needs proceeds from book sales in order to survive.</p>
<p>Ooligan Press sells the books it makes because sales sustain the student experience of learning how to make books from start-to-finish: from title acquisition through developmental and copyediting, book cover design and interior design, marketing, ebook conversion, social media and events-based launch, and backlist management. Book sales are also a test of how accurately the student teams have gauged the market for the manuscript they acquired and made into a book. From 2015 to 2019, Ooligan Press was 27% profitable. That number encompasses the most recent seventeen titles published over five years, generating $124,993 in gross revenue and netting $33,206 in profit. Profits are reinvested back into the material costs of the press. As of 2015 to 2019, six of the seventeen titles are currently unprofitable; all of these were published prior to 2018, a 65% by-title profitability.  “The press is getting better at predicting success, but it takes a long time to see that in actual development because of the long timelines of publishing,”  notes former Ooligan Publisher and article co-author Abbey Gaterud.  “If Ooligan had a sequence of bad books (or rising expenses) we&rsquo;d be in trouble. There&rsquo;s no safety net.”</p>
<p>There’s no safety net might be the motto of Ooligan Press. It dovetails with the scarce resources and the accessibility mission of Portland State as an R-2, which is charged to Let Knowledge Serve the City: a core value so foundational to PSU that it’s inscribed in gold letters across a bridge spanning a main thoroughfare of our urban campus. Ooligan’s role in Portland’s thriving independent publishing scene is led by its ethical commitment to stewardship and community outreach. Initiatives such as  <em>Rethinking Paper and Ink</em> , a sustainability guide to critically examine the book publishing industry; Writers of Color Spring Showcase, an annual event where local authors meet agents and publishers; Write to Publish, a one-day conference that demystifies publishing for aspiring authors; and Transmit Culture, a free and open-to-the-public quarterly lecture series about book publishing, all do the work of delivering accessible publishing information to broader, local publics.</p>
<p>At points in its nineteen-year history, Ooligan has been on the verge of shutdown. That Ooligan is now slightly budget-positive accomplishes some goals digital humanists rarely talk about in the context of labs: how can practitioners outside of R-1s afford to build a lab? How to connect the lab’s output holistically to the communities it serves? What’s the role of a lab in helping students achieve learning outcomes they seek when they enroll in a degree program? These questions, centered on students and community impact, are often not within the ambit of R-1 labs. And yet they are a vital component of postgraduate DH training that merit attention and support.</p>
<p>DH at an R-2 is expressly tied to teaching and learning. At Ooligan, feminist pedagogy manifests itself in horizontal structures of power and built-in managerial overlaps in student responsibilities. We foster an ethic of care and mutual dependence. This ethic of care might be why Ooligan persisted despite funding calamities a decade ago, when it was on the verge of collapse. Today, the press’s acquisitions editors do extensive forecasting, including profit-and-loss projections based on sales data available for comp (comparable or comparator) titles. This forecasting allows Ooligan to guess more accurately which people, and how many, will buy its books, sales necessary to recoup the significant investment in printing. Printing costs are not a budget line item funded by Portland State University. Being self-sustaining shields Ooligan from the boom-bust cycles that can beset DH centers and labs, where there’s top-down money for startup but rarely for maintenance <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. As Ooligan Press has become more successful at making books people want to buy, the lab has expanded its capacity, adding ebooks (in 2012) and audiobooks (in 2018) to the slate of digital objects that book publishing master’s students can learn how to make.</p>
<p>In this R-2 DH lab, students decide which projects to develop, and which skills they want to learn and master as a byproduct of their labor. More traditional labs orient graduate students to objects of study or critical making that have been decided by faculty and/or lab directors. Ooligan Press vests even freshly-admitted newcomers with the same authority to speak in meetings and direct the goals of the press as more experienced students and faculty. This feminist principle is aligned with similar organizational efforts documented in panels like  “Feminist Infrastructures”  at the Allied Digital Humanities Organization’s 2016 conference in Kraków, and the  “Feminist Infrastructures and Technocultures”  assembly at the University of California San Diego in 2013. It aligns historically with second-wave feminist social organizational practices, where women formed collectives and made books like  <em>Our Bodies, Ourselves</em> , originally published in 1970 by the Boston Women’s Health Collective. It is a feminist principle that context and participants’ lived experience should factor into calibrations of value.</p>
<p>As DH field survey moves from the  “big tent”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> to the  “expanded field”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> ( <em>pace</em>   <a href="#krauss1979">Krauss 1979</a>) to, most recently, micro-domains where work  “is not always fully legible to those not versed in the particular methods or conversations taking place in that domain”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, we articulate Ooligan Press specifically as a digital humanities lab. The implied prestige of digital humanities has little impact on perceptions of Ooligan Press. Ooligan gains nothing particular from being recognized as DH. But DH has something to gain from locating a lab like Ooligan Press within its domain because as the field now includes R-2s, SLACs, small private universities, and community colleges, the field will benefit from developing nomenclature to describe how DH is practiced without the budgets, resources, and priorities of R-1s. A dearth of scholarly information about non-R-1 DH can be attributed to the lack of time and research money teaching faculty typically have to support writing and conferencing.</p>
<p>In their introduction to  <em>Debates in Digital Humanities 2019</em> , Gold and Klein call for  “work that exposes the impact of our embededness in [social, political and technical] systems and that brings our technical expertise to bear on the societal problems those systems sustain”   <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Here’s a problem: how to make DH available to students at a chronically underfunded regional comprehensive university — students who are the most likely to have experienced the alienating effects of poverty, racism, sexism, ageism and homo- and transphobia? How to reveal the assumptions and ideologies expressed in off the shelf,  frictionless software products made by Adobe, Google, Microsoft and Apple — not to mention the social media platforms marketing teams work in to launch books — if not by studying them using DH methods and tools? Our solution in the book publishing graduate program has been to integrate a technically intensive business as part of the curriculum and to give students actual power to perform work at every point in the book communication circuit <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Rather than the hierarchies of a traditional DH lab, where the most senior people retain the privilege of writing interpretive essays about lab findings <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, Ooligan Press students benefit directly and immediately from their own labor, in ways discussed below.</p>
<p>Some readers of this essay may disagree with the designation of Ooligan Press as a DH lab because its output is commercial print product, not a boutique tool or dataset. Such a position is understandable, but unwarranted. Technical engagement with Silicon Valley products does not stop or disincentivize students from performing critique of those tools and technical systems. Required coursework in the book publishing program introduces students to creative coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript; text analysis; media theory; media archeology; and cultural studies in those contexts. This, coupled with required coursework in research methods, broadens the range of questions students ask about book publishing and equips them with scholarly training to answer them. In this essay we trace how Ooligan Press is intersectional in the lab’s human processes and in its nonhuman technical and commercial systems. In doing so, we are mindful of work by Tara McPherson, Miriam Posner and Julia Flanders, which framed for us, as Flanders puts it,  “the difficulty . . . in creating a single coherent account of the operations of diversity in theories about how ‘building’ operates in digital humanities.” <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  Ooligan Press stands apart from the prestige economy stoked by  “colonial and masculinist lineages”  of  “inherited lab models”  that  “can have direct influence not only on the types of projects taken up by a lab, but on its overall ethos”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The M.E.A.L.S. framework developed by Elizabeth Losh and Jacqueline Wernimont (2018) organizes the following case study of Ooligan Press: Materiality, Embodiment, Affect, Labor and Situatedness. We locate Ooligan Press in the lived reality of our students of all genders, most of whom work part-time jobs while also staffing the press, taking a full academic course load, interning at local Portland-area small presses, and — some of them — raising families. In doing so, we underscore the Value of inclusivity. (Losh and Wernimont added Values to the M.E.A.L.S. matrix in their introduction to  <em>Bodies of Information</em> .) We three authors of this article, the full-time faculty in the PSU Book Publishing program, value the digital labor of Ooligan graduate students and offer this essay as documentation to join the work of recuperating women’s  “invisible labor”  in technical settings <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Such elisions might historically have been justified by declaring women’s contributions to be merely technical, not analytic.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  Today’s variant on that diminution might be that the women’s technical proficiency is commercial, not metacritical when held to the standard of making boutique tools. The book publishing industry is between 74-80% cis-female <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>, and Ooligan Press’s students proportionally matriculate more female, nonbinary and/or and queer than the publishing industry norm. We hope this essay will help others think through how the humanities’ interrogative stance takes shape in the applied context of a book publishing program that sells books to survive and is run in accord with feminist principles of power.</p>
<h2 id="ooligan-press-within-book-publishing-studies">Ooligan Press Within Book Publishing Studies</h2>
<p>Book publishing master’s programs are positioned within various departments. The location of PSU’s book publishing program within the English department on the one hand seems like a natural extension of the study of literature, but on the other like a strange marriage of humanities and social sciences. Indeed, scholars who research within the academic discipline of book publishing often draw from concepts and methodologies that are associated with sociology (such as <a href="#bourdieu1993">Bourdieu 1993</a>, <a href="#thompson2012">Thompson 2012</a>). It’s possible that one factor in the prevalence of sociological methods in book publishing is due to an effort to distinguish book publishing from literary analysis of the text itself. However, book publishing is very much a  <em>humanist</em>  endeavor because while both humanities and social sciences have human subjects, relationships, and interactions as crucial to the research and fields, the primary difference between humanities and social sciences is method — qualitative vs quantitative, philosophical vs scientific. For this reason, book publishing might be called applied humanities, which demonstrates the pairing of conceptual and theoretical knowledge with practical application that typifies book publishing degree programs. Book publishing has a vocational tie in the same way that business schools, engineering departments, and other social and natural science fields prepare their students for work in the world. However, much like these other fields, book publishing is not  <em>only</em>  vocational.</p>
<p>Only four other teaching presses exist, and all four of them are fairly recent initiatives, without the infrastructure, institutional history, and integration that are central to Ooligan Press. Bowen Street Press is part of the publishing master’s program at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia (established in 1988), which houses the oldest publishing program in Australia <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Bowen Street Press is student-run, founded in 2016, and publishes primarily anthologies, zines, and magazines. Lamplight Press is the only student-run press as part of a publishing program in the UK, at Loughborough University, but Lamplight Press is for undergraduate students, not graduate students. Lamplight previously published 4 books a year, was self-distributed, and was founded in 2013, but it hasn’t been since 2015 that anything has been published at the press, presumably in part because the faculty member who founded and championed the press moved to a position at another university. The third example of book publishing teaching presses is New Rivers Press, based at Minnesota State University Moorhead. This press is not integrated with a book publishing program; however, it is a student-run publishing company, with distribution through Small Press Distribution, a trade book distributor that does not have the national reach that large distributors like Ingram do. The fourth example is Lookout Books, launched in 2011, a literary book publishing press located within the Department of Creative Writing at University of North Carolina Wilmington; students work in the press as part of coursework for a BFA certificate in Publishing. Lookout Books is distributed by Consortium (owned by Ingram). Of these four teaching presses, Lookout Books and Bowen Street Press are the ones that come closest to the kind of teaching press experience and output that Ooligan Press provides, but even that is a far cry from the national distribution, varied output, integrated systems, and longevity that characterize Ooligan.</p>
<p>Book publishing programs assess student knowledge and prepare students for work in the publishing industry through individual book projects. This often entails a student taking a book through the various stages of the publication process (editing, marketing, design) and finally culminating in a printed and bound (or digital) product. This corresponds generally with a publishing program guiding and instructing students through the various aspects, agents, and processes within the book publishing workflow, value chain, or communications circuit [<a href="#darnton2007">Darnton 2007</a>, <a href="#squires2013">Squires and Murray 2013</a>]. Examples of programs that integrate final book projects include Drexel University, Emerson College, New York University, University of Stirling, University of Sydney, University of Central Lancashire, and Kingston University. Other programs utilize the publication of a student-run journal as the collaborative book project that culminates or at least contributes to the book publishing master’s degree experience. Examples of such programs include National University of Ireland Galway, Simon Fraser University, and University College London.</p>
<p>However, neither of these culminating experiences (student-run journals or individual student-produced book projects) replicate the chaos, uncertainty, and changing nature of the industry. In other words, these hypothetical publishing scenarios and individual projects offer a small window into what publishing is and what publishing professionals do, but it’s only through a lab like Ooligan Press, with real time and money constraints and a constant influx of new problems to solve, that students gain and practice the problem solving, critical thinking, and reflection skills that are necessary in book publishing.</p>
<h2 id="materiality">Materiality</h2>
<p>Ooligan Press became a structured entity through a set of accidents and precarities: backdoor founding by a non-tenure track English department faculty member; little funding; grandfathered-in national distribution; and lab integration into the curriculum only because there developed a one-credit gap between graduate class credit hours (two classes = 8 credits) and the nine-credit minimum to qualify for loans and financial aid. These contingencies made Ooligan Press possible to exist, and shape its present-day characteristics. Such serendipity makes the press difficult to replicate in a top-down DH lab model. A bottom-up approach rife with contingencies led to Ooligan’s success.</p>
<p>It is the core belief at Ooligan Press that students own the press. Being a student at Ooligan is to be responsible for the editorial direction of the press and the success or failure of the books we publish. Founded in 2001 alongside the master’s in publishing program at Portland State University, Ooligan Press is staffed by one full-time non-tenure-track professor (the Publisher) and a rotating cohort of approximately sixty students. The two other faculty in the program, Berens and Noorda, advise the press.</p>
<p>Distribution services from Ingram Publishing Group give Ooligan’s books access to the same retail outlets and opportunities as major publishers like Taunton Press, Indiana University Press, and Granta Books. Without this access, Ooligan would be unable to sell the books it produces beyond what personal outreach to retail outlets could net, and would make its operations unsustainable. Through a connection with a community advisor, who was also the publisher of a local company called Graphic Arts Books, Ooligan found a new distributor through Graphic Arts. About a year after solidifying this relationship, Graphic Arts was partially sold to Ingram Publisher Services and Ooligan found itself lucky enough to be brought in under Graphic Arts’ wing.</p>
<p>This development turned out to be one of the best in Ooligan’s history: with the guidance of IPS’s experienced sales reps and with the clout of the Ingram name behind them, the books produced after this partnership quickly became more successful than any of Ooligan’s previous titles. Without a personal connection between two publishers, Ooligan would have struggled to convince such a large, nationally known entity to take it on as a client. Producing only three or four titles a year, Ooligan’s output would not be large enough to entice a major distributor. But Ooligan’s placement with Graphic Arts, combined with its singularity in publishing education, allows the relationship to be successful.</p>
<p>As the press operations have matured over time, so have the digital tools used on a daily basis to improve communication, keep records, produce books, and maintain history. Adoption of these tools has been, like most things at Ooligan, organic. Early in the press’s history, Apple iMacs were procured and local licenses for Adobe Creative Suite products like InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat were installed to assist with print book production. These tools were purchased with one-time infusions of tech money from either the Dean’s office or the University’s Office of Information Technology. As ebook production entered the press’s operational scope, these tools, combined with other free programs like Sigil, BbEdit, Wordpress, and Kindle Previewer, were repurposed to make digital books.</p>
<p>Project management tools have been used since the beginning, but have become more integrated and sophisticated as freely available, high-quality digital tools have appeared on the market. Ooligan adopted the Google Suite of products in 2009 and quickly integrated the full function of Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets. Prior to this adoption, most production scheduling was handled by Microsoft Excel files shared on a PSU server space, leading to versioning problems and clunky access points. The Google Suite erased those issues, but brought new challenges of document ownership transfer, overwhelming numbers of documents, and difficulties in shared organization of files. To combat these problems, digital content managers in 2012 proposed adoption of Trello, a cloud-based and free project management software. Rolled out over the summer of 2013, the smooth operation of the press quickly became reliant on Trello’s kanban-board structure. Based on a standardized template board, project managers and Publisher construct a new board for each project after its author contract is signed, customizing it for the new project’s timeline and intricacies.</p>
<p>While book project managers are responsible for the life cycle of a book from contract signing to post-publication publicity, department managers — another group of second-year graduate students — are responsible for the quality of work in the more traditional division of labor. These managers work with project managers and team members on specific parts of the book’s life cycle, ensuring professional-level quality in the books. These redundant layers of management serve as a backstop against shoddy work and also against the problem of relying too heavily on one person to carry the burden of an entire project. Managers are often taking the four-credit Publishing Studio course, therefore ensuring more time in their course schedule to devote to Ooligan work; but they are also taking other courses, and often working off-campus jobs, raising families, doing internships, and simply living messy human lives. Ooligan’s structure allows students the space to be developing humans, sometimes needing a day or two off, while also ensuring that the work can continue. If a student does need to take time off from school for any reason, the book and author do not suffer in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="embodiment">Embodiment</h2>
<p>Ooligan is an experiential learning practicum where metacognitive reflection loops the practicum’s applied learning into academic coursework <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and where academic coursework contextualizes the use of digital tools by providing theoretical and cultural frameworks for understanding their situatedness in commercial and other systems. Students present weekly project updates at press-wide meetings, teach domain-specific lessons, write midterms and final papers, and gather exemplary work they&rsquo;ve made in digital portfolios. These academic outputs are one form of value at Ooligan; another is the hands-on contribution Ooligan Press books make to Pacific Northwest culture. Ooligan’s mission recognizes  “the importance of comprehensive representation and diversity, particularly within the publishing industry, and [is] committed to building a literary community that includes traditionally underserved voices.”  Ooligan encourages submission of  “works originating from, or focusing on, the experiences that come from these people and communities within the Pacific Northwest.”</p>
<p>Students can, and usually do, take Ooligan coursework each term — WR574 Publishing Studio for four credits or WR575 Publishing Lab for one credit — including some summer-term coursework. This allows students to engage long-term with the books being published at Ooligan and also allows for two years of technical and problem-solving skills development. Students report that this long-term, in-depth involvement with book projects is one of the biggest benefits of PSU’s program: they iterate skills and build mastery that could not be developed over the course of one term in a more traditional classroom-project setting.</p>
<p>Since the press operates within the structure of a classroom but also outside of it, it has developed its current structure organically to deal with the unique challenges of running a business within a classroom. For example, the first Ooligan cohort had eight students; all students worked collaboratively on all aspects of the book production process, mostly in dedicated classroom face-to-face settings. Over time as the number of involved students increased, the organizational structure evolved to one that emulates that of the wider publishing industry, with departments structured around the main divisions of labor: editorial, design, marketing and sales.</p>

<p>As Ooligan grew in number of students and number of titles published, this structure evolved, with a switch to a project-based approach rolled out in 2011. The reasons for this shift were two-fold. One, students were given a broader understanding of the full process that a book goes through inside a publishing house, which came from curricular needs. The publishing program aims to give students a broad understanding of all aspects of the publishing process, and faculty found that students tended to silo their work and their exposure to areas where they felt most comfortable. To increase exposure to new and emerging fields in publishing — like digital content production and marketing — required students to work with an entire book rather than a department. Gradually their work would encompass all aspects of book production, thereby making their understanding of the process deeper and broader.</p>
<p>The second reason for a shift to project-based teams was as an effort to overcome the biggest hurdle at Ooligan: institutional memory. As one cohort of managers graduates from the program, the next one steps in over the summer term and takes full control of their project or department. The Publisher trains new managers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run meetings effectively</li>
<li>Use the tools of production management (Trello, Google suite)</li>
<li>Evaluate the production schedule over one term, and also the school year</li>
<li>Apportion work assignments to team members based not only on what needs to get done, but also on the amount of time the team member has allocated to Ooligan work based on their enrollment in Studio or Lab</li>
<li>Manage interpersonal communication issues</li>
<li>Discern when to reach out to management colleagues or the publisher for help.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the work of the press is diffuse, spread among many teams, the need for a central organizing figure in the form of the Publisher became apparent. The Publisher serves as the instructor of record for Publishing Studio and Publishing Lab (plus one other graduate-level course per term) and the administrator of business matters relating to outside vendors, internal stakeholders, and community outreach. She also serves as the mentor to every student working within the press.</p>
<p>The work of Ooligan Press happens both in the classroom and outside of it. Twice a week for two hours, the class meets in various formats. The first hour (of the weekly four) is spent at the Ooligan Executive meeting, where all students working at the press meet and hear reports from managers and the Publisher about production schedules, weekly assignments, and departmental progress. Then for hour two, each project team meets to get new assignments, discuss work-in-progress, and troubleshoot. The work is collaborative, but also individual, with more advanced students taking on more responsibility and often serving as mentors and one-on-one collaborators to incoming students unfamiliar with the work or process. Managers grade their individual team members according to an established rubric.</p>
<h2 id="affect">Affect</h2>
<p>The success or failure of a book heightens the stakes for student work in a real, tangible way. When a book is successful, a student can claim as much reward and pride in it as the author themselves. When  <em>Blue Thread</em>  by Ruth Tenzer Feldman won the Oregon Book Award for young adult literature in 2012, a dozen students and faculty were in the auditorium and erupted in cheers when the winner was announced. The same scene played itself out again in 2017 when Eliot Treichel’s  <em>A Series of Small Maneuvers</em>  won the Oregon Book Award Reader’s Choice award. Students who have worked on a title can find their names published in the back of every Ooligan book on an Ooligan Credits page, cementing themselves in the book and author’s life long after they have graduated.</p>
<p>But when a hurdle is encountered or a mistake made, the real-world, human consequences are also felt at a deeper level. A project manager in 2017, after discovering a major omission in an already printed book, reacted with tears — and then a plan to address the omission — in a private meeting with then-Publisher Gaterud, and then a tearful confession to the press at the weekly meeting. A student in 2018, after leading the press to acquire a book that she had first heard informally pitched at a writer’s conference, told Gaterud that she’d never been prouder of herself in an educational setting. The stakes are real and the reactions are as well, something prospective students understand as much as graduates. Fifty percent of recent graduates cite the opportunity for hands-on experience at Ooligan Press to be the deciding factor in attending PSU, far more than location (16%), career prospects (15%), and even cost (6%).</p>
<p>Publishing is a process such that each book can be conceptualized as a  “startup”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> and those entrepreneurial competencies of tolerance of ambiguity, flexibility, and curiosity are all essential in real-world publishing. How to equip students with these entrepreneurial competencies? Experiential learning, like the student work at Ooligan Press, is a prominent approach in entrepreneurship education in the U.S. <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> and helps to develop self-regulated learning, where students are proactive in seeking information and mastering skills necessary to tackle a particular problem <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="labor">Labor</h2>
<p>Overwork and passion for that work are material contexts for the students and the three full-time book publishing faculty who co-authored this article. Office hours bleed into weekends, evenings, phone calls during our commutes to accommodate our students’ overstuffed work schedules. In thinking about the sustainability of a not-for-profit press and of ourselves, we invoke DH work on capacity, care and codework by [<a href="#nowviskie2015">Bethany Nowviskie 2015</a>, <a href="#barnett2014">Fiona Barnett 2014</a>, <a href="#klein2015">Lauren Klein 2015</a>], and the many women in our networks whose overwork “for love” greases the DH gears. We book pub faculty collectively decided upon the necessity of making our invisible faculty labor infrastructurally visible and supported. In 2018, we revised the curriculum to require all students to take a research methods class; previously, training in research methods was conducted under the auspices of advising, which meant extensive office hours and emails outside of coursework. In 2020, we revised the curriculum again to permit students to repeat the research class because students were requesting independent studies to seek additional mentoring and time for research; Portland State does not pay faculty to offer independent studies.</p>
<p>The book publishing program can offer graduate assistantships to only a small portion of the incoming class, which in turn impacts how many of our students take extra jobs and loans to earn their degrees. Personal financial risk is another messy condition that can’t be neatly excised from questions of labor, affect, and even embodiment: these bodies and minds can become depleted, particularly in the second year when management responsibilities at the press compound the pressures of a full course load and extra-academic jobs that pay the bills.</p>
<p>It’s unconventional in DH scholarship to valorize post-graduate employability, but at our R-2 where students typically fund their own degrees, it’s a vital context. We consider it ethical to insist, in a moment of pervasive and debilitating student debt, that employability is a relevant dimension of the training our program provides.</p>
<ul>
<li>88% of Oolies secure employment within six months of graduation that allows them to  “use their publishing skills in a meaningful way.”</li>
<li>76% find such work within three months of graduation,</li>
<li>35% find such work within thirty days of graduation.</li>
<li>73% of alumni report that connections made while students in Portland’s independent publishing scene helped them land those first jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>But employability is just one piece of the picture. The applied work of making books refines intellectual inquiry and research. Original research using data, thematic coding, and cultural studies features in 46 student essays published open access using the BePress tool via the Portland State University PDXScholar repository. At time of writing, more than 10,000 copies of student research have been downloaded. This itself is a significant contribution to book publishing studies and digital humanities.</p>

<h2 id="situatedness">Situatedness</h2>
<p>Book publishing master’s candidates aren’t just classmates; they’re also colleagues running and managing a business in an industry that runs on relationships and sells objects that are very expensive to fix if something goes wrong. Printed books cannot be easily changed, adapted, or modified once they have been solidified into a print object. A second edition might come out once the print run has been exhausted (this has happened only once in Ooligan’s nineteen-year history); otherwise, the print object is a fixed thing. Print’s fixity adds pressure and risk to the process. If the design of the cover is off by half an inch, then the entire print run includes covers that don’t line up with the spine. If there is a major editorial oversight in a chapter, that oversight appears in every copy of the print run. It’s a real-world scenario in which the stakes are high in economic, social, and symbolic terms. This fixed, one-shot opportunity to get the final product right affectively influences all those involved in the press in a way that would be difficult to replicate without Ooligan’s real-world uncertainties, and the pressure of knowing that Ooligan must remain budget-neutral in order to survive.</p>
<p>The love of books first brings students together in the graduate program; loyalty, trust, understanding, and mutual dependence prompts the students to tattoo their bodies with the Ooligan Press logo, start new presses and freelance agencies together, engage in a myriad of personal and extracurricular activities together, and put in extra time and effort (particularly for press managers) to develop a sense of community and deep relationships. 98% of our graduates stay connected to the book publishing program via our mailing list and through our Facebook group (a private group is not limited exclusively to alumni). In an alumni survey, 70% of respondents said they felt connected to the graduate program in book publishing, in contrast to only 12% who felt connected to the English department in which book publishing is housed and 30% who felt connected to PSU as a whole. This sense of community, facilitated largely by Ooligan Press, contributes to why 91% of book publishing alumni feel that the graduate degree was a good investment of their time and money <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-applied-humanities">Conclusion: Applied Humanities</h2>
<p>Ooligan Press gives book publishing master’s program students digital humanities lab experience that trains them ethically, technically and emotionally in time-pressured and constrained real-world settings. Publishing books that the public buys is an extra-academic context in which to measure technical skills and rising confidence. Steven Lubar, the public humanist at Brown University asks:  “How do the humanities change when we take engaged public scholarship seriously?”  Rather than a plea for the more conservative, less socially engaged work Erwin Steinberg called for in his 1974 article  “Applied Humanities” , we think applied humanities is a term that modifies digital humanities in a useful way, by suggesting that humanities work is always situated in particular communities who are served–or not–by that work.</p>
<p>There are two salient aspects of Ooligan Press as a digital humanities lab that this essay has contextualized. The first is Ooligan as a not-for-profit business that sustains experiential learning and extends digital humanities pedagogical approaches beyond R-1s. The second is feminism, and an ethic of care that makes space for student autonomy and press ownership.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2016, the University of Utah launched the Digital Matters Lab<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  within a temporary pop-up space in the Marriott Library. However tenuous, it was nevertheless the culmination of eighteen months of meetings and policy writing sessions, and represented the first step toward future plans to build a permanent home — a 3,000 square foot lab complete with virtual reality studio, 3D printing, collaborative workspace, and classrooms. But the ghost of failure haunted these conversations, for this was the University of Utah’s second attempt to build a Digital Humanities (or, depending on discipline, Digital Scholarship) lab. Reminders of efforts past emerged in unexpected ways throughout the process. For example, the Digital Matters exploratory working group discovered early on that we had a predecessor. A small group of librarians had led a similar group several years before, yet we had no record or knowledge of their efforts, accomplishments, and missteps. The challenge was two-fold: how could we track down the lessons learned from our first attempt if little institutional memory remained, and how could we persuade hesitant stakeholders that a second attempt would be worthwhile?</p>
<p>This paper outlines the process through which we formed the Digital Matters Lab at the University of Utah in the face of the aforementioned challenges, and the factors that contributed to its launch. First, we recognized that the compulsion to bridge the humanities and arts with technology and computing was, is, and always will be, present on campus, albeit in unfocused and disparate forms. Regardless of whether the university pursued a DH initiative or not, these efforts would persist; and by dedicating a space, funds, and personnel to the Digital Matters Lab, the university would coalesce these efforts under a singular identity and focus. Second, due to a confluence of elements that we later describe in detail, several colleges — led by the Marriott Library — came together to agree to a cost-sharing scheme mitigating risk and easing financial burden. And third, Digital Matters staff agreed that the lab’s focus and mission would be grounded in critical scholarship and engage locally with projects of significance to Utah and the broader Mountain West region. Building on that mission, we adopted a four year theme of sustainability, which allowed us to think through concerns about digital humanities itself while also casting an eye toward our specific environmental challenges in Utah. Most importantly, we embraced the legacy of failure and adopted a skeptical framework to guide our approach. That is, we recognized ongoing campus DH research and avoided hyperbolic promises of the new, eagerly collaborated both within and outside of the four partner colleges, and constantly refined the DML&rsquo;s identity and mission to reflect local interests and character.</p>
<h2 id="digital-humanities-in-libraries-three-subgenres">Digital Humanities in Libraries: Three Subgenres</h2>
<p>Creating a library-based digital humanities center is a now well-worn path of both success and struggle ( “Registry of DH sites with library participation” , 2018). Though several early digital humanities centers started in English departments, in recent decades there has been a migration to library-based models that range from a  “virtual suite of services”  to full-fledged digital humanities centers <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There are distinct advantages in placing DH centers in libraries. Libraries provide an inherently interdisciplinary space where faculty from across campus feel comfortable taking advantage of technology and services. Libraries have high-traffic physical spaces, technical infrastructure (server space, software, collections), and human expertise (metadata, copyright, data management, digital preservation, project management) that are potentially beneficial to digital humanities efforts. Many high-profile digital scholarship and digital humanities efforts are based in libraries such as HathiTrust at the University of Michigan Library, the Women Writers Project at Northeastern University Library, Chronicling America at the Library of Congress, and countless digital archives. Moreover, as libraries evolve from sites of knowledge circulation to knowledge production, an intimate relationship with a DH center is strategically and mutually beneficial <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite a natural fit, in practice the majority of libraries tend to offer DH services in an ad hoc manner with many libraries struggling to find an optimal approach for DH engagement <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Digital humanities in a library might be subsumed under a broader category of digital scholarship, digital publishing, digital library, or data management. Often there is a single librarian responsible for supporting or leading digital humanities efforts in addition to their core job duties.</p>
<p>These issues are well-documented in a growing body of DH+Lib literature, which we see as consisting of three subgenres. The first chronicles strategies for building a DS/DH center or lab in resource-challenged environments. A. Miller, in  “DH Start-Ups: A Library Model for Advancing Scholarship through Collaboration” , details how Middle Tennessee State University&rsquo;s library was able to establish its Digital Scholarship lab in its library by forming strategic partnerships, co-opting faculty lines, and narrowing its mission and scope <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Articles such as these are useful for visualizing the processes and steps required to formulate a digital humanities lab, particularly during financially challenged times. The various case studies in this corpus often focus on one or two main areas of strengths that bred success such as campus collaboration <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, community engagement <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, innovation <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, or evidence-based service design <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A second genre of DH and library literature focuses on paradigmatic digital humanities projects produced either solely from libraries or as the result of library/campus partnerships. For example, in their book chapter,  “Digital Public History in the Library” , Battle, Mobley, and Gilbert chronicle their workflow and editorial process in curating the Lowcountry Digital History Initiative at the College of Charleston <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Our own contribution to the genre,  “Kindles, card catalogs, and the future of libraries: a collaborative digital humanities project”  highlights a topic modeling project initiated by two librarians, Anna Neatrour and Rebekah Cummings, and a digital humanities researcher, Dr. Elizabeth Callaway, at the University of Utah <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. These contributions to the digital humanities and libraries corpus model a useful roadmap for other librarians to undertake similar projects.</p>
<p>A third and final subgenre of DH+Lib articles focuses on the broader role that libraries can and should play in advancing and supporting digital humanities. The tone of these articles generally range from cautiously optimistic to openly skeptical regarding the investment that libraries make in digital humanities infrastructure. In  “Evolving in Common: Creating Mutually Supportive Relationships Between Libraries and the Digital Humanities” , Vandegrift and Varner focus on the strengths that libraries bring to DH and see academic librarians as valuable intellectual partners <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Schaffer and Erway, on the other hand, believe that only rarely should an academic library invest in a robust DH center and that, for most libraries, lower levels of support are a better use of resources <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Other articles advocate caution and list items for consideration when investing in digital humanities <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The aforementioned subgenres are not exhaustive nor are they mutually exclusive. Nearly every Building a DH Center paper highlights a successful project and reflects, at least implicitly, on the role libraries should play in digital humanities. Moreover, these articles frequently rely upon the experiences of the author in building a DH center or engaging in digital scholarship projects.</p>
<p>While this article fits squarely in the Building a DH Center genre, our aim is to do more than simply summarize our experience. Rather, by reflecting on our history and process, we identify the local, structural, and cultural factors shaping the Digital Matters Lab as well as generalizable lessons for building and sustaining a digital humanities center. For example, sustained engagement with digital humanities literature through biweekly reading groups informed our early decisions in setting a course for the Digital Matters Lab and helped us think critically about how our burgeoning lab fit into the larger ecosystem of DH Centers.</p>
<h2 id="boom-and-bust-the-history-of-dh-centers-at-the-university-of-utah-2007-2018">Boom and Bust: The History of DH Centers at the University of Utah (2007-2018)</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the Digital Matters working group quickly discovered that disparate digital humanities/scholarship efforts had been underway at the University of Utah for nearly a decade. In 2007, a technology instruction librarian at the Marriott Library returned from the Digital Scholarship/Digital Libraries Symposium at Emory University inspired to pursue a DH build. Fortuitously, her exposure to Digital Humanities coincided with a renovation at the Marriott Library that included a planned Advanced Technology Studio. Under her leadership, the multimedia center expanded to include Digital Humanities services, including qualitative data and textual analysis, GIS services, an AV Studio, and data management services, resulting in the Digital Scholarship Lab (DSL) in September 2009. By 2010, the Digital Scholarship Lab had hired a GIS specialist, reassigned three existing staff members to DSL, led a variety of software workshops, and hosted a Digital Scholarship Fair to highlight their burgeoning DH services.</p>
<p>The Digital Scholarship Lab failed. Despite early administrative buy-in, staff enthusiasm, and limited technological support, it was never able to summon a critical mass of engagement with campus partners. Post-recession funding required library administration to shift its focus to sustaining core library services, and campus assessments revealed a lack of interest and understanding of digital scholarship services. After seven years of struggle, it was subsumed by another department and the Digital Scholarship Lab was officially disbanded in 2014, while individual services such as GIS, data management, and the A/V Studio were spun off — and now thrive — in other areas, such as the Marriott Library’s Creativity and Innovation Services department.</p>
<p>In many ways, the librarians at the Marriott Library were simply ahead of the curve; a robust digital scholarship community did not yet exist at the University of Utah. The Digital Scholarship Lab functioned in isolation of the rest of the campus, and efforts to offer services or engage in collaborative research fell short without resources for faculty incentives and/or established buy-in from administrators. Awareness of digital humanities had not yet reached the necessary inflection point for other departments to seek opportunities in the field. That is not to say that the DSL would have succeeded if it had simply appeared several years later, but the addiitonal burden of defining DH for stakeholders while the Digital Scholarship Lab was in its infancy compounded its difficulties. Finally, founding and housing the Digital Scholarship Lab in the library, for better or worse, brought to bear service-oriented associations that did not necessarily speak to more research-oriented faculty.</p>
<p>Ironically, just as library administration shuttered the doors on the Digital Scholarship Lab, elsewhere on campus, digital humanities was starting to gain traction. Leveraging a block of funding for strategic hires in digital humanities, the English Department brought on two scholars in 2015 and 2016, Dr. David Roh and Dr. Lisa Swanstrom, with a mandate to build a DH community and space. Moreover, three colleges at the University of Utah — College of Humanities, College of Fine Arts, and College of Architecture+Planning — independently reached out to the Marriott Library in 2015 to gauge interest in developing a shared digital scholarship space. Still mindful of the Digital Scholarship Lab’s isolation and failed attempts at engagement, early discussions overcorrected slightly — initial talks comprised of more than thirty representatives from all four partner colleges! After nearly a decade, administrative will, faculty research interests, and library support regarding digital humanities had finally converged.</p>
<p>The Digital Matters working group met from fall 2015 to spring 2017 and later transitioned to a more nimble steering committee, consisting of six representatives from all partner colleges, that assumed leadership and kept the deans apprised of its efforts. By 2015, digital humanities had become a common buzzword in academic libraries, and we strove to learn from the experiences of other libraries who had successfully built digital humanities programs. The first phase of information gathering included a series of interviews with Digital Humanities researchers Dan Cohen (Center for New Media and History, DPLA), Miriam Posner (UCLA Center for Digital Humanities), Bethany Nowviskie (University of Virginia Scholars’ Lab), and John Unsworth (Brandeis University). A few notable themes emerged from these interviews:<br>
A lab is a community. A strong community will be reflected in an active, vibrant space. To do so, the lab should be a democratic environment empowering students and staff. Moreover, staffing and expertise should take precedence over technology and decor.  Strong relationships with a supportive administration are necessary. Not only does administrative financial backing alleviate the need to rely on grant funding, but the importance of political capital should not be overlooked.  The mission should be driven by local needs. Some centers build tools, some support faculty, others digitize content, and still others emphasize teaching. Rather than trying to do everything in an unfocused manner, strategize, and be selective. A narrow and focused mission should guide priorities.</p>
<p>We worked in stages. The first stage would be establishing a physical presence on campus so that we could begin to build a community. In fall 2016, the Digital Matters Lab Pop-Up Space moved into the Marriott Library with a launch party. The space was light on technology but was equipped with collaborative spaces, whiteboards, and a few desktop workstations. More than offering computing power and expensive equipment, the temporary space became a hub where we could start building relationships by hosting talks, workshops, reading groups, and a monthly research interest group.</p>
<p>The second stage was to secure funding. Thanks to a mix of serendipity and infrastructure, in May 2016 the Marriott Library Development team secured $1 Million from an anonymous donor for staffing, equipment, and buildout of the Digital Matters Lab. Heeding the advice we had received in our exploratory phase, we elected to use the money to secure five years of staffing and modest equipment while we continue to raise money for the permanent space. The steering committee had to then discuss several questions regarding personnel: what constitutes core staff for a digital humanities space? Should they conduct a national search or hire from within? Is there an immediate need for a developer? The committee considered the merits hiring various configurations of Director, Librarian, Programmer/Developer, Operations Manager, graduate students, visiting fellows, grant writer, and post-docs. The finalized structure was determined by a consideration of the objectives and goals for the next five years — sustainability, a regional identity, and campus integration. Ultimately, the steering committee decided that the first hire would be the Digital Matters Director who would set a vision for the Lab including its long-term sustainability. The Marriott Library created a faculty line to hire a dedicated Digital Matters Librarian who would be responsible for supporting projects, organizing speakers, workshops, and various training opportunities, and liaising with relevant and existing library services such metadata, copyright, and IT services. Our five-year budget also included significant resources set aside to fund semester-long faculty and graduate student fellowships and to eventually hire a program assistant to staff the front desk, maintain the website, and assist the Director and Librarian in the operations and events of the Lab.</p>
<p>As of this writing, we are in the third and current stage — implementation. Over several months in 2017, the steering committee undertook the unglamorous work of hiring a director and librarian, procuring equipment, furniture, and a semi-permanent facility. Later, as the Digital Matters Lab became more of a known quantity, chance opportunities led to the hiring of an additional post-doctoral scholar from Environmental Humanities and faculty fellow from Multi-Disciplinary Design.</p>
<h2 id="local-color-strategizing-around-projects-2018-present">Local Color: Strategizing Around Projects (2018-present)</h2>
<p>The Digital Matters Lab mission is to be the locus for digital humanities research on campus and to build a national reputation for our center, through integrating digital scholarship with cultural criticism and theory while remaining grounded in our local surroundings in Utah. We sought to penetrate the campus’s consciousness by adding value, with the eventual goal of reaching financial and reputational stability so that the Digital Matters Lab can withstand budgetary vagaries.</p>
<p>We began the process by embarking on a fact-finding mission to learn the respective priorities and character of our partner departments and schools. We met regularly to develop relationships and, at times, define digital scholarship and digital humanities in relation to their fields. It was also imperative to carefully consider university legacies and strengths; for example, the University of Utah is renowned for its Entertainment Arts and Engineering (EAE)<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  program where students learn the fundamentals of video game development and animation. Accordingly, it would make sense for the Digital Matters Lab to incorporate game studies into its programming and projects. Similarly, the Marriott Library has an unparalleled Book Arts Program,<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  which focuses on the materiality and affordances of a print media; a strategic alignment of goals, including hosting credit-bearing classes and collaborative exhibitions, would be mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it behooved us to learn of the individual researchers and centers on campus that have created digital scholarship and public-facing research projects. For example, since the 1960s, the American West Center<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  has collected and digitized oral histories of western peoples and lands. Faculty members in English and Computer Science had developed software for poetic visualization, Poemage.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  Professors of dance worked in virtual reality environments, capturing choreography with drones. Over in the School of Music, a faculty member collaborated with metadata specialists in the library to create an opera database, SongHelix,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  to promote discoverability of songs by a litany of criteria for recitals. When planning for the first year, it benefited us to meet with faculty to think through how to best serve, connect, and promote the existing research going on at the University of Utah.</p>
<p>To underscore the critical component and local environmental concerns of our mission, we selected a theme, sustainability as an organizing principle for the first four years. The theme helped us develop a narrative that would lend cohesiveness to our fledgling center and would also be legible to administration, donors, and other stakeholders. Forming connections and figuring out our place in the university and the broader digital community went hand-in-hand with building an identity as a lab that pushed the frontiers of critically-engaged digital research. We strategically chose projects, workshops, and speakers that integrated cultural criticism into their visions of digital arts and humanities. Sustainability not only prompts us to think of the durability of digital projects, but also asks us to think differently about the timescales on which we usually consider technology; instead of thinking in processing times and milliseconds, sustainability might prompt us to consider the millennia that our e-waste takes to degrade. Sustainability also challenges us to turn a critical eye toward our own methods, practices, and assumptions as digital humanities practitioners. We have to ask: what does digital humanities itself sustain? And how can we build a lab that is conscientious about what it seeks to sustain and what it chooses not to? Ultimately, the idea of sustainability challenged us not only to think thematically around environmental issues, but structurally as we considered the long-term viability of our projects in terms of preservation, documentation, and formats.</p>
<p>Finally, the theme of sustainability foregrounds our situatedness in Utah. At the same time that Utah has been the location of important events in the history of trans-continental communication technology systems (the golden spike, the golden splice, and fourth node of Arpanet), it has also become a testing ground for our environmental futures. Often these technological advances go hand-in-hand with rising environmental concerns. Utah has been the location of many commercial data centers such as those for Twitter, eBay, and Oracle <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. But while commercial data centers benefit from cheap water, that does not reflect its scarcity in a drought-prone state. At the same time that Utah is the site for vanguard technology development, it sits at the forefront of debates about public lands, climate change, and air quality. Our situatedness puts us into a political, environmental, technological history rife with the intersection of technological and environmental concerns. The Digital Matters logo, a simplified topographic representation of the Great Salt Lake, whose water levels are steadily declining, not only reflects local geography but recognizes an arid future (see Figure 1).</p>

<p>The lab continues to build a repertoire of critical digital research while building bridges to other entities across campus and engaging with technological issues and the environment. The work of the lab falls into the standard categories of research, instruction, and support. Rather than give a detailed description of each project, we present a broader, birds-eye view of the work that may be organizationally useful for understanding how to build a DH centers or program.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>As all members of the staff joined Digital Matters with their own ongoing research projects, we were committed to maintaining time for them. For example, Rebekah Cummings arrived with an active portfolio in data management and metadata studies; David Roh and Elizabeth Callaway, trained in English, had their respective ongoing monographs, in addition to their own experimental DH projects. Fortunately, around the same time the Marriott Library started emphasizing research among the tenure-track librarians, so our pursuing individual research agendas aligned with the library’s strategic shift. There was no requirement for research to tie directly with Digital Matters, but the hope was that as our interests evolved in the lab environment, a natural convergence would occur. Moreover, rather than have a set percentage of time devoted to self-directed research projects, a focus on research naturally unfolded as part of the culture. For instance, at the beginning of each semester, we met to outline our goals, which not only included our commitments to Digital Matters, but our own research objectives. We could then discuss time commitments, scheduling, and workloads as book projects and articles went underwent various phases of production. Encouraging transparency not only allowed us to make room for each member, but also provided a welcome source accountability.</p>
<p>In addition to continuing to pursue our research agendas, we sought to engage with two types of research projects — a collaborative, multi-institutional research project of local significance, and funding faculty and graduate student projects across the four partner colleges of the College of Humanities, College of Fine Arts, College of Architecture+Planning, and the Marriott Library, guided by the broader contours of our theme, sustainability. After a few false starts, we collaborated with a local nonprofit, Better Days 2020,<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  and colleagues at Brigham Young University’s Office of Digital Humanities to build an Omeka exhibit to highlight the 150th anniversary of women’s suffrage in Utah, centered on the digitizing, tagging, and analysis of the  <em>Woman’s Exponent</em> , a nineteenth century Mormon feminist publication printed in Salt Lake City. While Utah is quick to claim its place in history as the first state in which women cast a ballot, there is more complex, nuanced story involving intersections of suffrage, polygamy, and statehood. Still in the early stages, this project aims to produce new knowledge and speak to the wider community in Salt Lake City and Utah.</p>
<p>In terms of funding research projects, we offer two graduate residency fellowships and four faculty fellowships each year. This not only supports projects that otherwise might not get off the ground but also legitimizes digital scholarship across campus. In the first year offering these fellowships, our independent advisory board selected projects that engage in some way with our four-year theme of sustainability and with concerns important to Utah. Both of the Spring 2019 graduate fellows worked on digital/material art projects focusing on the environment in the west. One graduate fellow, Tiana Birrell, used her time in the Lab to map the extensive network of data centers, including the National Security Administration (NSA), in Utah and the complicated network of rivers, dams, and pipes that contribute to the cooling of those servers. A product of her research is an art installation in the Lab comprised of video projection and sculptural elements that convey the materiality and physicality of Utah’s network of rivers, water, and data. A goal of her project — and the public art that accompanies it — is to prompt discussion of local environmental concerns by highlighting the significant allocation of public resources to these data centers, whose companies select Utah expressly for its cheap water and electricity, low seismic activity, few natural disasters, and access to an international airport. Our second inaugural graduate student fellow, Jace Brittain, explored the tension between human and animal agency through a literary aesthetic, focusing on the epidemic of bark beetles and forest decimation in Utah. By using a combination of 3D scans, prints, poetry and prose, this work speculatively makes legible the inscrutable patterns bark beetles create in boring through tree surfaces. Using digital art as a commentary on nature, global warming, and agency granted immediacy to this phenomenon, which has a tremendous effect on Utah’s ecosystems yet often feels abstracted from daily life.</p>
<p>Our faculty fellows’ projects similarly engage with local interests, in this case, discourses of ownership of public and private bodies, and the relationship between technology and indigeneity. Faculty fellow, Dr. Wendy Wisher, developed a piece exploring the resonances between attitudes and policies toward public lands and women&rsquo;s reproductive rights in Utah to propose a relationship between the two. Another faculty fellow, Dr. Lourdes Alberto, created a digital archive of documents generated by social activism in diasporic indigenous communities. While not solely selected for their environmental/sustainability focus, these projects reflect the range of interests expressed in our applicant pool of faculty and students and speak to the interests of the broader Utah population.</p>
<h2 id="instruction">Instruction</h2>
<p>Instruction ranges from workshops on tools, skills, and best-practices for faculty to semester-length courses for undergraduates. Our workshop series not only trains scholars in digital humanities tools and methods, but serves as an opportunity to strengthen our mission of being the locus for digital research on campus. Topics are decided by the community by way of surveys and polls during the planning process, and connecting with experts to lead workshops helps develop relationships. Workshops focus not only on tools, but methods and competencies; sessions on Tableau, Gephi, and Omeka might be interspersed with Data Management for the Arts and Humanities or Storytelling with Data. Tool-based workshops are possibly the most challenging activity during which to explicitly incorporate our stated commitment to digital cultural studies and sustainability, but the choice of sample datasets instructors choose to teach with often lead to critical discussions about cultural assumptions and the implications of its affordances. We have found that there are ways to build self-reflexivity into even the most tool-centered aspects of our programming.</p>
<p>These skill-based workshops are complemented by the digital humanities-related undergraduate courses. The DML Director, Dr. David Roh, teaches digital humanities in the Department of English, and there are plans for experimental, project-based courses in the Honors College. Additionally, we are working with invested departments and the upper administration to implement a digital humanities certificate for undergraduates, which incorporates classes in media studies, computer science, cultural studies, as well as modules offered by the Digital Matters Lab.</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>In addition to supporting projects with funding, the DML also provides the space and opportunities for serendipitous encounters among researchers from different departments and disciplines beyond the partner colleges. A Research Interest Group (RIG) is open to all and meets regularly for events ranging from a speakers series to reading groups to works-in-progress presentations; topics covered may range from as environmental art or long-term data curation. The RIG provides occasions for regular encounters among scholars from a variety of backgrounds, which then lead to the building of a community that may result in collaborations on a given project. Informal interactions expand the circle of proficiencies that participants can draw upon when exploring research questions. Ideally, support and space results in the profile of the lab as an interdisciplinary nexus to span the entire length of the institution.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The Digital Matters Lab’s launch at the University of Utah is not intended as a blueprint for other organizations to follow. If anything, we have learned that our identity, mission, and services are the direct result of our unique environment, partners, and individuals associated with the center. That said, many of the lessons we have learned mirror those of other successful digital humanities centers. In this section we have attempted to parse what lessons are broadly applicable as opposed to the more localized solutions and experiences we have chronicled above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic Partnerships/Collaboration is key. Beyond spreading risk and pooling resources, partnering with several academic partners within campus led to a sense of shared ownership and institutional investment in the DML — in our case, the College of Humanities, Fine Arts, Architecture+Planning, and the Marriott Library. Moreover, by appointing a contact person for each college — as members of the advisory board — we could ask them to represent the interests of their constituents, as well as convey our programs, projects, and mission to them — a bilateral relationship. This has the additional benefit of structurally integrating the unique strengths and foci of the university, rather than the DML venturing into areas that may not align with the strategic missions of its partners. That is not to say that having several partnerships is not without risk; the danger was that attempting to integrate conflicting interests could leave the DML rudderless or desultory. To counter committee paralysis, leadership had to take responsibility for a vision and direction while listening and integrating comments, with the understanding that s/he will not be able to please everyone.</li>
<li>Lab identity should emerge organically in response to the environment. While we polled and consulted with a number of more established DH institutions, we were mindful of the fact that we would need to adapt our priorities and character to our particular placement and character. For us, this meant leveraging the existing strengths of our institution, such as game studies and history of the American West. A focus on locality also led us to select projects that speak to concerns such as water rights, public lands, air quality, and moments of local historical significance such the 150th anniversary of women’s suffrage in Utah.</li>
<li>Sustainability is important but we must also allow for an experimental culture where people feel allowed to fail or let projects die. With a new venture, there is an incentive to take a conservative approach; after all, we have the dual pressures of demonstrating our value to administration and figuring out a means of stretching finite resources. At the same time, much of the research may not bear fruit, or be immediately legible — and we want to allow for a culture that provides room for research that is innovative, experimental, and even risky. Taking a page from other institutions, we grant latitude for individual researchers and staff to work on their own projects, with no expectation for success or outcome other than their own intellectual fulfillment.</li>
<li>There is an inherent tension between what the administration and development office want (e.g. glittery technology, such as a visualization wall) and what researchers need (e.g. human capital, flexibility, funding).<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  It has also become clear that while administrative support may be enthusiastic, there is a gap in priorities regarding their needs and the needs of the DML. For research purposes, it may be that most of the high costs come in the form of human capital — salaries for staff, researchers, and students to dedicate time for their respective projects. At the same time, funding begets funding in the sense that tangible and sleek technological apparatus may enchant and attract attention. We have to think strategically in purchasing equipment that maximizes attention and utility.</li>
<li>A multi-pronged approach. Mindful as we are of the kind of argument we are attempting to make with our campus presence over the next few years, we must balance the logistics of building a tight enough portfolio to distribute our limited bandwidth efficiently with the need to integrate ourselves into the greater campus in a way that results in a net positive. To that end, the DML facilitates workshops for undergraduate, graduate students, and faculty, consults on external projects, in addition to its own internal research.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-sustainable-futures">Conclusion: Sustainable Futures?</h2>
<p>Like many Digital Humanities centers, the future of the Digital Matters Lab is promising but uncertain, and we suspect that its fate will depend on whether we are able to make a convincing argument for its contributions on several fronts — institutionally, regionally, and nationally. With enough initial funding to last four years, the DML must make a compelling case with university administration and campus constituents for its continued existence. Our first year (2018-2019) focused on infrastructure — hiring staff, establishing identity, formalizing workflows, setting a research agenda, and creating visibility. With a small staff comprised of two faculty members and a post-doc, we juggled the responsibilities of research, teaching, and service with administrative tasks such as maintaining our website, planning events, and ordering promotional material.</p>
<p>Our primary concern heading into the second year is sustainability and permanence. As we move out of the foundation-building phase, we begin to consider what projects, staff, relationships, and services will mark us as an indispensable campus resource. Chief in our minds are the lessons learned from previous iterations of digital scholarship centers and services on campus and nationwide. One of those lessons is that DML needs to avoid insularity and remain connected to digital scholarship efforts across campus and across Utah. DML faculty and staff will continue to provide learning and research opportunities to undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty to build a portfolio of innovative projects that speak to local concerns and our theme of sustainability. Grant opportunities will be considered and pursued when they align with the goals of the Digital Matters Lab but will not be used to maintain core staff and services.</p>
<p>The Digital Matters Lab benefits from administrative support, five years of secure funding, and established cross-campus partnerships, but the long-term future is far from secure. We strive to cultivate the right mix of digital scholarships services, research and funding opportunities, instructional programming, and an active DH community that will be compelling to donors and administrators. Ultimately, the creation of a stable Digital Matters Lab and a permanent funding line for its staff relies on our ability to establish the DML as an invaluable hub for computationally enhanced humanities research and pedagogy, and a necessary resource at the University of Utah.</p>

<p>It was a rainy fall night in October 2014. I finally sat down to play the game  <em>P.T.</em>  (7780s Studio, 2014), a survival horror game that games media had widely publicized in the past couple months.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  I sat on my couch in the dark — perhaps not the wisest decision — and began to play. In the game I found myself in a dimly-lit hallway. I looked around at the different objects it contained, such as pictures, notes, a phone, and a radio, and paused for a while on a door eerily cracked open, until it suddenly slammed shut. I reached the end of the hallway eventually and opened the door there to find myself in the exact same hallway. This happened each time I opened that door, and each time I encountered copies of the hallway with changes ranging from the small (an object in a different place) to the major (suddenly the entire hallway was red with flashing and spinning lights). Finally, I got stuck: I seemed to be encountering the same version of the hallway over and over, and nothing seemed to change. I looked up guides and walkthroughs for the game to figure out what I was missing and learned that I needed to do  <em>something</em>  to get the in-game phone to ring, though no one seemed to know what that something was. So I started trying everything I could: interacting with every item, walking down the hallway backwards, and turning the radio on and off countless times. I even tried whispering into the PlayStation 4 microphone, per a Reddit suggestion, but still the phone didn’t ring. I’m still not sure what I did to trigger the phone-ringing event––perhaps the game just pitied me for taking so long to figure it out.</p>
<p>This brief narration of my experience with  <em>P.T.</em>  is an illustration of a larger point, namely that players have different experiences and thus different stories in the games they play. On the one hand, my story is unique. No one else has had my exact experience of playing  <em>P.T.</em>  in my apartment, navigating  <em>P.T.</em> ’s hallway, encountering the game’s events (some randomly generated), or getting stuck where I did. On the other hand, my story is quite common in that all players of  <em>P.T.</em>  have their own versions of it. While we all encountered different parts of the game at different times and in different ways, there are still many images, objects, events, and feelings that we all experienced sooner or later. This shared-but-varied phenomenon in game narrative is the result of player interaction with the game, and is both afforded and limited by what the game system (hardware, software, interfaces, etc.) and the players themselves make possible. Games achieve a sense of individuality through interaction by accommodating (intentionally or otherwise) a wide variety of play styles and allowing players to make different decisions in order to keep the game interesting <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Matthew Miller, one of the creators of the MMORPG  <em>City of Heroes</em> , describes this dilemma:  “We wanted players to have unique experiences as they played through the game, so that when a group of players got together, they could talk about [their exploits], and it wouldn’t be identical to everyone else in the room”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Play demands the freedom and potential for difference, and as players navigate games they create their own unique (and yet similar) narratives.</p>
<p>Of course game studies scholars have long noted that the player’s ability to affect a narrative through gameplay is the defining characteristic of game narratives.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  In this framework, game developers and theorists such as Chris Crawford have often discussed interactivity as something of a problem for game narrative and experience, even going so far as to say that there is an  “apparent incompatibility between plot and interactivity”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. The issue that Crawford and others have identified is that narratives need to have structure and coherence on some level, whereas interactivity and play are more about the flowing emergence of possibilities that often buck against the limitations of narrative’s structure. This tension, while not insurmountable, is why we seem to be less likely or willing to call a sequence of representations a narrative the more variable that sequence is. Thus when players discussing the same game relate drastically different experiences with the same content, such as puzzles and bosses solved or beaten differently; different paths taken or choices made; or even entirely different characters and plots, we’re less likely to call that content narrative. The reality of shifting and unstable content poses a difficulty for games scholars of all sorts (players are always doing unexpected things), but is particularly challenging for those attempting to locate central themes, meanings, and stories in a given game and play experience. How does one begin to account for all of these possibilities for variation? Or, to put it another way, how does one stabilize a game’s narrative enough to begin to make claims about it, without ignoring the emergent qualities of that narrative?</p>
<p>In response to these difficulties and questions, a number of scholars have proposed ludonarrative as a concept that unites storytelling with the emergent qualities of play. As Tison Pugh explains, ludonarrative is a  “hybrid hermeneutic”  that looks at the shared structures of games and narratives, including the intersections between them in video games and other media <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The experience of narrative in video games is one where  “you, the player (or reader, one could say), are suddenly thrown into someone else’s story and are expected to continue the tale,”  and this experience reveals  “the notion of the text as being informed by the process of play and as being characterised by multiplicity”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. In other words, video games demonstrate how narrative can be playful, variable, and divergent, and this can be true of other narrative texts such as novels, films, or comics that invite their readers or viewers to form their own interpretations and experiences. Within video games, ludonarrative approaches seek to understand the  “whole”  of a game by viewing gameplay, story, and the player in their many relationships with each other, rather than viewing narrative and play as inherently opposed, conflicting elements as previous scholarship often did <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While ludonarrative provides a framework for understanding the interrelated natures of narrative and play, there remain many questions about what forms ludonarrative can (or could) take and how players use them. Most scholars working with game narrative, including ludonarrative ones, have generalized the issue of divergent player experience by pointing to the possibilities for it, and perhaps exploring a few of those major possibilities in a given genre or game. At best, some scholars have utilized social scientific methods for player interviews, forums research, and community studies to understand how different players engage with and interpret a game.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  These studies are extremely valuable in how they account for the player’s role in game narrative and experience, but they are also limited by sample sizes and what players remember or are consciously aware of in their gameplay. Such issues are largely unavoidable, and are not a significant detriment to the studies. However we have yet to develop a method that allows for the assessment of moment-to-moment experiences of a game and its story, including both what is common to different player’s playthroughs and what is different. In other words, while ludonarrative helps account for how narrative is interactive and variable in games and other media, we have only begun to assess the types and amounts of variance that are possible in particular game genres and individual games. One way to start doing this is to examine recordings of different players’ playthroughs of the same games, such as Let’s Play videos on YouTube and other streaming services. As Roth et al. note, these videos are  “qualitative samples for the evaluation of the interactive narrative user experience”  that have hereto been ignored in game narrative scholarship <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This article provides a new method for using video recordings of gameplay to study similarity, difference, and variation in narrative caused by player interaction. It does so utilizing emerging digital humanities tools for distance visualization of visual media, such as the ImagePlot macro for ImageJ. ImagePlot is software that takes a collection of images and plots those images on a basic graph where the x and y axes correspond to different, quantifiable characteristics of the images. I will explain this process and its affordances and limitations in more depth shortly, but for now note that ImagePlot allows for the analysis of many types of visual media, including paintings, photographs, film, and of course video games. For the purpose of visualizing narrative variation in games, ImagePlot allows one to take a video recording of gameplay, extract the images from it, and plot those on a graph so an entire playthrough of a game is visible in one image (Figure 1). This distance visualization allows for storing, representing, and analyzing player experiences on a scale previously impossible: one can view a player’s entire playthrough of a game in one image, and then compare that playthrough with tens or hundreds of other playthroughs at a time. Further, rather than relying on player experience abstracted from actual play or reported from memory afterward, this distance visualization relies on video recording of play as it happened. By plotting the images extracted from the playthroughs of games by different players, one can begin to trace how variable a given game’s play experiences can be. A comparison of playthrough imageplots reveals the exact what and when of similarities or differences between a large number of player experiences with the same game. The imageplots also connect with exact measures of time and image qualities (such as brightness, hue, or even objects in the images), allowing the assessment of the magnitude of difference in a game, and providing some answers as to just how variable the variability of a game’s ludonarrative is. This article will focus specifically on variance in time (at what point players encounter something, and how long it takes them to play) and sign (what players encounter, the content of the images in the imageplot).</p>

<p>Developing these methods and answering the question of how variable a game’s ludonarrative is presents an opportunity to reconsider narrative form. Despite attempts to expand narrative in recent decades, such as the theories that space itself is narrative or that human perception of reality is dependent on narrative, the concept of narrative has remained limited to being a linear or at best multilinear form.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  Even scholars of cognitive narrative processes such as David Herman and Marie-Laure Ryan, whose theories of narrative emphasize how it generates  “possible worlds”  with many potential outcomes (similar to the multiplicities of ludonarrative), have yet to account for how much difference and variation is possible in narrative experience, interpretation, and construction <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. It has remained difficult to assess just how much is possible in making possible worlds, or how far a narrative can change or stretch before it becomes either another narrative entirely or something unrecognizable as narrative. Yet if we can build on these theories of interactivity and possible difference by focusing more on specific lived experiences and instances of variation, we can arrive at an understanding of narrative form that is less focused on linear or multilinear outcomes and more attentive to the procedural and emergent construction of narrative similarities and differences. Such a ludonarrative understanding of narrative would emphasize the relationality of signs and open up room for their change and motion, rather than seeking to fix them in set times, places, and interpretations.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  Shira Chess points toward this potential in her theorization of video game narratives as queer narratives that forego normative teleological structures of climax; instead games present narratives that are non-reproductive and continuous <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Imageplots further the conception of narrative as an ongoing, shifting, and possibly queer process by visualizing narrative as it unfolds and providing a means of assessing difference and continuity throughout the playing of a game.</p>
<p>In pushing us to consider narrative as an active and changeable form that requires play and emergence, the imageplots and the distance visualization they provide contribute a method to the renewed discourse on forms, perhaps best captured in Caroline Levine’s  <em>Forms</em> . Levine defines form as  “all shapes and configurations, all ordering principles, all patterns of repetition and difference,”  and goes on to say that narrative is the form that best captures how different forms  “collide” :  “the strange encounter between two or more forms that sometimes reroutes intention and ideology”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. The collisions in forms that Levine identifies are observable in the play of similarities and differences in player experiences that are captured in imageplots. As players encounter content in a game, their actions affect the form of that content — its duration, its arrangement, and its relation to other forms in the game. Imageplots capture the effects of this interactivity in the form of visual signs and suggest that narrative in games is best understood as a particular sequence or arrangement of moving and colliding signs. The signs that are common to all playthroughs of a game can be taken together as the primary or central narrative of the game: they are the core experience that causes the game to cohere as one game, one system of rules and possibilities for players to play with. The signs that are different from playthrough to playthrough indicate the places and parts of the game where the player can deviate from the central narrative and create their own unique experience of it. Taken together, the differences reveal how variable that narrative is, or how much play there is to it: more differences mean greater opportunity for play and variation, and fewer differences mean less.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of the distance analysis method proposed here is to locate patterns in the visual signs between playthroughs, and to thereby identify both the common and different meanings, experiences, and possibilities in a game. In terms of ludonarrative, this means being able to establish a central narrative to a game that is not limited to the game’s scripted elements, but can also accommodate player input and individual experience. This method can provide new insights on how players influence game narrative, and what degree of emergence comes with that influence. Furthermore, such a study of game narrative can contribute to moving game studies and narrative theory beyond accounting for interactivity and variation in abstraction, and gain a more solid grasp of narrative as a form that is flexible, emergent, and yet limited, always in a playful relationship with its audience. By doing so, we can better perceive the possibilities for difference that exist in current games, and how we might play within games and other visual media in order to produce new and transformative narratives. If we can see narrative forms in a given text, then we can better understand how those forms operate, how we can change them, and what we can imagine through them.</p>
<h2 id="imageplots-as-visual-archives">Imageplots as Visual Archives</h2>
<p>This opportunity to rethink visual narrative form is made possible by ImagePlot, a macro for the software ImageJ, which is usually used for the analysis of large quantities of images (such as brain scans) in medical science. ImageJ is developed and updated by the National Institutes of Health, and the software allows for a variety of plugins and macros for different types of image analysis. ImagePlot is one such macro, and was created by a team led by Lev Manovich as part of the Software Studies Initiative.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  ImagePlot takes a collection of images and plots it on a graph according to preset data points. For example, the imageplots included here are plotted with a x-axis of time, and a randomly generated y-axis (Figure 2).<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  In effect, this means that the imageplots represent the temporal progression of images in the collection, or in other words they present the images in the order that they appear in the video. The progression from the left to the right side of the graph mirrors the progression of the video, with the left side of the imageplot being the beginning of the video and the right side its end, and each column on the graph contains images from the same moment in the video. This mapping of images onto a graph provides a distance visualization of a video, allowing one to change the scale of the data and see all of the video at once, instead of only seeing individual parts at a time. In this sense, ImagePlot is similar to many other digital humanities tools (such as those used for network analysis, topic modeling, etc.) that help us zoom out from a particular moment in a text or corpus and see larger trends across many moments and texts. ImagePlot allows us to do the same for visual media, and this method is only one of its many potential applications in the analysis of photos, paintings, film, and video games.</p>

<p>This project uses ImagePlot to visualize entire playthroughs of video games, such as  <em>P.T.</em> , the game I narrated earlier. The process does not require any coding knowledge, but rather involves using a series of files in conjunction with ImageJ. In order to run the ImagePlot macro, one first needs a collection of images and an associated file or spreadsheet with the filenames of the images and any other necessary data, such as a value for hue or saturation in the images. To generate these, a number of video files were downloaded from YouTube, where each video was a complete playthrough of a game recorded and posted online. Next, images were extracted from each of the videos, and organized in separate folders. A data spreadsheet for each video was populated with its corresponding image filenames, and each image was assigned a random y-value. Finally, ImagePlot was used in ImageJ with the collections of images and spreadsheets to plot the images on graphs. In sum, one could describe the process as downloading the videos, extracting the images, organizing the images, and then plotting the images.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  This entire process is in every way mediated by software, and the end result is a particular form of data and knowledge quite different from simply watching a video of a playthrough on YouTube. ImagePlot and ImageJ thus fit into a larger technological trend that Manovich identifies as software creating new media, which he defines as  “a combination of particular techniques for generation, editing and accessing content”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Imageplots are a new way of viewing and accessing existing media through distance visualization, and in this regard they are a form of new media. Yet they are also their own new form of content, making ImagePlot and ImageJ (the software that creates them) new media as well.</p>
<p>The imageplots included primarily come from one game —  <em>P.T.</em>  — in the survival horror genre, which tasks players with playing and surviving while being frightened by horror graphics and settings. I have limited my analysis to one game and one genre in order to isolate narrative variation coming from player interaction and experience, rather than coming from the differences between different games or game genres. While any game genre could work for this analysis, I selected the survival horror genre for its tendency to limit player actions in order to create a sense of fear. Survival horror games often take place in constrained spaces and supply few options for players in order to keep them on set paths and force confrontation — after all, monsters are not as scary if one can completely avoid them <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. As such, survival horror games have hypothetically fewer variations between playthroughs, making those variations more consistent and noticeable. I selected  <em>P.T.</em>  in particular because it is a uniquely excellent case study for narrative variation due to its content and cultural context.  <em>P.T.</em>  is an abbreviation of Playable Teaser, and was originally intended, as its name suggests, as a teaser for a new  <em>Silent Hill</em>  game being directed by Hideo Kojima (perhaps most famous for the  <em>Metal Gear</em>  franchise). The game is relatively short, containing only about an hour’s worth of play time, and consists of repeatedly exploring the same hallway in a dark house with different encounters on each repeat. Thus repetition and variation are inherent to the game’s structure and narrative, and the game provides an exemplary space for using those concepts to measure player interactivity and differences between playthroughs.</p>
<p>The playthroughs of  <em>P.T.</em>  visualized in these imageplots are taken from various YouTube videos and Twitch streams and include playthroughs by popular streamers and regular players.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  There are a large number of them available, mostly due to  <em>P.T.</em> ’s notoriety–after Konami cancelled the upcoming  <em>Silent Hill</em>  game and removed access to  <em>P.T.</em>  in April 2015, the game became an instant cult classic. Each playthrough plotted is a complete playing of  <em>P.T.</em> , in some cases accompanied by visuals associated with the YouTube channel at the beginning or end of the video. I have specifically excluded playthroughs that are heavily edited, as the additional visual elements added to those playthroughs introduce a bias toward similarity in the images. Heavy editing or removal of parts of the play experience also defeats the purpose of capturing and visualizing actual play, and instead creates its own entertainment media further removed from the game itself. Three of the playthroughs contain images of the player superimposed on the gameplay (as with many Twitch streams), but in the resulting imageplots the images from the player cameras are small enough to be unnoticeable without zooming in.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this process worth mentioning before diving into analyzing the imageplots. The ability to produce imageplots of game playthroughs is limited by having (or not having) access to video recordings of the game in question. This means that because less popular games have fewer recorded playthroughs available on YouTube or Twitch, it is harder to produce many imageplots of them to compare. Even if one sets out to produce their own recordings, there are still constraints of time and hard drive space that make it difficult to create many playthroughs to use. An additional challenge is finding complete playthroughs of a game that are not cut into smaller sections on YouTube, though one can get around this by splicing the smaller videos together into complete playthroughs for plotting. The length of a game is also potentially a limiting factor, as complete playthroughs of many games are significantly longer than the average playthrough of  <em>P.T.</em> , and take more time and computing resources to plot.</p>
<p>In order for the use and comparison of imageplots to be meaningful, careful attention to the type and source of the playthroughs that generate them is required. On the most basic level this means identifying exactly what the plotting of images is revealing regarding the relationship between data points. To put it another way, ImagePlot is capable of generating very interesting imageplots that contain very little meaning and insight for the analysis of the object they are plotting. An imageplot of the brightness and hue of a game reveals very little about that game’s narrative structure, and likewise an imageplot of time yields only the most basic observations of color usage in a game. Thus one must ensure that what one plots with ImagePlot matches the questions they are asking. This project focuses on questions of narrative variation in games, so the imageplots included here all deal with time, signs, and narrative structure. I have chosen not to plot the games according to qualities like hue, saturation, or brightness because all of the playthroughs being plotted are of the same games, so plotting those qualities would yield similar (if not identical) results.</p>
<p>The imageplots that result from this process are distance visualizations of players’ playthroughs of a particular game, and as such they effectively provide an archive of player experiences in that game. When looking at an imageplot of a playthrough, one can see everything that a player did in that game from start to finish. This means one can see both the player’s choices and actions, and the game system and environments in which they took place. Imageplots are thus excellent examples of archives as Foucault defines them: as  “the general system of the formation and transformation of statements”  and  “the system that governs the appearance of statements as unique events”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. The archive as  “system”  is key to Foucault’s understanding here; it is the system that actually produces the objects it contains. In terms of the  <em>P.T.</em>  imageplots of this project, the archive is the system of the game and the player: together they fashion the player’s experiences, encounters, and interactions (their statements) with images while playing. Plotting these images creates distance visualizations that are objects of the archive: they are produced by the game system, and also record that system’s possibilities.</p>
<p>Conceptualizing the imageplots of  <em>P.T.</em>  playthroughs as archival objects helps clarify their relationship to the game and their significance for analysis, but it does not explain how they function. In order to understand how imageplots operate and capture play, one can consider them as diagrams, drawing on the idea of the diagram as explained by Deleuze in his reading of Foucault. Deleuze quotes Foucault in saying that a diagram is more than an image, it is  “a functioning, abstracted from any obstacle,”    “a map, a cartography,”    “a machine that is almost blind and mute,”  and  “a spatio-temporal multiplicity”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. In essence, to Deleuze and Foucault a diagram is a frozen image that still contains motion and possibility in their purest, most ideal (and thus stillest) forms. Imageplots of game playthroughs are static images, yet they are images of play — they are snapshots of a system in operation, and evidence of that system’s potential. As such, they constitute diagrams of play. Each imageplot maps out a play experience with all of its movement and variation, yet the recording and plotting of images arrests and captures these same forces. The overall diagram of a given game is constantly changing according to the player, and yet the archive of the game imposes limits on this variation as well. Within this conceptual framework, this project is a construction of an archive of diagrams that contain the multiplicity of play possibilities, and that thus enable a tracing of the limits of interactivity and emergence in a game’s narrative and play.</p>
<p>ImagePlot provides a new methodology for assessing play experiences on a scale previously impossible. The imageplots of  <em>P.T.</em>  demonstrate how this method works, and what we can learn from it about narrative form.</p>
<h2 id="variance-in-time">Variance in Time</h2>
<p>While there are many types of variance between the playthroughs that emerge in the imageplots, the observable differences in narrative form between playthroughs fall into two broad categories. The first type of variability is variance in time, measured in both the duration of particular content in a game and in points in time when an individual player reaches a specific part of the game. The different times of the playthroughs reveal how their respective players engage with  <em>P.T.</em> , including how factors like skill, experience, and intent specifically affect the playing of the game and the experience of the game’s narrative. Measuring time in a playthrough using Imageplot also reveals how variable the durations of particular game events are and establishes how long a portion of the narrative is for an average player.</p>
<p>In order to measure variation, however, one first needs something to measure from. The points of similarity and sameness between imageplots are therefore a crucial place to start, and thankfully they are also some of the most immediately apparent aspects of them. All of the playthrough imageplots are plotted to be the same size, regardless of the amount of overall time each one visualizes. In effect this means that an imageplot of a shorter playthrough, such as PT3 (00:29:44), is visually similar to a longer playthrough such as PT5 (00:51:11). While this effaces the visualization of exact time, it is helpful for the comparison of time relative to different overall playtimes. In other words, one can see that events happen at relatively the same place in the playthroughs of PT3 and PT5, even if they happen at different time markers because the two players took different amounts of time to finish the overall game. Establishing that relative sameness between playthroughs then enables the observation and analysis of the variance created by player interactivity. Furthermore, one can interpret the similarities between imageplots as the visualization of the game’s basic structure and narrative–the common foundation that the game provides and all players experience.</p>
<p>The most obvious example of variation in time in the playthroughs is the fact that every playthrough has a different overall playtime. Of the ten playthroughs plotted here, the longest one (PT10) has a playtime of 1:24:50, and the shortest one (PT9) is 0:20:00 long.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  At first glance there appears to be a wide discrepancy between the two that would indicate the possibility for almost infinite variation, but taken together with the other playthroughs some clear trends emerge. For example, the average time of all the playthroughs is 0:39:22, with a standard deviation of 00:18:12. This means that 67% of the playthroughs in this dataset fall between 00:21:10 and 00:57:34 in playtime, and that that range of time accounts for the majority of play experiences with  <em>P.T.</em>  Of course there is still the possibility for outliers of longer or shorter playtime (including PT9 and PT10 already mentioned), and the addition of more data would inevitably alter these numbers. Yet these playthroughs seem fairly representative of extent available playthroughs on YouTube and Twitch, and perhaps even of player experiences not present through those platforms. As such, data collected from these playthroughs reveals a measure of how player interactivity shapes playtime on average, which affects narrative time and experience in  <em>P.T.</em>  A player who spends more time in an area will have a fuller experience of that area, and likely uncover parts of the game narrative that a player who spends less time there might miss. In this way variance in time is intricately linked with variance in sign covered in the next section.</p>
<p>Beyond measuring the overall length of a playthrough, imageplots also indicate the specific times when players encounter different parts of a game. In  <em>P.T.</em>  the most prominent example of this is an iteration of the hallway that is tinted red and is common to every playthrough and corresponding imageplot (Figure 3). Even without measuring the exact time the player reaches this version of the hallway, the imageplots show that there is a general variance in the time different players do so. Most of the players reached this point at roughly halfway through their playthroughs, but imageplots PT2, PT6, and PT7 enter the red hallway closer to the end of the game. PT6 is especially noteworthy in this regard, and the brevity of the playthrough after the red hallway is surprising when compared to the overall playtime, which was actually longer than average (00:40:00). It may be that the player in PT6 was more familiar with the later parts of the game and was able to complete them quickly. In any case, PT2, PT6, and PT7 reveal that time in the later stages of  <em>P.T.</em>  is especially variable in ways that it is not in the first half of the game. This variance in playtime is actually significant in the narrative as well. The versions of the hallway found in the first half of the game are relatively stable in terms of time and space–there are no tints to the lighting, the player moves at normal speed, and overall experience is more realistic (to the extent that that is possible in a world with strange monsters and supernatural occurrences). Yet all of this changes as  <em>P.T.</em>  progresses, and the game’s space and time begin to break down in the sections where playtime becomes most variable. The imageplots thus reveal that the narrative themes of  <em>P.T.</em>  are present even on the levels of game structure and playtime. This supports the ludonarrative position that narrative and play are not readily separable in games, but rather that they are constantly interwoven in the experience of a game.</p>

<p>Potential explanations for the time differences between the playthroughs are found in the individual player’s level of experience with the game, their playstyle, and their intentions for recording their play experience. While it is difficult to account for all of these factors of player experience with a game without contacting them, the way the player describes their playthrough can provide some answers. Four of the  <em>P.T.</em>  playthroughs included here (PT1, PT3, PT4, PT6) have been labeled “Walkthroughs” by their players, indicating that they show viewers the correct way to play and complete the game. As a result, one can assume that these players have played the game before and know each part of it well enough to conduct the walkthrough. In contrast, the other six playthroughs are variations of the “Let’s Play” format on YouTube and Twitch, which usually has players playing a game for the first time for an audience (sometimes with commentary). The lack of player experience in Let’s Plays relative to Walkthroughs means that playtimes in the former are on average longer, though not drastically so: the average playtime for the six Let’s Plays was 0:41:45, and the average for Walkthroughs was 0:35:47, with a difference between them of 0:05:58. These numbers indicate that while experience and intention do have an effect on variation in playtime, they alone do not fully explain it. The relatively small difference between Walkthroughs and Let’s Plays also may suggest that there is a central narrative and experience to a game that averages can help trace.</p>
<p>Experience and intention are by no means the only possible explanations of time variation, but unfortunately imageplots do not (and cannot) account for all factors. For example, players in different playthroughs may have been distracted by other things happening in their personal environments while playing, thus delaying their progress. Some players also may have more experience with different games that are similar to  <em>P.T.</em> , making them more familiar with the game’s conventions and better able to navigate them. Finally, players also may have played with different hardware setups that could subtly lengthen or shorten their playtime (this is especially common with older games like  <em>Silent Hill 2</em> ). These and other possibilities do not appear directly in the imageplots, and because of this it is impossible to account for them without additional information. Future work with ImagePlot and playthroughs could remedy this with more direct contact with players, or by adding methods for analyzing the images from player cameras found in some playthroughs.</p>

        <p>SHD1, an imageplot of a playthrough of <em>Silent Hill: Downpour</em> .
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Imageplots of another game in the Silent Hill franchise,  <em>Silent Hill: Downpour</em>  (Vatra Games, 2012), provide useful comparisons, both to other games in the series and to games with more room for exploration than  <em>P.T.. Silent Hill: Downpour</em>  was advertised as containing discoverable and variable content, largely to promote its replayability. The imageplots of  <em>Downpour</em>  are of very different playthroughs: SHD1 is a regular playthrough of the game with a playtime of 4:59:19, and SHD2 is a speedrun (where players attempt the shortest playtime possible) with a playtime of 2:52:20 (Figure 4). Interestingly, the two imageplots reveal fewer points of relative comparison between the playthroughs than with  <em>P.T.</em> , indicating that there is much more time variance in more open games like  <em>Downpour</em> . Presumably this is due to the presence of more content, meaning differences in playstyle will accumulate greater time differences by the end of the game. More importantly, this demonstrates how it is more difficult to locate a central narrative and player experience in longer games with more choices and player interactivity. It is not that a central narrative is not present, but rather that that central narrative is spread out and potentially obfuscated by the multiplicity of optional content interwoven with it. As seen in the imageplots, the narrative diffuses across the variability created by player interactivity, and the measures of variance in playtime (average, standard deviation, etc.) become looser as a result.</p>
<p>The durations and times captured by the imageplots are the results of thousands of moments of gameplay, and each moment presents the possibility for at least slightly different choices and actions on the part of the player. In this sense, the temporality of the imageplots is directly related to the multiplicity of emergent possibilities that are present in gameplay, and now captured in distance visualization. This suggests that the temporality of game narrative and play is inextricable from its emergent capabilities, similar to the temporality of cybernetics and neural nets described by Orit Halpern. Halpern writes, “the temporality of the net is preemptive, it always operates in the future perfect tense, but without necessarily defined endpoints or contexts. Nets are about T+1” [Halpern 2014, loc 3114]. Time in systems like nets or games operates on sets of uncertain future conditions, meaning that each moment in a game opens on new possibilities for emergence and alteration. The accumulation of these moments as seen in the imageplots accounts for measurable differences in time between playthroughs. They also involve the second category of difference: variance in content, or sign.</p>
<h2 id="variance-in-sign">Variance in Sign</h2>
<p>Beyond encountering objects at different times or in different places, players can also simply encounter different objects. There are several prominent examples of this in the  <em>P.T.</em>  playthroughs, including encounters that are similar (like the red hallway already mentioned), those that are similar and different (every player encounters a crash screen, but there are different crash screens), and those that are entirely different (such as a jump scare only some players encounter). The presence or absence of these events in a playthrough alters a player’s experience of the game, including their perception of the game’s narrative. I refer to these differing experiences of content as variance in sign because they involve the presence, absence, or rearranging of visual, auditory, and haptic signs that affect the game’s narrative.</p>
<p>While the red hallway, the crash screen, and the jump scare could each be fruitful moments for close analysis, I will only cover them briefly here for their significance to narrative structure and variance in games.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  The red hallway is perhaps the most immediately apparent similarity between all of the  <em>P.T.</em>  playthroughs, and the imageplots reveal that it varies more in its location in time than it does in its form. This does not mean that its form is not significant––if anything it means quite the opposite. The form and meaning of the red hallway are crucial to the progression of the story, as evidenced in the fact that every player must encounter it. The red hallway is where the reality of  <em>P.T.</em> ’s game world begins to bend and break, evident in how time speeds up in that version of the hallway and many of the normal objects are replaced with abstract and nightmarish versions of themselves. For example, all of the paintings and family pictures in the red hallway are replaced with images of flashing and revolving lights. This warping of the game’s reality is crucial to the central narrative of the game and its conclusion: as the player discovers more and more about a series of grisly murders, their first-person experience of the game’s environments becomes increasingly unstable, representing a growing psychosis. The red hallway is a breaking point in this process, and every player must encounter it in much the same way.</p>
<p>The imageplots demonstrate how the game seems to return to normal after the red hallway by presenting players a brightly lit version of the hallway. However the player quickly notices that the screen seems to break and glitch as they move around, and eventually the game seems to crash. Every player encounters the crash screen, indicating its significance as a moment of complete breakage in the game’s reality. Yet the type, color, and message of the crash screen varies, including red, yellow, white, and black versions of the screen seen in PT9, PT7, and PT2 (Figure 5. The black version in PT9 can be hard to distinguish from the other dark images of the imageplots without zooming in). The variance in the crash screen’s form introduces the possibility for different meaning and interpretation depending on the version the player encounters. Examples of the message on the screen include  “I’m heading there [to hell] now,”    “Development halted due to inexplicable bug,”  and  “I’ll call later.”  Which screen the player sees alters the meaning of the central narrative, creating a story of paranormal horror, a metafiction about game development, an unresolved mystery caller, or other potential interpretations.</p>

<p>Finally, some occurrences are limited to individual experiences, and are different on every playthrough of a game. For example, the player in  <em>P.T.</em>  is haunted throughout the game by Lisa, the ghost of a murdered wife from the radio reports that the player hears. However the encounters with Lisa are randomly generated, and there is a jump scare where Lisa attacks the player character and breaks their neck that only some players experience (occurring roughly half way through PT6). If this happens to a player, that player must start the entire cycle of looping hallways over again. The addition of these signs serves the same function as most jump scares: to frighten the player with sudden action. Yet they also alter the game’s narrative by changing the individual experience of the player, introducing elements of failure and becoming trapped in the seemingly endless hallway. Rather than being entirely secondary or separate, the variance of even a small number of optional and random signs can significantly affect a game’s central narrative.</p>
<p>The differences in signs between the playthroughs and imageplots of  <em>P.T.</em>  reveal the especially performative and playful nature of signs in games, which contributes to the overall mutability of narrative form in the medium. Each image or object in a game is a sign that the player interacts with–receiving it, interpreting it, deploying it, altering it, etc. This understanding is not new; C.S. Pierce recognized a similar interactivity with signs in identifying what he calls the  “interpretant”  of a sign, a mirror sign created in the mind of an individual encountering a sign <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Yet visual signs such as those found in games function somewhat differently from linguistic signs, and they operate by what Johanna Drucker calls distinct  “basic codes of visual form”   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. Drucker describes these basic codes as forms such as lines, shapes, and movement, and all of these are certainly present in games <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. Games are their own visual form, however, and their visual signs have media-specific codes as well. For example, objects in games are often marked by specific game symbols or highlighting to notify the player that the object is interactive. Similarly, the layout of space and objects can give players visual cues for where to go and what to do there, or in other words how to play. These visual signs are basic codes particular to games and are essential to how players navigate and play with game narrative. ImagePlot is capable of capturing the various outcomes or traces of these codes and players’ interactions with them, and in this sense an imageplot is itself an indexical sign of player activity in game. The relationship between an imageplot and player activity is indicative of how visual signs in games are often directly linked to functional purposes, and interacting with them during gameplay is a performance of meaning with variable and emergent outcomes.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The visual and playful signs present in an imageplot become further legible with the help of film semiotics. Film scholars such as Jean Mitry have theorized the relationship between visual and linguistic signs since the 1980s and have noted that different types of signs can have similar structures while functioning differently:  “any likeness exists in the structures not in the forms”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Just as there are important differences between signs in film and language, there are also differences between signs in film and signs in games. One such difference is the fact that the player takes on an active role in the construction of signs in games. With  <em>P.T.</em> , for example, it is up to the player to interpret the signs in the game and interact with them in the correct ways and sequences in order to progress. Because different players perform this role differently, there is variance in time and sign between imageplots of the same game when there isn’t for imageplots of the same film. Christian Metz’s concept of the  “imaginary signifier”  further explains the player’s role and presence in the imageplots. In short, in film the imaginary signifier is the transparent or absent signifier that nonetheless represents the viewer in the film, acting as their  “prosthesis for [their] primally dislocated limbs”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. A similar phenomenon takes place with player characters in games, particularly first person games like  <em>P.T.</em> , where the camera mimics the player’s first person experience of reality and the player character is not shown on screen. The physical embodiment of the player is nowhere represented in an imageplot, yet their presence in the form of their choices, actions, and encounters are ever-present. In this sense, the imaginary signifier of the player is the first person perspective, and it is found in every image plotted in the imageplots.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest insight film semiotics can lend to games and imageplot analysis is how signs and narratives are fundamentally fragmented, even as they give the illusion of being unified and complete. Film semiotics suggests that visual signs are fragmentary in the sense that they are always temporary and incomplete, lacking an actual referent and becoming distributed across images and time. Peter Wollen notes this in describing film as the  “fragments of raw reality, multiple and equivocal in themselves”   <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. The meaning of this fragmentation has profound implications for game narrative in that perfectly unitary narrative becomes elusive if not impossible. Imageplots reveal how signs in games are always fragmented and distributed across the overall experience of the game depending on player interactivity; players encounter, interpret, and sequence signs differently. As they do so, they generate similar but different realities, and in every moment of play there is the potential for difference to emerge. Importantly, the variability of signs and narratives in games does not render them ineffectual or secondary to play, but rather demonstrates how they are omnipresent and necessary to the construction of meaning in games. Metz emphasizes the crucial function of signs when he writes,  “Nevertheless, it is in [the symbolic’s] wake that we can find hope for a little more knowledge, it is one of its avatars that introduces  understanding ”   <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. ImagePlot helps us visualize how fragmentary signs come together in different configurations in play to create unique narrative realities, and film semiotics provides a framework for theorizing this process and its possibilities.</p>
<p>The play of game signs evident in imageplots reveals a crucial aspect of visual signs that they share with all other signs–as much as they are identifiable and understandable, they are never fully stable. As a visual sign enters into the virtual world and thus into play with other game signs of all sorts, it will continue to change and evolve in a way similar to the change over time Saussure describes in diachronic linguistics <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. One type of evolution in a game sign is formal, as a particular sign evolves according to player interaction and progress. An excellent example of this is the paper bag in the opening room of  <em>P.T.</em> , which over the course of the game goes from being a simple bag to being a narrator of sorts with a mouth. With each of its evolutions the form of the sign will change somewhat, and consequently the way the sign will be interpreted by the player and others will change as well. However such signs also change informally, in that their relationships to the player and to other game signs will constantly be in flux. There are limits to these changes; after all each game sign remains beholden to the other signs in its system, especially those that make up the central narrative and experience. Still, variance in sign means that narrative form in games is never static or fully stable.</p>
<p>Taken together, the signs in a game create the narrative of a player’s playthrough, and the presence or absence of particular signs can fundamentally alter that narrative. Variances in encountered signs constitute measurable differences in game narrative between playthroughs. Paying close attention to these points of semiotic difference allows one to trace the effects and magnitude of player interactivity in a given game.</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-and-playing-with-narrative-form">Visualizing and Playing with Narrative Form</h2>
<p>The archive of player experience created by imageplots allows for measures of variance in both time and sign in game analysis. There remain a number of limitations to this archive––for example, the imageplots cannot fully account for individual players’ embodied reactions to a game or exactly how they interpret game elements, though a future analysis of player actions and facial expressions caught on camera for Twitch streams (such as those found in PT8) may be able to move towards that capability. In sum, the strengths and weaknesses of this approach are:<br>
Strengths  Weaknesses      View entire playthrough in one image, can zoom in to see particular moments   Limited by available recorded playthroughs, or time and hardware in recording new ones       Compare many players’ experiences for similarities and differences   Does not capture players’ physical reactions or play environments       Identify patterns and trends, such as the overall narrative structure   Can be difficult to find patterns in longer games with much variation       See play as it happened, rather than what players remembered afterward   Impossible to know definitively why players did what they did without contacting them       Account for ludonarrative, the narrative and gameplay elements interwoven   Accounts only for what is present and recorded in the game, requires investigation of social and cultural contexts    <br>
Many of these weaknesses could be addressed through studies that recruit players to play a given game (or games) and record new playthroughs, controlling for play environment, player experience and intent, and other factors. Yet the advantage of the method as-is is that it captures a limited picture of how players are already playing on their own and experiencing ludonarrative.</p>
<p>What the imageplots already account for is a sense of the central narrative experience for each game, making it clearer which parts of a game are common to every player’s experience and which ones are specific to individual playthroughs. The central narrative of a game consists of these common parts, or in other words what the developers coded as the essential and necessary elements of the game’s characters, events, and overall world. In  <em>P.T.</em> , the imageplots reveal that the central narrative is found in the red hallway, the crash screen, and many copies of the hallway that are seemingly identical. Zooming in, one can see that the central narrative is told through documents and objects that all players interact with, and it is the scripted narrative of a man murdering his family and killing himself. It is not that the other parts of the game that are randomly generated or optional do not matter, or that they are not meaningful. Such parts are often still significant for altering or enhancing a game’s narrative, and they are crucial for building space for play and individual experience. Yet being able to distinguish between a game’s narrative core and its variable content allows for analyses that account for both the central narrative and for interactivity and specific differences in player experiences. It provides a way to record and trace the limits of player interactivity, and thus to assess where and how that interactivity leads to different interpretations and meanings for the game. These types of analysis are valuable to the study of games, ludonarrative, and other visual media for multiple reasons: they hone our focus on the types and effects of interactivity in games; they help us get more specific about similarity and difference between players’ experiences of a game and aid in the analysis of individual games as texts; they highlight new understandings of narrative; and they point to possibilities for playing and designing for difference in video game worlds.</p>
<p>The greater attention to variation and similarity in player experiences in imageplots furthers our understanding of interactivity in games by helping us see exactly where and how different games are interactive. While interactivity in games usually refers to the interaction between player and game, such as choosing what to do, what to use and interface with, and where to go in the virtual world, there are other types of interactivity present in games that become apparent in imageplots <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. For example, Daniel Punday argues that games are really a form of multimedia in that they are a point of interaction between many media, including music, film, and text <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. In this sense, media interact with each other as well as with people, particularly in automated ways enabled by software and digital networks. Narrative scholars such as Marie-Laure Ryan have identified similar forms of interactivity between different categories and aspects of games, such as the interaction of a game’s  “semiotic substance,”    “technical dimension,”  and  “cultural dimension”   <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. Players interact with game systems, other players, and even other media, and all of this takes place on various levels of physical or abstract interaction as forms collide, combine, and emerge. All of these processes are in different ways interactive, as Ryan argues:  “digital texts are like an onion made of different layers of skin, and that interactivity can affect different levels”   <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. Ludonarrative in games is dependent on these many forms of interactivity, including the interaction of different narratives, such as those laid out by developers, created by players, or that emerge in collective discourse inside or outside of a game <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. All of these types of narrative and interactivity are present in some way in imageplots: the narratives scripted into game content by developers (in  <em>P.T.</em> , the story of a man murdering his family) are seen in the objects in the images, the narratives players create themselves are observable in the sequence and duration of content they choose in their playthrough, and even some of the collective narratives that emerge from players interacting are discernible in the player’s webcam as they stream for an audience. Imageplots thus allow us to isolate how particular interactive and variable forms contribute to player experiences and meaning in specific moments throughout a game. They do so by providing observable measures of these effects — one can identify and examine how the player in PT1 played differently from the player in PT2, and how those differences change the reality of the game.</p>
<p>Imageplots make it possible to identify and get specific about variations in different players’ experiences with a game, such as my experience with  <em>P.T.</em>  that I narrated at the beginning of this article.  <em>P.T.</em>  ends with the phone in its hallway ringing and the player answering it, which shortly thereafter triggers a final cutscene that is a trailer for the cancelled  <em>Silent Hill</em>  game. I struggled to get the phone-ringing event to trigger, and as a result I spent a great deal of time in the final version of the hallway desperately trying possible solutions while hoping to avoid the randomly generated Lisa jump scare death event. The  <em>P.T.</em>  imageplots reveal that my experience, while shared with several other players (PT4, PT5, PT10), was not universal, and even seems to be in the minority of players’ experiences with the game. This difference in our playthroughs significantly alters the meaning and affect of the game’s ending. For most players, the ending is a short exploration of a familiar version of the hallway that constitutes an escape from the chaos of the preceding parts of the game. For me and other players who were trapped in the final hallway for greater amounts of time, the ending was a frantic, stressful scramble to find a way out before possibly dying and having to start over. Despite both experiences ending in the same place, the variance in time and sign profoundly affects the narrative pacing and structure, potentially even leading to divergent interpretations of the game’s messages and meanings.</p>
<p>Imageplots thus aid in the analysis of individual texts by allowing us to see the structure of an entire visual text at once, and to assess how that structure contributes to the text’s meanings. In other words, ImagePlot allows us to see the shape of a text, much the same way that sentiment analysis allowed Matthew Jockers to see the shape of plots in novels, that topic modeling allowed Ben Schmidt to identify fundamental plot arcs in popular TV shows, or comparing different plots across media allowed Chess to identify the queer potentials for narrative in the play spaces of games.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  Using imageplots of playthroughs, one clearly sees how long or short a segment of a game is, the colors and aesthetics used in different portions of a game, and what trends or cycles exist in the course of a game. For example, the imageplots of  <em>P.T.</em>  included here reveal the structure of the game’s narrative that contributes to its overall meanings and determines what all players will experience and what different players will experience differently. In particular, the imageplots demonstrate that every player will spend roughly the first half of the game exploring more or less similar versions of  <em>P.T.</em> ’s hallway, evidenced in the lighting and coloring of the images that remains the same throughout those sections of the game. However around halfway through their playthrough (more or less, depending on the player), the player will encounter a red version of the hallway that radically changes the player experience and sets off a descent into instability and incoherence in content that dominates much of the rest of the game (see imageplots). While the red hallway starts this for each player, the descent looks different for each player as well: they encounter different versions of the crash screen after the red hallway and randomly generated events from that point on. This structure is essential to the narrative of the game — the narrative of a man who wakes up with no memory of his surroundings, gradually discovers that a man murdered his family in the house, and confronts the growing terror that he might be that man. What is at first a casual, if cautious, exploration of a strange house gives way to the desperate attempt to escape an increasingly random, broken, nightmarish reality, and this narrative progression is visible in the game’s structure. Distance visualization allows us to see a game’s overall layout and plotting, and this perspective lends new evidence to game analysis that links close analysis of specific scenes to larger forms, structures, and patterns.</p>
<p>Beyond the analysis of individual texts, imageplots and distance visualization contribute to a ludonarrative understanding of narrative form that is nonlinear, emergent, and playful. Imageplots of games demonstrate the constant connection between narrative and play in that they show how the traditionally narrative elements are interwoven with segments of play. In other words, the  “cutscenes and backstories”  that game studies scholars such as Markku Eskelinen identify as the only narrative parts of a game still need play in order to connect them together into a narrative, and cannot be isolated or abstracted away from the player pushing them forward <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Even moments in  <em>P.T.</em>  where the player is simply moving down the hallway or looking at objects —the mundane actions that make up the majority of the  <em>P.T</em> . playthroughs and imageplots —are progressing toward the ultimate fulfillment of the narrative, and it seems arbitrary to completely divorce those moments from their narrative function. Instead of considering narrative as a linear or multilinear progression of events separate from gameplay, what if we considered narrative as a system of signs that coheres into a core experience, with variations in sign and time emerging and impacting that center? The crucial difference here is that narrative becomes less of a static and stable form, and more of an active, evolving, and mutable one. Hanna-Riika Roine argues for a similar definition of narrative by pointing out how narrative forms are affected by  “the participatory nature of digital media:”    “they now appear to us as phenomena to be cut, pasted, reassembled, and distributed”   <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Imageplots visualize these changing and colliding forms in games and other visual media, and help capture what narrative looks like as players and viewers experience it differently.</p>
<p>Exploring the collisions of many forms, structures, and semiotics in visualizations like imageplots can yield new insights on how ludonarrative texts operate and create multiplicities of meaning. This is not completely new work, and there have been calls for the use of semiotics in game studies, such as Paolo Ruffino’s work with semiotics and the social contexts of games, or Brian Upton’s work with the procedural generation of meaning in games.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  However we have yet to fully account for the immense multiplicity of forms and possibilities for variation in games, and there is still no consensus in game studies (particularly the emerging study of ludonarrative) as to a methodology for game analysis. ImagePlot makes it increasingly clear that ludonarrative in games relies on the complex interactivity of language and play to create both similarity and difference between player experiences. Yet how exactly game signs are formed, laden with meaning, and interpreted by players and developers in different contexts remain rich topics for further research, and ImagePlot is one method for conducting this research on a much greater scale than individual analyses of single playthroughs. Identifying the central narrative and using differences in time and sign to measure player interactivity is a starting point. It provides a few of the analytical tools needed for the theory and praxis of a critical, playful interpretation of games that can also account for player interaction and difference. But the ability to visualize a game’s forms, signs, and central narrative with ImagePlot also has many profoundly interdisciplinary implications and potential uses that are unexplored: imageplots could help assess where and how players spend time in games, which game mechanics and designs are helpful or harmful to player experiences, or how players learn and adapt through the course of a game, among many other questions. For example, the  <em>P.T.</em>  imageplots provide an archive of player experiences in a popular survival horror game, and they can help answer questions of how and why players engage in settings that create unease, fear, and even terror. In this sense, ludonarrative, semiotics, and the study of game forms can contribute to work in the other disciplines of game studies, even as it pursues its own projects.</p>
<p>By better understanding how forms operate in games through distance visualization and analysis, we can ultimately find ways to use them in the creation of new story worlds and even new realities. For example, Ryan argues that critical attention to interactivity can reveal how media form new spaces and experiences for players of games <sup id="fnref1:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. Alice Bell capitalizes on this observation and other parts of Ryan’s work to suggest that hypertext and interactive fictions (including games) constantly generate  “Possible Worlds”  that are  “ontological domains,”  and thus different spaces and conditions of being <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Players repeatedly choose, explore, or foreclose upon these possible worlds, and they do so by interacting with the changeable forms that comprise a game’s system and can be captured in imageplots.</p>
<p>Of course there are limits to which possible worlds can emerge that are largely tied to the limitations of our current systems. As Ryan writes,  “we do not really have a story-generating system sufficiently sophisticated to produce a wide variety of interesting stories out of data internal to the system”   <sup id="fnref2:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. A story system capable of adapting to any user input has long been the goal of game designers such as Chris Crawford, but even after decades of attempts such systems are only capable of generating basic procedural narratives. It might be that the creation of a fully interactive system can only happen once we have reassessed our understanding of forms ranging from signs to narratives and beyond, and developed computing, programming languages, game engines, and other assets for better utilizing variable and emergent forms like ludonarrative. ImagePlot and other digital humanities tools for visualization can help get us there by visualizing forms, and making it possible to compare how they collide, flow, and shift. In games, they reveal what emerges as the common core of a game’s possible worlds and establish what most possible worlds for a game will look like. In effect, they show us a game’s pieces, and how those pieces can relate to each other and to us. With that knowledge, we can envision how our interactions with a game — along with all of the variations they generate — could be different or better. Now let’s play.</p>

<p>In this essay we explore the process of textual normalization in the context of machine-assisted collation, which is a common operation in digital textual scholarship. Collation, that is, the alignment of versions of (traditionally called witnesses to) the same work, is used by scholars for studying the textual transmission or the genetic process of a work, often as a step in the preparation of a scholarly edition of that work. Machine-assisted collation refers to the use of computers for performing, in full or in part, this alignment. As such, it has a long history, as long as that of the Digital Humanities <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>: over the past sixty years, not only have the machines at our disposal changed, but so have scholars’ understanding of the collation process, and the most refined computational model of collation available today is the one devised in 2009 in Gothenburg by the developers of the collation software Juxta and CollateX and by the textual scholars of the COST Action Open Scholarly Communities on the Web and of the program Interedition <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The Gothenburg modular architecture for computer-assisted collation is a five-stage computational pipeline, in which  <strong>Normalization</strong>  constitutes the optional second stage, where it contributes to improving the alignment.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>In this essay we argue that normalization contributes not only to the alignment, but also to the interpretation of the texts. Furthermore, it occurs at several moments of the collation process, between transcription and rendering, and should not be regarded as happening all at once and only in one location. Our point is not to question the modeling of collation as a computational pipeline, which has led to impressive, productive, and influential results, but to explore the complexity that is elided in the simpler description of  <strong>Normalization</strong>  in the Gothenburg model, as well as the consequences of that complexity for conceptualizing and implementing a collation project. In fact, for reasons that we explore in detail below, an awareness of how pervasive normalization might be in machine-assisted collation is fundamental to devising a computational workflow that corresponds appropriately to the scholarly requirements of each project. The relationship between our understanding of normalization and our workflow is valid not only for researchers relying on (software that is organized according to) the Gothenburg model, but, more generally, as something to be taken into account by those dealing with machine-assisted collation. That is, the Gothenburg model offers a foundation for discussion, but our argument about the importance and ubiquity of normalization is not dependent on it. Furthermore, as often happens with the computational counterpart of a scholarly practice, machine-assisted collation tends to make explicit the assumptions implicit in manual collation: the study proposed here is largely applicable to collation in general, whether some operations are performed mentally or computationally. For this reason, the essay is addressed not only to textual scholars, but also to developers, who can find here a thorough analysis of the complex procedures implied in machine-assisted collation, with a particular focus on the different kinds of normalization that happen throughout the process.</p>
<p>The essay first lays out preliminary remarks about what normalization is, its manifold forms and purposes, and provides an overview of the Gothenburg model. That model supplies the architecture for what follows: for each stage of the model, the potential role of normalization is discussed and illustrated with examples. In the conclusions, we summarize how this study contributes to a reconsideration of both the role and significance of normalization in collation and digital textual scholarship and, more narrowly, of the Gothenburg model of machine-assisted collation.</p>
<h2 id="normalization">Normalization</h2>
<p>In the context of machine-assisted collation as formalized by the Gothenburg model, described below,  <strong>Normalization</strong>  refers to the creation and use of shadow copies of word tokens when performing alignment. A common and simple type of normalization is case-folding. For example, although cat and Cat are not string-equal, collation processing might create a lower-cased shadow copy of each word in the text before performing the comparisons needed for alignment. As a result, although the output might retain the original casing, the alignment engine would use the shadow copies for comparison, and would therefore recognize that the difference between cat and Cat is not significant for alignment purposes.</p>
<p>In this essay we use  <strong>Normalization</strong>  (capitalized and embolded) to refer to the second, optional, stage of the Gothenburg model, in which the differences in witness tokens that should be ignored for alignment purposes are neutralized, or normalized, prior to alignment. We use normalization (without special capitalization or other formatting) to refer to normalization as a general concept, present in many forms distributed over several stages of the pipeline, and affecting not only Stage 2 ( <strong>Normalization</strong> ), but also, in particular, Stage 0 ( <strong>Transcription</strong> ), Stage 1 ( <strong>Tokenization</strong> ), and Stage 4 ( <strong>Analysis</strong> ). The distinction is instrumental for the main argument of this essay, anticipated above, which is that normalization does not occur only at the  <strong>Normalization</strong>  stage, and it is, instead, pervasive in machine-assisted collation.</p>
<p>Normalization can be performed at different textual levels and it affects many types of textual variation. For example, in addition to the case-folding described above, researchers might wish to neutralize the  <strong>graphemic</strong>  distinction between Latin alphabet regular s (U+0073 LATIN SMALL LETTER S) and long ſ (U+017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S).  <strong>Orthographic</strong>  variation may also transcend the graphemic level, as in the orthographic distinction between US English color and British colour, or the logographic replacement, rooted in homonymy, of the English preposition to by the digit 2 in a telegraphic communicative style popular on social networks.  <strong>Morphological</strong>  variation includes differences in categories like tense, gender, number, and others; for example, a collation operation might want to recognize that different inflected forms of the same lexeme (such as English is and are, which have no characters in common) may be textual variants, and are therefore potential candidates for alignment.  <strong>Lexical</strong>  variants might be identified by semantic features; for example, if one manuscript witness reads books and magazines and another reads journals, we might want to align journals with magazines, rather than with books, because journals is semantically closer to magazines than it is to books. For multilingual alignment of witnesses in languages with greatly different orthographies (such as Greek [Greek script] and Old Church Slavonic [Glagolitic or Cyrillic script]), normalization might take the form of recording only the part of speech in the shadow copy, since in this research context, part of speech is a better predictor of the alignment of variants than any modification of the orthographic strings <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Normalization, in a nutshell, makes it possible to identify phenomena on multiple orthographic and linguistic levels and use them to create surrogates for the literal word tokens that then shape and interpret the results of collation, tacitly neutralizing and ignoring other distinctions that are present in the literal tokens. During the process of normalization, an original form is replaced (or, rather, shadowed, since the original form is typically retained and is available for use in the eventual rendered output) by a normalized form. The point of this deliberate neutralization is that different original forms that are normalized (or, in computational terms, that hash) to the same value are deemed to be the same at a certain point of the process of machine-assisted collation.</p>
<h2 id="machine-assisted-collation-the-gothenburg-model">Machine-assisted collation: the Gothenburg model</h2>
<p>Within a computational pipeline, the output of one process becomes the input to the next, much as water may flow through plumbing that is constructed by concatenating small pieces of piping <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  Under the Gothenburg model, the digitized text of each witness is piped first through  <strong>Tokenization</strong>  (Stage 1) and then through  <strong>Normalization</strong>  (Stage 2), at which point it is joined with all other witnesses to constitute the complex input into  <strong>Alignment</strong>  (Stage 3). The single output of  <strong>Alignment</strong>  is then piped through  <strong>Analysis</strong>  (Stage 4) and  <strong>Visualization</strong>  (Stage 5) to generate the eventual output of the collation operation. This is illustrated in Figure 1, below, where three witnesses are collated, and Stage 2 ( <strong>Normalization</strong> ) is highlighted in green.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

<p>The key contribution of the Gothenburg model to our understanding of collation is its modularization of the process in a way that facilitates customization<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  and is agreed upon by a community of users.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  Instead of a monolithic black box that ingests witness input and extrudes a collation as a single process (that is, a degenerate pipeline with a single step), a collation system built according to the Gothenburg model, such as CollateX, can expose hooks that support developer intervention at any stage of the process without a need to interact explicitly with the other stages. For example, a user can replace the default CollateX  <strong>Normalization</strong>  with a customized alternative (see below) without having to touch (or, for the most part, even know about) the implementation of the other Gothenburg stages. As long as the input and output format of each stage is documented, replacing a step in the pipeline is an autonomous operation, that is, one that does not require accommodation elsewhere in the system. In this report we rely for illustrative examples on CollateX, which may be considered the reference implementation of the Gothenburg model.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>This essay challenges the characterization of normalization in the Gothenburg model as something that happens in a single location in the chain of processes (at Stage 2, called  <strong>Normalization</strong> ). Instead, as we illustrate below, normalization may be performed in four different stages within the overall collation process, not only to improve the alignment, but also to annotate the sources with a layer of information that may be vital for subsequent analysis. In the following description of the five stages of the Gothenburg model (preceded by  <strong>Transcription</strong> , which we call Stage 0), the notation (n) after the section heading means that normalization plays a role in the stage.</p>
<h2 id="stage-0-transcription-for-the-purpose-of-collation-n">Stage 0. Transcription for the purpose of collation (n)</h2>
<p>Except in the case of born-digital character-based data, witnesses to be input into a collation engine must first be digitized, that is, transcribed, whether manually or with machine assistance (e.g., OCR). In the case of handwritten documents, this transcription entails the conversion of an analog original to a digital character-stream surrogate. This transcription necessarily is not a one-to-one mapping because the handwritten analog original is infinitely variable, while the distinct character types in the digital result are limited by the character inventory. In practice, the level of detail in the transcription (that is, the extent to which it is diplomatic) depends on the goals and purposes of the edition, and for that reason,  “transcripts are best judged on how useful they will be &hellip;, rather than as an attempt to achieve a definitive transcription”   <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Furthermore, Robinson and Solopova continue, because the complete character representation of all features on a handwritten original is both impossible and undesirable, transcriptions  “must be seen as fundamentally incomplete and fundamentally interpretative”   <sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The conflation of multiple physically different written signs into the same single digital characters is an instance of normalization, that is, of determining, sometimes subconsciously, that certain objective differences may (or, perhaps, should) be ignored because they are not relevant informationally.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  The risk of normalization during manual transcription, though, is that information that is discarded during transcription is not available at later stages of collation, or during subsequent use of the collation output in research. Researchers are nonetheless comfortable with this type of normalization not only because it is inevitable, for the reasons described above, but also because they are confident that the data that they are excluding is not informational. The alternative, that is, trying to transcribe with as little normalization as possible, not only cannot be perfect, but also comes at a cost, because the greater the number of graphic distinctions the researcher tries to preserve during transcription, the greater the price in terms of both efficiency (because the researcher must be alert to more details) and accuracy (because there is more opportunity for distraction, error, and inconsistency) <sup id="fnref2:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. A sensible compromise, especially in situations where photographic facsimiles are available, and therefore reduce the documentary value of a  <em>hyperdiplomatic</em>  transcription, is that the digital transcription should preserve differences in the original orthography that might be needed for adequate rendering (as determined by the goals of the project) or serve as eventual input into computational analysis (which might include alignment within the collation process, subsequent analysis of patterns of variation, or orthographic or linguistic analysis that is not connected explicitly to collation).<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Normalization during transcription need not be entirely silent. For example, as a way of accommodating both diplomatic and normalized representations during transcription, the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) makes it possible to couple the two formally where that is sensible and practical, as in the following example from the TEI P5 Guidelines:<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This strategy makes it possible, outside a collation context, to index or search for words according to their normalized forms while rendering them according to the variant orthography that appears in the source. It is nonetheless the case that even the  <code>&lt;orig&gt;</code>  reading necessarily undergoes some degree of normalization as part of the transcription process.</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-tokenization-n">Stage 1. Tokenization (n)</h2>
<p>The alignment of segments of text for collation presupposes the division of a single continuous stream of characters into tokens, typically words (however we define them) and punctuation marks, although nothing precludes other forms of tokenization.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  CollateX, for example, incorporates a default tokenization function that splits the input into sequences of word characters (regex  <code>\w+</code> ) plus any trailing whitespace (regex  <code>\s+</code> ), and further breaks off punctuation marks together with any trailing whitespace into their own tokens (regex  <code>\W+</code> ). In this way, for example, a word followed by a period at the end of a sentence will be recognized as string-equal to the same word without the period in a different witness.</p>
<p>How to manage whitespace, which is one of the common issues that must be resolved during tokenization, might also entail forms of normalizations. Although tokenization on whitespace in some other programming contexts (such as the XPath  <code>tokenize()</code>  function or the Python  <code>str.split()</code>  method with a null separator value) may regard whitespace as a separator between tokens that should be discarded, default tokenization in CollateX, for example, keeps the whitespace as the trailing part of the preceding token, so that nothing is discarded during tokenization.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  This whitespace is subsequently removed in CollateX by the default  <strong>Normalization</strong>  stage unless that is overridden (see the following section), thus preserving the strict Gothenburg model distinction between  <strong>Tokenization</strong>  and  <strong>Normalization</strong> . Yet regarding all whitespace characters as equivalent for tokenizing the input, and regarding sequences of multiple whitespace characters as equivalent to a single space, both of which are part of the default implementation of  <strong>Tokenization</strong>  in CollateX, are forms of normalization, that is, situations where forms that are not string-equal are nonetheless deemed to be equivalent for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>Thanks to the modular architecture of the Gothenburg model adopted by CollateX, which provides hooks into the  <strong>Tokenization</strong>  stage, users can replace the default  <strong>Tokenization</strong>  with custom code without needing to know about or otherwise touch the code that manages the other stages of processing.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  For example, where punctuation is not intended to be used in alignment but must nonetheless remain available in the final output, it is possible to tokenize only on sequences of whitespace characters, regarding punctuation not as a separate token, but as part of the word token that precedes or follows it, where it can then be ignored (during Stage 2) for the alignment (during Stage 3).</p>
<h2 id="stage-2-normalization-n">Stage 2. Normalization (n)</h2>
<p>The Gothenburg model regards  <strong>Normalization</strong>  primarily as a way of improving Alignment by recognizing that tokens that are not string-equal should nonetheless be deemed to be equivalent for the purpose of  <strong>Alignment</strong> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It might suffice to normalize the tokens’ textual content such that an exact matching of the normalized content yields the desired equivalence relation. For instance, in many cases all tokens of the text versions are normalized to their lower-case equivalent before being compared, thereby making their comparison case insensitive. Other examples would be the removal of punctuation, the rule-based normalization of orthographic differences or the stemming of words.<br>
<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> As implemented within CollateX, a token is a complex object that contains at least two properties: a t (text) property, which represents the string value of the token after  <strong>Tokenization</strong> , and an n (normalized) property, which represents the result of applying  <strong>Normalization</strong>  to the t value. The software uses agreement among the n properties to recognize tokens that should be aligned. The t and n values are created either by the built-in default  <strong>Tokenization</strong>  and default  <strong>Normalization</strong>  operations,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  or by custom operations implemented by the researcher to replace the defaults. The fact that each token has the t and n properties means that CollateX exposes the output of  <strong>Tokenization</strong>  alongside the output of  <strong>Normalization</strong> , providing hooks for customization that make the software useful for scholars with a wide variety of editorial requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Normalization</strong>  at Stage 2 in the Gothenburg process serves a specific purpose: it is performed so that variation that the editor considers unimportant for alignment will not influence Stage 3, when  <strong>Alignment</strong>  is performed.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  This is different from the purpose of normalization during  <strong>Transcription</strong>  (which we called Stage 0, above) or during  <strong>Analysis</strong>  (Stage 4, below), and it has different consequences. If the editor normalizes the text during  <strong>Transcription</strong>  and does not record the non-normalized forms, those forms become irretrievable.  <strong>Normalization</strong>  at Stage 2 of the Gothenburg model, however, is non-destructive, since the normalized form is created as a shadow copy of the original, and not as a replacement for it. As Bleeker explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>normalization in the context of automated collation is not equivalent to normalization that happens in transcription. For example, editors can transcribe orthographic variation because they consider it important to be preserved in both the transcription and the collation output. However, in the collation process itself, they may want to normalize orthographic variation because they do not want it to influence the alignment. In that case they need to normalize their tokens before inputting them in the collation software.<br>
<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Common types of normalization, some of which were mentioned in the introduction, above, are discussed individually in the subsections below. Many of these examples might have been aligned correctly even without normalization because of forced matches, near-matching (see below), or — in situations where the software can decide only arbitrarily among alternatives — by chance.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  But because of the computational complexity of alignment, normalization that leads to the identification of more exact matches (of the normalized shadows of the tokens) can nonetheless improve both the accuracy and the efficiency of the overall performance.</p>

These tokens would have been aligned correctly in any case because they constitute a forced match between Mrs. and England. But the information stored and processed during the  <strong>Normalization</strong>  stage is available not only for  <strong>Alignment</strong> , but also, for example, for distinguishing, during subsequent  <strong>Analysis</strong> , forced matches that are not deemed equivalent from those that are.</p>
<h2 id="graphemic-orthographic">Graphemic (orthographic)</h2>
<p>In early Cyrillic writing, з (U+437 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER ZE) and ѕ (U+0455 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER DZE) had different pronunciations and distribution in Old Church Slavonic, but came to be used largely interchangeably in early East Slavic writing, including in the  <em>Rus′ primary chronicle</em> .<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  In the last column in the following example from that work (4,8), the Xle witness uses one variant and other witnesses agree on the other, and the editors neutralize the distinction at the  <strong>Normalization</strong>  stage, so that the forms will be deemed equivalent for purposes of  <strong>Alignment</strong> :<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup><br>

<h2 id="spelling-orthographic">Spelling (orthographic)</h2>
<p>The 1818 and 1823 editions of Mary Shelley’s  <em>Frankenstein</em>  regularly use the US-associated spelling of the verbal suffix -ize, while the 1831 edition regularly uses the British-associated spelling -ise. In the  <em>Frankenstein variorum</em>  Project, this distinction can be neutralized before performing  <strong>Alignment</strong> , as in the case of tranquillize and tranquillise in the seventh token column in the following example.<br>
Spelling variation in the  <em>Frankenstein variorum</em>  Project    Witness   Tokens       1818  for  nothing  contributes  so  much  to  tranquillize  the  mind      1823  for  nothing  contributes  so  much  to  tranquillize  the  mind      1831  for  nothing  contributes  so  much  to  tranquillise  the  mind   <br>
The same phenomenon can be observed in the following example, from the  <em>Lancelot</em>  manuscript transmission <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>, where Witness A preserves an archaic spelling and Witnesses B and C reflect the modern one:<br>

When CollateX fails to find an exact string match during Alignment and there are multiple options for placing a token (in this case, ge may be placed in the first or second token column), the software arbitrarily defaults to the leftmost position, which, in the example above, is philologically incorrect.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  But by normalizing the two different spellings of the pronoun, ge in Witness A is aligned correctly:<br>

The  <em>Rus′ primary chronicle</em>  manuscripts illustrated above vary orthographically for reasons that are both properly orthographic (that is, concerned with scribal conventions for writing correctly) and underlyingly phonetic (insofar as the manuscripts were written at different times, they do not all represent the same state of the language). Identifying all individual neutralizations of letter differences for normalization is not practical because of the complexity of the systems and their relationships to one another. It is, however, possible to overcome this limitation with a normalization scheme that retains only the parts of the tokens that have a high information load with respect to grouping readings into variant sets. For this project we implemented a normalization scheme based on a modification of Soundex <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>, recognizing that, in these writing systems, the beginning of the word has a higher information load than the end, consonants have a higher information load than vowels, and some phonetic distinctive features have a higher information load than others.

<h2 id="digits-orthographic">Digits (orthographic)</h2>
<p>The distinction between numbers spelled as digits and those spelled as words may be neutralized for alignment purposes. The following example is from the  <em>Rus′ primary chronicle</em>  (1,2), where, in the fourth token column, Ost uses an Arabic numeral; Rad, Aka, and Ipa use a Cyrillic letter to represent a numerical value, followed by a grammatical ending; and the other witnesses spell out the entire number as a word (a different number in Lav than in the others).<br>

<h2 id="punctuation-orthographic">Punctuation (orthographic)</h2>
<p>If what is important to the researcher is to distinguish simply the presence or absence of punctuation, but not the form it takes, different punctuation tokens may be neutralized as a single, generic punctuation token. If punctuation is treated during tokenization as part of the word that precedes it, the punctuation marks may be compared literally, as they appear in the manuscripts, in which case, for example, a word followed by a comma will not match the same word followed by a dot. Alternatively, trailing punctuation can be normalized so as to be ignored during alignment, as in the example below from the  <em>Rus′ primary chronicle</em> . Here in the fourth token column the Rad and Xle readings differ not only in the second letter, but also in the trailing punctuation, which is a dot in Rad and a comma in Xle:<br>

<h2 id="morphological-linguistic">Morphological (linguistic)</h2>
<p>Morphological variation (e.g., inflectional endings that express number, gender, case, tense, and other linguistic categories) may be neutralized before  <strong>Alignment</strong> , similarly to what in corpus linguistics is called lemmatization or stemming. In the following example the present (Witness A) and future (Witnesses B and C) tense of the verb chevaucher (to ride) might be normalized in order to obtain an optimal alignment.<br>
Morphological variation in  <em>Lancelot en prose</em>     Witness   Tokens       A  que  ge  chevauchoie  -  a  tot  mon  poir      B  que  je  chevalcheroie  -  a  tot  mon  pooir      C  si  -  chevalcheroie  la  a  tot  mon  pooir</p>
<h2 id="lexical-linguistic">Lexical (linguistic)</h2>
<p>In Old French, pas and mie are negative particles that are used together with the negation adverb ne. They have no textual characters in common, but their meaning and syntactic pattern of use is the same, making them candidates for alignment. In the following example, the alignment would be sub-optimal without a normalization of the two forms, because mie would be placed into the fourth token column, aligned with on in Witness B, instead of in the fifth, aligned with pas.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  If normalization is performed, the alignment is correct, as reflected in the table below:<br>

<p>Consider the following hypothetical alignment example from the CollateX development test suite:<br>
Example of texts to be aligned    Witness   Untokenized text       A   I bought this glass because it matches those plates.      B  I bought those glasses.   <br>
Alignment according to exact orthographic matching would align the two instances of those, producing:<br>
Problematic alignment of the example in Table 10    Witness   Tokens       A  I  bought  this  glass  because  it  matches  those  plates.      B  I  bought            those  glasses.   <br>
Some editors, though, might prefer to align the direct objects, that is, to assign greater weight to the syntactic role than to string matching. This would produce:<br>
Preferable alignment of the example in Table 10    Witness   Tokens       A  I  bought  this  glass  because  it  matches  those  plates.      B  I  bought  those  glasses.</p>
<h2 id="language-linguistic">Language (linguistic)</h2>
<p>In this section a segment of text from the Old Church Slavonic (OCS)  <em>Codex Suprasliensis</em>  is aligned with a reconstructed Greek parallel text. Because the two languages use different scripts, no type of orthographic normalization would improve string matching, but when a part of speech identifier is used as the shadow normalization property of the tokens, it allows for quite accurate alignment. In the following example, the second gap in the OCS is aligned with a Greek definite article because Greek has articles and OCS does not. The first gap reflects the presence of a personal pronoun in the Greek that happens not to be in the OCS. The tokens that are aligned in the two witnesses belong, pairwise, to the same parts of speech, which is how CollateX knew where to position the gaps <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.<br>

<h2 id="stage-3-alignment">Stage 3. Alignment</h2>
<p>No normalization is performed during the  <strong>Alignment</strong>  stage of the Gothenburg model, but the alignment engine has access to the results of the normalization performed in the  <strong>Normalization</strong>  stage, as well as the less explicit normalization, described above, that happens during  <strong>Transcription</strong>  and  <strong>Tokenization</strong> . And, as is explained below, because the output of  <strong>Analysis</strong>  (Stage 4) can be cycled back into another iteration of  <strong>Alignment</strong> ,  <strong>Alignment</strong>  also may have access to normalization performed during  <strong>Analysis</strong> .</p>
<p>The input into the  <strong>Alignment</strong>  stage of CollateX is a set of token sequences, one sequence for each witness, where, as described above, each token has a t property, which represents a transcription of its reading according to the witness, and an n property, which represents a normalized version of the t property.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  As described above, Normalization is not limited to orthography; the researcher may create, as the n property, any surrogate for the token that will facilitate alignment. The alignment engine then uses only the n property to try to find the best alignment of the tokens, that is, the alignment that corresponds most closely to what a human philologist would produce.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Alignment is, to be sure, a more complicated process than simply aligning the tokens with matching n values. On the one hand, in a text of any meaningful length, word tokens are likely to repeat, which means that alignment must associate the correct instances of each value, evaluating and making decisions about many-to-one or many-to-many correspondences. For example, in the following alignment table:<br>
Correct alignment of repeated word token la    Witness   Tokens       A  la  ou  il  conquist  par  sa  chevalerie      B    ou  il  conquist  la  grant  hautesce      C  la  ou  il  conquist  la  grant  hatece   <br>
“la” (token columns 1 and 5) occurs once each in witnesses A and B (in different locations) and twice in witness C. The alignment engine matches these instances correctly because, although it operates at a certain level with individual tokens, it also knows about sequences of vertically aligned blocks. This means that it has access to the context when deciding which instances of repeated tokens in one witness to align with which instances of matching tokens in the others.</p>
<p>Repetition (that is, the occurrence of multiple instances of the same token) is a well-known challenge for collation, and Andrews (2020) proposes an unusual normalization strategy as a way of meeting that challenge. Andrews observes that when a computational process aligns very common words because they are string-equal, they often do not belong to corresponding textual units, which both produces misalignments and increases the computation complexity of the collation process:<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Common readings keep being treated as equivalent, just because they are identical! This often throws off the collation of more substantive words, because the collator doesn’t know how to tell what is substantive or not. In a long text with many witnesses, this can throw off a collation [&hellip; and &hellip;] the collation algorithm was taking longer and longer.<br>
<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> To avoid the spurious alignment of tokens that, although string-equal, are so common that their correspondence is more likely to be accidental than philologically meaningful, Andrews replaces these common tokens, as well as punctuation tokens, with random strings during  <strong>Normalization</strong> . As a consequence of this random replacement, the normalized surrogates do not agree with anything during  <strong>Alignment</strong> , and therefore do not complicate or confuse that process. This enables substantive agreements to govern the alignment, improving both the quality of the output and the speed of the operation (Andrews reports that it  “made the process run 4–5 times faster” ).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the alignment engine may also choose to align non-matching tokens that fall in the same position, as in the fourth position in the example below.<br>
Forced match in the alignment    Witness   Tokens       A  lors  abat  la  destre  manicle  de  son  hauberc      B  lors  abat  la  senestre  manicle  de  son  hauberc      C  lors  abat  la  senestre  manicle  de  son  hauberc   <br>
The token alignment in seven of the eight columns reflects exact string equality across all witnesses, but destre (right) and senestre (left), in the fourth token column, are not an exact match. This alignment is forced by the context: given that the la tokens before and the manicle tokens afterwards are aligned as exact matches in all witnesses, the tokens between them fall into alignment by default, a situation we call a forced match.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>    <strong>Alignment</strong>  is further complicated by token transposition, where tokens in one order in one witness may need to be aligned with tokens in a different order in another witness, while nonetheless retaining each witness’s token order.</p>
<p>Finally, the algorithms most commonly used to implement alignment routines, such as Needleman-Wunsch <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> or the Dekker <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> algorithm in CollateX, reduce the computational complexity of the alignment process only at a cost to the philological integrity of the output:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These two algorithms follow the principle of progressive alignment, which means that they do not compare all witnesses at the same time. Instead, they first compare two witnesses, store the result of that comparison in a so-called variant graph and then progressively compare another witness against that graph, at every turn merging the result of that comparison into the graph until all witnesses are merged. This progressive alignment method reflects the idea of dynamic programming, which takes a complicated problem and breaks it down in smaller sub-problems. In this case, the complicated task of multi-witness alignment is broken down into a repetition of the relatively easier task of two-witness alignment. A downside of progressive alignment is that, apparently, the order in which the witnesses are compared influences the final result. That is, the final alignment of three witnesses A, B, and C may differ if Witness C is compared against the variant graph of Witness A and B, or if Witness B is compared against the variant graph of Witness A and C.<br>
<sup id="fnref2:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The preceding means that progressive alignment cannot be considered an optimal strategy for multiple witness collation, since the philologically optimal alignment of the witnesses obviously cannot logically depend on the order in which the philologist (or algorithm) looks at them <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  At the same time, the computational complexity of comparing all witnesses to all other witnesses simultaneously means that optimal order-independent multiple-witness alignment is currently an unsolved problem in computer science,<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  and progressive alignment algorithms, despite their limitations, represent the current state of the art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alignment algorithms typically test only for exact matches between tokens, because looking for the closest but inexact match is prohibitively expensive computationally. For that reason, the CollateX implementation of near matching, which we describe below, is performed in the  <strong>Analysis</strong>  stage and then recycled into another instance of  <strong>Alignment</strong> . What is important in this discussion of Stage 3 is that, to the extent that near matching can be said to entail a type of normalization, it happens not in Stage 2, but, rather, in Stage 4, after an initial alignment has already been constructed.</p>
<h2 id="stage-4-analysis-and-interpretation-n">Stage 4. Analysis and interpretation (n)</h2>
<p>The 2009 meeting that led to the elaboration of the Gothenburg method did not produce a final report or white paper, and in the absence of an authoritative definition, the type of analysis that occurs at Stage 4 has been interpreted variously as both computational postprocessing and manual, human intervention between the output of  <strong>Alignment</strong>  (Stage 3) and the input into  <strong>Visualization</strong>  (Stage 5). In situations where the alignment is sub-optimal and cannot be repaired algorithmically, human intervention becomes necessary. The cost of this intervention with respect to the workflow, though, is that it introduces changes into a generated interim artifact, rather than into the base view, that is, the transcribed witness files that serve as the initial input into the processing pipeline. Any changes introduced manually beyond the base view mean that if the collation operation must be re-run from the beginning (for example, if a new witness is added, or if editorial decisions about word division change), the manual effort is lost, and must be repeated. In other words, manual intervention creates a new, derived base view, one that can no longer be generated from the original base view entirely by the computational pipeline.</p>
<p>The purpose of the  <strong>Analysis</strong>  in Stage 4 in the Gothenburg model, whether automated or implemented manually, is described clearly in the CollateX documentation. In the case of sub-optimal output from the  <strong>Alignment</strong>  stage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[a]n additional [&hellip;] analysis of the alignment result [&hellip;] may alleviate that deficiency by introducing the possibility of a feedback cycle, in which users edit the alignment and feed their knowledge back into the alignment process for another run delivering enhanced results.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup><br>
Postprocessing performed at Stage 4, in addition to possibly improving the eventual alignment, may also be used to infer knowledge from the information added to the original texts through the first three Stages of the collation pipeline. That is, the end products of a full collation pipeline, from  <strong>Tokenization</strong>  through  <strong>Visualization</strong> , may include not only a critical edition with variation, but also, for example, summary analytic reports about the tradition, whether textual (e.g., in statistical tables) or graphic (e.g., in charts or diagrams).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this section we identify two types of computational analysis, both involving normalization, that are located at Stage 4 of the Gothenburg model. These are 1) near matching, 2) the analysis of patterns of agreement within alignment sets. Near matching is intended to improve the alignment, which is to say that the output of this Stage 4 process, after modification for near matching, is fed back into Stage 3 for realignment. The analysis of patterns of agreement is intended to enrich and customize the collation output, and is fed into Stage 5 ( <strong>Visualization</strong> ). Especially in light of the absence of clear guidance in the literature about the Gothenburg model concerning the  <strong>Analysis</strong>  stage, the two types of computational analysis discussed here should be regarded as only some of the possibilities available at this stage of the collation pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="near-matching">Near matching</h2>
<p>The term near matching, sometimes called approximate or fuzzy matching, refers to the identification of the closest match for alignment purposes, specifically in situations where there is no exact match.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  As was noted above, when CollateX compares the n properties of tokens to create an initial alignment, it looks only for exact string matches. That is, to align a token it asks not what is the closest match?, but, rather, is there an exact match? The computational complexity of checking for the closest match is sufficiently greater than the complexity of checking for an exact match that it would not be realistic to perform an entire alignment operation by computing all closest matches in all alignment positions. Furthermore, as noted earlier in the context of forced matches, as long as the alignment process finds a sufficient number of exact matches, a large number of inexact matches are likely to be forced into proper alignment anyway.</p>
<p>A situation that is susceptible to incorrect alignment involves the following two features:</p>
<p>One witness has fewer tokens than another, which means that there will be a gap in the alignment, where a token in the longer witness does not have a corresponding token in the shorter one.  There is a token in the shorter witness that is adjacent to the gap and that does not have an exact match in any of the alignment positions where it could be placed.</p>
<p>When both of the preceding conditions are met, an alignment engine that relies on exact matching is unable to decide where to position the gap, that is, whether to push a token with two or more possible inexact adjacent alignment points to the left or to the right. It is at this stage that near matching can be used to resolve the uncertainties, and because the number of comparisons for this type of limited, strategically targeted near matching is exponentially less demanding computationally than what would be required to perform near matching on all tokens during the initial alignment, it does not impose an unacceptable delay.</p>
<p>As an example, if we need to align The gray koala with The grey koala (note the different spellings of the color adjective) and we have not normalized one of the spellings to the other, the color words will nonetheless wind up aligned correctly because they represent a forced match between the perfect matches of The to the left and koala to the right. But suppose we have to align The gray koala with The fluffy grey koala, that is, suppose we have to decide whether to align gray in the first witness with fluffy or with grey in the second. Without near matching, CollateX has to guess, and its arbitrary strategy is to push the token in question to the left, which will produce an incorrect result:<br>
Problematic alignment of similar word tokens    Witness   Tokens       A  The  gray    koala      B  The  fluffy  grey  koala   <br>
The alignment a scholar would prefer is:<br>
Correct alignment of similar word tokens    Witness   Tokens       A  The    gray  koala      B  The  fluffy  grey  koala   <br>
With near matching, however, the  <strong>Analysis</strong>  stage could determine that gray is more similar, in terms of its string value, to grey than it is to fluffy, and recycle this information into a second, targeted,  <strong>Alignment</strong>  process that would position the token accordingly. This is how near matching works in CollateX.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup></p>
<p>The following example of the use of near matching in the  <strong>Analysis</strong>  stage to correct misalignments in the  <strong>Alignment</strong>  stage is from the  <em>Rus′ primary chronicle</em>  (3,5). In the table below, which presents the output of CollateX without near matching, the last token of Tro is misaligned. It is not string-equal to any token in either of the last two columns (note the fourth letter of the word, which does not match the fourth letter of the words in the last column of the other witnesses), so CollateX arbitrarily pushes it to the left, even though it is a closer match with the tokens to the right.<br>
Incorrect alignment of similar word tokens in the  <em>Rus′ primary chronicle</em>     Witness   Tokens       Lav  гаръмати  тавріани.  сируфьꙗ.    фраци.

Near matching is optional in CollateX, and without it we get the output above. If we turn on near matching, though, the last token in Tro is moved to the right because it is a closer match to tokens in the right column than to any in the left.</p>
<p>Near matching in CollateX uses the python-Levenshtein package to calculate similarity, which means that it does not have access to variation information beyond the character level, such as lexical substitution. A small Levenshtein distance can identify situations where scribes might have misread or miswritten individual letters and introduced a small, local corruption. But scribes might also intervene consciously to replace one entire word with another, and in such situations, the Levenshtein distance between the words is not necessarily a useful measure of  <em>editorial</em>  distance, that therefore also not necessarily a useful predictor of the optimal alignment. In such cases, a comparison metric that did not rely solely on Levenshtein character edit distance, and that also had access to other properties, might achieve a philologically preferable alignment.</p>
<h2 id="patterns-of-agreement">Patterns of agreement</h2>
<p>Normalization is ultimately a decision about when objectively different written forms should be deemed equivalent  <em>for a specific purpose</em> . At the  <strong>Alignment</strong>  stage (whether initially or with recycled input after near matching, as described above), that specific purpose is to determine which tokens should be considered part of the same variant set, whatever the category of variation. For subsequent philological research, however, it is common to distinguish between formal and substantive (sometimes called insignificant and significant) variants, where only the latter are traditionally regarded as useful for stemmatic purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>philological judgement is deployed to distinguish significant from insignificant textual variation — that is, to select those variants that are more or less likely to betray information about the exemplar from which a given text was copied.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup><br>
<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As described above,  <strong>Normalization</strong>  for  <strong>Alignment</strong>  purposes (Stage 2, feeding into Stage 3) in CollateX, by default, writes a shadow value to be used during alignment into an n property on the token. A user-designed replacement for the default normalization routine built into Stage 2 could customize the modifications employed to create the n property, and could also add other properties to the tokens — for example, in addition to orthographic normalization in the n property, it might identify the lemma, the part of speech, and the morphology, and write those into l, p, and m properties. The built-in  <strong>Alignment</strong>  stage of CollateX ignores these other properties, but it passes them along the pipeline, which means that they are accessible at later stages. Recalling that normalization is  “a decision about when objectively different written forms should be deemed equivalent  <em>for a specific purpose</em> ,”  we might perform a different type of normalization (indeed, a form of interpretation) during  <strong>Analysis</strong>  in Stage 4, comparing tokens that have already been aligned with one another to determine whether their l, p, and m properties (or some subset of those) agree. This type of analysis would enable us to distinguish, within a variant set, which readings agree completely (all properties), which agree in traditionally significant properties but differ in insignificant ones (e.g., agree in l, p, and m, but not n), and which differ in significant properties (e.g., disagree in l, p, or m).<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup></p>
<p>In the following example, the tokens ge and je both have the same (hypothetical) substantive properties: l (lemma) = je, p (part of speech) = personal pronoun, and m (morphology) = first person singular. But because the original reading (t property) is different, we deduce that the variant is orthographic or phonological, which we consider formal, rather than substantive. Toward the end of the sentence, conois is aligned with fes. In this case, their p and m properties are equal (p = verb, m = present first person singular), but the l properties carry different values, which means that the variant is lexical.<br>
Categorized variants    Witness   Tokens       A    ge  te  conois  mielz  que  tu  ne  conois  moi      B  Artu  je  te  conois  miels  que  tu  ne  fes  moi      Variant type    form.       form.         lex.      <br>
This information could be passed along to the  <strong>Visualization</strong>  stage for different purposes. For example, the output of the  <strong>Visualization</strong>  stage might be a critical apparatus where variants are grouped according to whether they agree in substantive properties, regardless of whether their n values coincide. Independently of the way variants might be presented in a text intended for critical reading, tables or graphic representations of the pairwise agreement in different types of significant features among witnesses might let us hypothesize about textual filiation and transmission. From this perspective, the output in the  <strong>Visualization</strong>  stage might include a report about textual relationships among the witnesses, or a dendrogram representation of the result of agglomerative clustering of the witnesses, as in a phylogenetic tree. Such an analytic product is no less a visualization of textual relations than a reading view that reproduces the full text with apparatus, even though it is an abstraction of the relationships, and not an organized reproduction of the primary data. Most importantly, as long as the pipeline is completely automated, different scripts can be run or re-run in order to obtain different, but complementary visualizations.</p>
<h2 id="stage-5-visualization">Stage 5. Visualization</h2>
<p>CollateX supports several output views of the variant graph, including an alignment table (in plain text or HTML, as well as CSV and TSV), a graph (in SVG), XML (both TEI and a generic XML that is suitable for subsequent transformation with XSLT), and a JSON document. Of these built-in output views, only the JSON output renders both the n property and all custom properties assigned during earlier processing, which means that users can post-process the JSON output in order to create custom visualizations. Some other built-in output formats are also able to render more than one property value for a token. For example, two types of SVG output are supported, one with just the n property value and the other with the n value and, for each node in the variant graph, all associated t values and the identifiers of the witnesses in which those readings are found, as in the figure below (Fig. 2). In this graphic, the n value is made of the part of speech and the lemma, and is written in bold in the top left cell for each node; the corresponding t values are listed below, together with the identifiers of the witnesses in which they can be found.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h2 id="revisiting-the-gothenburg-model-and-its-collatex-implementation">Revisiting the Gothenburg model and its CollateX implementation</h2>
<p>The Gothenburg model has advanced our understanding of the machine-assisted analysis of textual variation in both conceptual and practical ways. The modular nature of the model recognizes both the substantial independence of the five stages and, at the same time, the extent to which they interact within a processing pipeline. This modular conceptualization, in turn, has enabled modular implementation, where an application such as CollateX incorporates hooks that permit the user to modify one stage of the pipeline without having to interact with the others except by continuing to observe the input and output specifications built into the API.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with more than ten years of experience of the Gothenburg model behind us, we now also recognize aspects of the model, and of its implementations, that could benefit from further consideration. For example,  <strong>Visualization</strong>  (Stage 5) might more transparently be called Output or Rendering. The implementation of the model in CollateX is a good example of this, since the richest output format supported, JSON, is intended not for human visual consumption, but for automated post-processing. Additionally, in CollateX the modular stages might have been implemented with even greater mutual independence. For example, the output format (text table, HTML, SVG, JSON, etc.) is specified as an argument to the function that performs the  <strong>Alignment</strong> , which means that generating multiple output formats requires performing the same  <strong>Alignment</strong>  operation anew for each of them.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  The clearer understanding of the model that comes from a decade of experience with the CollateX implementation suggests directions for further development that could continue to enhance the benefits that are already visible in both the modular nature of the Gothenburg model and its implementation in the software.</p>
<h2 id="revisiting-normalization">Revisiting normalization</h2>
<p>A uniquely broad and consequential insight in this retrospective context is that  <strong>Normalization</strong>  (Stage 2) and normalization (with a lower-case n) are different, and normalization (small n) is broadly and correctly distributed over several stages of the pipeline.  <strong>Normalization</strong>  (Stage 2) means identifying string-level differences in witness tokens that should be ignored for alignment purposes, but the point of this report has been to explore the many ways in which normalization (small n) is pervasive, affecting not only Stage 2, but also Stage 0 ( <strong>Transcription</strong> ), Stage 1 ( <strong>Tokenization</strong> ), and Stage 4 ( <strong>Analysis</strong> ). The type of normalization that is applied at these different stages emerges from a variety of considerations. For example, the character-based transcription of handwritten sources in Stage 0 necessarily entails normalization because handwriting is infinitely variable, and infinite variation cannot be represented usefully in character data. And the normalization applied in Stage 4 to support near-matching in CollateX is an accommodation to the intractable computational complexity of implementing near-matching globally as part of the  <strong>Alignment</strong>  stage. In other words, despite the overall clarity, accuracy, and utility of the modularization of the Gothenburg model, both scholars and developers benefit from an awareness that normalization as part of a collation pipeline neither begins nor ends with Stage 2, and also that normalization may be used in analysis and reporting in situations that are independent of alignment.</p>
<p>Figure 3, below, reproduces Figure 1, the earlier plot of the five stages of the Gothenburg model of textual collation, with the addition of an explicit Transcription (or digitization) stage between the Input (the documentary artifact) and  <strong>Tokenization</strong> , which serves as Stage 1 of the original model. Additionally, in this revised figure  <em>all</em>  of the stages that involve normalization are highlighted in green:</p>

<p>This figure represents a pipeline, corresponding to an editorial workflow. Despite our identification in this report of a broad distribution of normalization operations beyond the titular  <strong>Normalization</strong>  Stage, the modular pipeline architecture, including that stage, remains fundamental both as a way of modeling the collation process and as a guide for implementation. Indeed, the existence of an official  <strong>Normalization</strong>  Stage between  <strong>Tokenization</strong>  and  <strong>Alignment</strong> , where differences among witness tokens are neutralized in order to enable their comparison for alignment purposes, provides a context for recognizing and understanding the aspects of normalization that necessarily take place elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an additional analytical step in which the alignment results are augmented (and optionally fed back as preconditions into the collator) appears essential to us in order to bridge the methodological impedance between a plain computational approach and the established hermeneutical best-practice approach to the problem.</p>

<p>Tokenization and normalization are well-known operations in computational and corpus linguistics, and their use in CollateX is similar to the analogous linguistic operations. Cf. tokenization in computer science, sometimes called lexing or lexical analysis, which shares with linguistic tokenization the goal of dividing a continuous stream of characters into meaningful substrings for subsequent processing. In computer science, the subsequent processing is typically parsing, that is, interpreting the tokens as expressions according to the syntax of a programming language.&#160;<a href="#fnref:18" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The default implementation of Tokenization in the Python version of CollateX is performed by the  <code>tokenize()</code>  method of the WordPunctuationTokenizer class inside  <code>core_classes.py: re.findall(r'\w+\s*|\W+', contents)</code> . This defines a token as 1) either a sequence of word characters followed optionally by a sequence of whitespace characters, or 2) a sequence of non-word characters, which is typically punctuation, also followed optionally by a sequence of whitespace characters. This means that a token may consist entirely of whitespace only when it falls at the beginning of a text (where it will match  <code>\W+</code> ), since any whitespace not at the beginning of the text will form the trailing part of the token that begins with whatever word or punctuation characters precede it.&#160;<a href="#fnref:20" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Normalization in support of alignment in this edition also implements case folding, neutralizes several other character distinctions (including ѧ vs я in this word), and ignores line breaks (represented by a vertical bar), punctuation, and superscription. The examples in this article simplify the actual CollateX output by representing characters tagged with  <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>  tags as superscript characters and removing the  <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>  tags and all others (principally  <code>&lt;lb&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;pb&gt;</code> ). This markup is removed from the n properties when they are created during Stage 2  <strong>Normalization</strong> , and therefore is not involved in Alignment decisions.&#160;<a href="#fnref:27" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><strong>Alignment</strong>  in CollateX by default distinguishes only exact matches and non-matches, and it has no understanding of near matching, that is, of finding the closest inexact match.

<p>The researcher may also attach other properties, in addition to t and n, to tokens, and these can be returned as part of the output. Properties other than n are not used by the default alignment engine inside CollateX, but, in keeping with the modularity of the Gothenburg model, a researcher could replace the default CollateX alignment routine with an alternative that performs a more complex evaluation. For example, it is theoretically possible to perform several types of normalization, assign their results to different token properties, and perform the alignment in a way that assigns different weights to different degrees of matching in different token properties.&#160;<a href="#fnref:32" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>In situations where researchers are able to hypothesize about the relationships among the witnesses before performing machine-assisted collation, they can exploit order dependencies of the algorithms by comparing the two witnesses that are assumed to be most closely related first. This approach will fail, though, in situations where different witnesses may be closest in different portions in the work. Additionally, and more generally, confidence about which witnesses are most closely related is proportional to the extent to which the collation has already been completed, a circular workflow that effectively amounts to requiring collation as a precursor to deciding how to implement the collation. CollateX has limited control over the order in which witnesses are incorporated into a collation. It can add witnesses one by one in an order specified by the researcher, but it cannot compare, for example, witnesses A and B and, separately, C and D, and then merge the two (A+B, C+D) interim variant graphs. That is, after comparing the first two witnesses and producing an initial variant graph, CollateX always aligns exactly one new witness at a time against the variant graph, and it cannot align a new witness directly against another new witness or an interim variant graph directly against another interim variant graph.&#160;<a href="#fnref:39" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>CollateX performs near matching not by revising the alignment table directly, but by adjusting the rank of the token in the variant graph, which, among other things, informs the layout of the alignment table. This makes the adjusted alignment information available at a lower level, and therefore also in output structures that do not use the alignment table, such as graph or SVG output.&#160;<a href="#fnref:43" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Another way to regard this issue emerges from the diasystemic nature of manuscript evidence, where (to simplify) features of the text are transmitted through the filter of features of the manuscript (that is, scribal practice) <sup id="fnref1:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. During this transmission, the features traditionally considered significant (e.g., lexical) are those that are not affected subconsciously by scribal practice or habit as easily as those traditionally considered insignificant (e.g., orthography, although this, too, is a simplification). From this perspective, insofar as scribal norms or habits may be independent of the content of the text being copied, focusing on significant variation may be considered a strategy for prioritizing features of the text over those of the manuscript. Andrews 2016 challenges the traditional division of features into significant and insignificant, finding that, in the artificial traditions she examined,  “human judgement was not significantly better than random selection for choosing the variant readings that fit the stemma in a text-genealogical pattern.”   <sup id="fnref1:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>&#160;<a href="#fnref:44" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Clicking repeatedly on the refresh button on the <a href="https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/">whatisdigitalhumanities.com</a> web page reveals a new definition for digital humanities (DH)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  each time. Many of the definitions given by the over 800 participants in the  <em>Day of DH</em> , from 2009 to 2014, state that DH has something to do with applying computational methods in humanities research and teaching <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. In the same way, the literature that ponders the character of DH points out that the core of DH lies in combining these two approaches <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. While there are almost as many ways of verbalizing the definition of DH as there are individuals involved in it, it seems that many of us agree that DH operates in the intersection of what has traditionally been considered to be humanities disciplines and computing.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is valid to state that DH is a field that is rooted in interdisciplinarity. The dynamics, challenges, and promises of DH all emerge from the interaction of diverging disciplines and approaches. The interdisciplinary character of DH emphasizes the social aspects of research, where intellectual communication becomes an integral part of a research process. The centers and laboratories that have been established in various universities have become important nodes in the global  “web of DH,”  owing to their ability to bring people together. These spaces are focal points in the interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge, as they connect humanities, social sciences, computer sciences, mathematics, and knowledge in other fields to produce new understanding, host a multitude of projects, and bring different departments and organizations together as part of a wider DH network. One could say that DH centers are the hubs of DH, which both support and gain their energy from the constant transfer of knowledge among various actors.</p>
<p>If transfer of knowledge is crucial both for DH centers and the field, how do DH centers manage and facilitate the interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge? How is transfer of knowledge promoted so that individual scholars gain an understanding what is being done in the other disciplines, and collaboration of interdisciplinary research groups has less obstacles? The practices, facilitation, and organization of DH projects and communities have been gaining increasing scholarly interest over the past years. The themes that encompass the tasks and institutional models of DH centers <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, the best ways to manage DH projects <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, the steps needed for establishing a DH community <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, or collaboration and communication <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, have been topical in the ongoing discussion. Simultaneously, interdisciplinary research and knowledge transfer within organizations has been widely examined in management studies, thereby enabling categorizations of the features of knowledge transfers <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. These studies have provided important information on the features of DH research and indicated factors that are generally considered crucial in information transfers. However, thus far, it is not very clear how the DH field facilitates interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and what this reveals about the field in general.</p>
<p>Understanding the practices, structures, and the community underlying knowledge construction — which knowledge transfer is a crucial part of — is important for grasping what DH research is based on and its various nuances. Knowledge is inseparable from the communities that create it, its context, structure, and the means with which it is produced and shared. It is an ongoing social accomplishment, constituted and re-constituted in practice <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Thus, the manner in which DH communities function and in which their knowledge transfer activities are facilitated influences the knowledge they produce.</p>
<p>This article studies how DH professionals describe the interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge that takes place in DH centers and what they see as the main ways of facilitating these transfers. Responding to this research question contributes to the discussions on the premises on which DH research produces knowledge by exploring the field from the perspective of transfer of knowledge. The underlying idea is that understanding how knowledge is transferred within the field enables us to analyze what kind of knowledge DH research produces and identify the potential limitations for our knowledge base. The ways we make DH possible influences the ways we conduct research and, finally, the outcomes of our research.</p>
<p>The current study is based on eight interviews with DH facilitators in (alphabetical order): Comhis Collective (Helsinki, Finland); HELDIG (Helsinki, Finland); Northeastern University Library Digital Scholarship Group (from now on NULDSG, Boston Mass., USA); NULab (Northeastern University, Boston Mass., USA); and University College London Digital Humanities Center (from now on UCLDH, London, UK).<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  The interviewees worked in different positions in DH centers — they were directors, leading scholars, managers, and administrators — and thus the expertise of the interviewees comes with different perspectives toward facilitating DH research. The idea of the interviews was to collect the experiences of DH facilitators and practitioners and analyze how they describe the organizational, infrastructure and practice based obstacles for DH research, and their solutions to overcome them. The overarching question of the semi-structured interviews was  “how does your center/group facilitate DH research?”  excavated by detailed questions on the everyday practices of the institution. The used analysis method was thematic analysis with inductive essentialist approach <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Following this approach, the article identifies platforms of and recurrent practices and obstacles related to transfer of knowledge in the interviews. The small sample of interviews, even if collected in three countries, does not represent all the DH centers or even all the aspects of the studied centers. However, being experienced and well-networked DH professionals working in thriving DH centers, the interviewees’ visions related to the field furthers the discussion on how the ways DH is facilitated affects the outcomes of the field.</p>

<p>I think that one of the most interesting results [of the NULab] are some of the unexpected results of the crossed collaboration that has come out of it.[Interview with Ryan Cordell]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When describing the activities at the NULab Ryan Cordell drew a picture of interdisciplinary collaboration, where  “people from computer sciences work together with the people from English, people in political science and journalism work together, folks from African-American studies collaborate with computer scientists, [all] working together on memes”  [Interview with Ryan Cordell]. In fact all the interviewees considered interdisciplinarity to be rooted in the core idea of DH research, and the main factor that made DH research fascinating. Consequently, they described the work in DH centers resulting from the activities of people belonging to different disciplines, departments, and organizations [Interview with Élika Orgtega] [Interview with Sarah Connell] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen] [Interview with Caroline Klibanoff] [Interview with Mikko Tolonen] [Interview with Melissa Terras] [Interview with David Beavan].</p>
<p>DH centers, as understood in this article, are  <em>spaces</em>  manifested through a variety networks, collaborations, organizational structures, digital presence and occasionally, but not always, in physical premises <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Although the studied centers reside at academic institutions, their physical  “location”  can be fluid and non-bounded. Simultaneously, interdisciplinary research can be defined as a mode of research that transgresses the traditional boundaries of disciplines and is more extensive or powerful than the sum of the components <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Research literature identifies various forms of interdisciplinary research, and the typology of interdisciplinary collaboration continues to be debated. For example, scholars classify interdisciplinary research into  <em>multidisciplinary</em> ,  <em>transdisciplinary</em> , and  <em>interdisciplinary</em>  research depending on the level and process of integration of the participating disciplines <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Regardless the intensity of interdisciplinary integration, it seems that the first step required for interdisciplinary collaboration leading to fruitful mixes of disciplinary approaches, is the transfer of knowledge from one discipline to another.</p>
<p>The concept of  “transfer of knowledge”  in its basic form implies  “conveyance of knowledge from one place, person or ownership to another.”  Transfer of knowledge does not imply transfer of an entire replica of the knowledge to the receiver, as the knowledge can be modified in the receiving unit <sup id="fnref2:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Transfer of knowledge is a loose concept that has been studied in various kinds of research that analyze activities between countries and organizations, including within and outside academia <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Because of its fluidity, transfer of knowledge can also be used as an analytical tool in studying the facilitation of interdisciplinary collaboration, such as DH research.</p>
<p>When discussing everyday interdisciplinary practices, the interviewees referred to versatile activities of interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge, varying from listening to talks held by scholars from other disciplines to integrated collaboration and joint production of research findings. The reasons for organizing all these activities lays in the ways we understand where interdisciplinary research can lead us. The research literature reveals both cynical and optimistic reasons for interdisciplinary researcher interaction. Interdisciplinary research has been a fashionable buzzword in science and innovation policy, where it has been assumed that increased collaboration leads to increased productivity of scientific achievements and innovations. This has led to expanded usage of the term in the funding applications, but not always in research practice <sup id="fnref3:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. In addition to using interdisciplinary research as a label for being competitive in grant calls, there is also genuine belief that only by going beyond the boundaries of disciplines will we be able to understand and respond to the complex problems of the world <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Furthermore, interdisciplinary researcher interaction can profoundly change the premises of research <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. According to the interviewees, the main point of interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge was the potential of reaching unexpected outcomes. For them, at its best, interdisciplinary collaboration leads to new findings and forming new understanding. The experiences of the interviewees demonstrated that the results of an interdisciplinary collaboration can be more than the sum of the contributors and lead to outcomes that no one could expect [Interview with Mikko Tolonen] [Interview with Ryan Cordell]. Interdisciplinary collaboration is the salt and pepper — and most likely also the chili and honey — of DH research, that promises reaching for the epoch-making findings.</p>
<p>While there are high expectations for interdisciplinary collaboration, implementing it in practice is not easy. The interviewees noted that the main challenges of such a collaboration are related to divergent ways of understanding issues, varying from the basic assumption of the preferred outcomes of research and concepts, to more concrete questions of what makes a paper, or how to name authors, and to different institutional and individual expectations [Interview with Sarah Connell] [Interview with Melissa Terras] [Interview with Ryan Cordell]. The challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration have been discussed widely in different fields <sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>] <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, including DH literature. The latest studies in DH have identified misconceptions and distrust among different disciplines and schools, as well as structural and promotion-related obstacles to collaborative research <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Obstacles often arise when differing disciplinary cultures with distinctive practices need to achieve something together. At its worst, attempted collaboration among various disciplinary cultures can lead to collisions due to epistemological and methodological differences, discipline-driven understanding of the context, and uneven technical skills <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref4:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. In addition to the social challenges for interdisciplinary understanding, the literature has identified several obstacles for information flows in DH research, which result from combinations of siloed organizational structures and administration, using processes of digital tools that create bottlenecks in information flows, lack of collaboration, differences in understanding among different disciplines, unclear knowledge-sharing practices, and lack of continuity and maintenance <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This brings us to the question that if transfer of knowledge is simultaneously challenging and crucial for DH, how can we enable and support fruitful interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge? In her interview, Élika Ortega offered a path for finding a solution to the challenge of understanding gap between disciplines. She compared the interdisciplinary research of DH to a wide spectrum of perspectives, where scholars coming from different disciplines reside — literature scholars sit next to anthropologists, while mathematicians are located closer to computer scientists in the spectrum. According to Ortega, it can be difficult to understand someone at the other end of that spectrum, while scholars in neighboring disciplines are easier to understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think there are [problems in interdisciplinary understanding]. [ — ] If we stretched out that spectrum, I guess some of us [the DHers] would end up in one extreme, and some other would end up in the other end, [ — ] but there are all of the steps in between. So, if this end and that end are not necessarily communicating right away, then there are steps to follow to one or the other, or to the middle point where that can be sort of translated. And they translate little by little, like move knowledge from one to the other. To move it through the spectrum. So, I think it definitely happens, and the bigger the group the more that happens.[Interview with Élika Ortega]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Ortega, interdisciplinary research in DH is about a step-by-step transfer of understanding along the spectrum, transmission of knowledge from one discipline to the neighboring one, and onward from that. An analysis of the interviews of this study reveals that implementing gradual transfer of knowledge requires people with differing knowledge (actors), networks, and spaces facilitating communication as well as motivation and supporting practices. The following sub-sections of this article will discuss how these features support interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge in DH centers.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-and-maintenance-of-networks">The Creation and Maintenance of Networks</h2>
<p>The core of the interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge in DH centers are networks. When asked about the main activities of the DH centers, the interviewees described various methods of creating and maintaining interdisciplinary networks to support informal communication and structured transfer of knowledge. The first and most crucial step in enabling interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge is to enable people from different disciplines to meet and communicate with each other. All the interviewees indicate that building and maintaining the network and ensuring that people meet each other on a regular basis to share their thoughts and ideas are the core of facilitating DH research. The DH centers enable this meeting of people by organizing weekly meetings, seminars, talks, tutorials, workshops, office hours,  “speed-dating,”  speaker series, hackathons, summits compiling all local DH projects, and meetings of smaller groups and other less and more formal meetings that bring people together. [Interview with David Beavan] [Interview with Ryan Cordell] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen] [Interview with Melissa Terras] [Interview with Sarah Connell] [Interview with Mikko Tolonen] [Interview with Caroline Klibanoff]. When meeting each other, the representatives of different disciplines discuss and share ideas that often foster new thoughts <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. The networking activities of DH centers are not necessarily different from other academic environments, but because people come to DH from different disciplines, enhanced attention must be given to getting people together, thereby making building and maintaining networks more essential.</p>
<p>The interviewed DH specialists indicated that they used various paths for networking and sharing experiences and information in the community. Moreover, they also added that numerous facilitators had carefully shaped the different forms of the meetings to enable the highest level of transfer of knowledge. Thus, one can say that they do not merely gather people together in the same room and hope for the best but that they have created several routines or practices that support the sharing of information. For example, at Northeastern’s NULab and Digital Scholarship Group, administrators organize various meetings so that there are moments where everybody talks and not only the invited speakers [Interview with Sarah Connell].</p>
<p>The transfer of explicit knowledge in DH centers takes place in courses and workshops. A few centers offer consultation sessions on various themes, as well as help students and scholars to launch projects that contain methods that are new for them [Interview with Caroline Klibanoff]. Although formal education is usually directed at students, there is also a need to learn new things among scholars who have completed their formal education. Director of HELDIG, Eero Hyvönen, indicated that they organize DH courses not only for students but also scholars with the hope that the latter would update their knowledge and add new elements to their knowledge base [Interview with Eero Hyvönen].</p>
<p>Interestingly, numerous interviewees emphasized the importance of informal meetings, although the centers also organize more formal event [Interview with Ryan Cordell] [Interview with Melissa Terras] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen]. For example, Ryan Cordell mentioned how he had learned new methods from informal conversations with colleagues in other disciplines [Interview with Ryan Cordell]. Thus, it appears that informal events ease the processes of becoming acquainted with others and building trust as they allow free-flowing discussion in a less hierarchical atmosphere, which contribute to the transfer of tacit knowledge. Informal meetings may lead to something that the interviewees described as  “unexpected results of crossed collaboration”  [Interview with Ryan Cordell] [see also Interview with Mikko Tolonen]. Along the same lines, Phillips et al. describe in this special issue the  “serendipitous accidents”  as one of the key engines of their lab <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. It appears that open and unplanned interdisciplinary encounters foster unexpected results, which include the promise and potential of interdisciplinary research.</p>
<p>Further, the interviewees described how sharing information at various levels translates into different kinds of activities in their work, such as learning new methods, establishing new projects, teaching, etc. According to them, the outcomes of the transfer of knowledge can assume many forms. A discussion with a colleague can translate into a new angle in a research project, teaching, or form the basis of a new invention. Things learned in a workshop can be transformed into a grant proposal, applied to research, or implemented in teaching [Interview with Ryan Cordell] [Interview with Sarah Connell].</p>
<p>The active networking — or  “colliding”  ( “törmäyttäminen”  in Finnish) of people, as formulated by Eero Hyvönen — is not an accidental activity. In fact, it is in the very core of creating a thriving DH center. The goal of constant networking and communication across disciplines is the establishment of interdisciplinary research groups, which will be helpful when applying for funding. For Melissa Terras,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[p]art of the thing is that it&rsquo;s good for people to meet regularly, because if you have a chance to meet people in the seminars then when the grant call comes in, then you will find more easily people to work with grant applications, you can put people together with other people, you can network when you know a lot of people, when you know a lot of people you will be able to put together them when needed. So, the Center is set up to be a mailman that helps people to get to know each other.[Interview with Melissa Terras]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the interviewees, extensive and lively networks, promoted by active linking of people, are an important aspect of  “social security” . Furthermore, they are also crucial for the center’s survival in the academic world, where a great part of funding is competitive project-based external funding. Therefore, the DH centers, for example NULab, have created paths that support the establishment of successful research groups from serendipitous interdisciplinary encounters in DH meetings and networking by providing small  “seed grants,”  which, hopefully, lead to receiving external research grants [Interview with Sarah Connell].</p>
<p>Throughout the interviews, it became evident that the studied DH centers function as umbrellas for loose, rather informal and dynamic networks of scholars, students, librarians, museum experts, activists, and university administrators. When asked about the number of people involved in the activities of the centers, the interviewees found it difficult to define exact numbers, because there is a different number of participants in various events and the form and strength of involvement of the people varies. Many of the interviewees identified layers of involvement of people in the various activities of the DH center. They indicated that some people are strongly involved in a research group, while others may be more actively participating, for example, in a speaker series [Interview with Sarah Connell] [Interview with Caroline Klibanoff] [Interview with Ryan Cordell] [Interview with David Beavan]. In addition, partner organizations — such as libraries, museums, and archives — can be integrally involved in research projects, teaching, or participating in the open events [Interview with Melissa Terras] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen]. Thus, thriving DH communities tend to be larger than merely the  “official”  employed members of the DH center, as they involve people with different layers of memberships and networks. Out of these, the interconnections that can be called  “micro”  and  “macro”  networks are crucial for DH centers.</p>
<h2 id="interdisciplinary-transfer-of-knowledge-in-micro--and-macro-networks">Interdisciplinary Transfer of Knowledge in Micro- and Macro-networks</h2>
<p>The functions and purposes of transfer of knowledge vary in the different layers of the DH networks. For an individual DH scholar, networks make learning what is being done in other disciplines more reachable: if you know people from different disciplines, it is easier to ask questions on new methods or unfamiliar approaches when you encounter them. Simultaneously at the  “micro”  (the collaborative research groups) and the  “macro”  (the wider cross-institutional) layers of the DH center the networks have different functions.</p>
<p>The actual face-to-face everyday interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge in DH centers takes place in the core units of research and working groups. Collaboration on a particular theme facilitates the efficient transfer of knowledge among participants. For example, Élika Ortega identified interdisciplinary working groups focusing on concrete common themes as a good way to start interdisciplinary collaboration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think we have discussed [challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration] that much, but we are looking into creating working groups based on salient things that we could identify. Some people were talking that we could start a working group on images, where people working with archival images, or memes, or photography, let say. Then there was this idea to establish a social media working group. So that’s the way that we try to bring our heads together despite our… I don’t want to say differences, but … various profiles. [Interview with Élika Ortega]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The micro networks of collaborative research groups, which enable recurring meeting and discussion with representatives of other disciplines interested in the same topic form the Communities of Practice (CoP). CoPs are informal groups of people bound together by a common purpose and are considered particularly good for facilitating transfer of tacit knowledge and informal circulation of information <sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref3:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. People who participate in micro-networks learn, in concrete terms, the approaches and understandings of scholars in other disciplines, which is difficult to transfer through other means.</p>
<p>The interviewees indicated various ways to prevent challenges in transfer of knowledge in the micro-networks. As discussed earlier, the challenges of interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge may include misconceptions, lack of understanding, trust, or even respect arising from the differences in disciplinary cultures. In addition, work in interdisciplinary research teams comes with an integrated form of collaboration that can be new, particularly in terms of humanists who are often trained to work alone [Interview with Mikko Tolonen] <sup id="fnref2:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. In order to overcome the challenges of interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge in research teams, the involved scholars must understand and respect the diverging approaches of their collaborators [Interview with Melissa Terras]. Thus, behind the façades of sophisticated methods and shiny visualizations, the very core of a successful DH team is based on the basic human needs of being recognized and respected, besides the desire to expand scholarly knowledge. Furthermore, for facilitating collaboration, the research teams need to have explicit discussions on the joint goals of the project as well as the different ways of crediting in different disciplines in order to ensure that everybody leaves the project with the requisite  “credits”  [Interview with Ryan Cordell].</p>
<p>Other scholars have also indicated that agreeing upon the modes of communication, milestones, expected roles and obligations, means of conduct, and modes of publication at the very beginning of a project can foster open communication and prevent misunderstandings. Teams must devote time for the participants to build trust and get to know each other so that they may work together efficiently. For a DH project to be successful, there must be an emphasis on maintaining communication, good human management, and sufficient face-to-face time <sup id="fnref3:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge in micro-networks, communication across organizational boundaries is crucial for DH centers. Building and maintaining networks beyond institutional boundaries, and even outside the universities or academic circles, was considered important by the directors and managers of established DH centers. Apart from university faculty, a well-working DH network also includes specialists from libraries, archives, museums, public and non-governmental organizations, and businesses [Interview with Melissa Terras] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen] [Interview with Sarah Connell].</p>
<p>In order to attract people from other organizations and expand the borders of the DH community, the events are usually open to anyone who is interested in walking in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of our events are public, we have a lot of researchers from other institutions. Occasionally we get real people from the public, which is lovely when that happens, or sometimes professionals working in industry, and things like that.[Interview with David Beavan]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DH centers organize formal organizational meetings and industry advisory panels, to which they invite representatives of different organizations; in addition, they maintain the information flow through informal meetings. Melissa Terras describes the breathtakingly wide networks that require active maintaining, but are indispensable for the UCLDH:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&ndash;] we have an industry advisory panel twice a year, so we have meetings with the British Library, British Museum, National Gallery and range of other people… London Metropolitan Archives and the industry hearing panels, so we have a whole network. In addition to that I spend a lot of time, two or three hours a week, just meeting people and hearing what&rsquo;s going on. There are a lot of people from different institutions that I go out for coffee we just get together and chat about stuff about what&rsquo;s happening so that I can keep together these networks and if something happens. Often grant applications [come at] a very short term and you need to make a project very quickly and you need to know who am I going to call and ask to participate in the project. Networking is very important. I think it takes a certain type of person to do that and it takes a certain type of a drive to do that. It´s important to know what is going on in different places.[Interview with Melissa Terras]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As discussed earlier, interorganizational networking is crucial for enabling information flow among people and for a prompt launching of cross-organizational project applications. Moreover, keeping oneself updated on the developments outside the university provides an important understanding of the directions of evolution in the realm of digitality in a wider context.</p>
<p>The physical context of the DH center — the city and the country in which it is located — influences how the center regards external collaboration. The existence of potential collaborative and rival organizations in close proximity provide opportunities for collaboration and a background for comparison and competition [Interview with Élika Ortega] [Interview with Sarah Connell] [Interview with Melissa Terras] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen].</p>
<p>Interestingly, the interviews reveal how location in a prominent city with several major universities (such as Boston or London) and in smaller cities with fewer local universities (like Helsinki) make the DH centers mindful about their position. In major cities, the scale of comparison can be within the city, while in smaller locations, the broader international context becomes significant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess another thing that has helped us here in this particular context is… I mean Boston is a really weird city to do anything academic, because there are, I guess 50 universities in the city. There are the heavy weights, like the MIT and Harvard, who, I mean any normal person is thinking that whatever I might be doing they are doing it better! [laughs] Because it´s MIT and Harvard, right! That is interesting, and obviously they are awesome in everything that they do, they have such long and important institutional histories that they follow that they might not be adopting newer trends as DH as readily. So that is where I think Northeaster, our dean, and the NULab has made a big dent. In the absence of having a big DH center in Harvard or MIT, and there are people doing it, and doing it really well, although not as widespread as we do it here. So we have had this opportunity to be competitive by doing this thing here, and we have got the institutional support. I think that’s a higher level thinking about the strategies.[Interview with Élika Ortega]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything in Finland is so small that everybody understands that we need to do things together, if we need to accomplish something bigger. This is why we have been able to do bigger projects in Finland. [ — ] This does not happen often abroad. One reason for that can be that there are so strong players who can manage by themselves also. [ — ] This is why we have created our agenda around the idea of a network so that we will collaborate with all major institutions, and not so that the collaboration would happen only within the university. [Interview with Eero Hyvönen]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the interview with the Finnish DH center, the collaboration instruments at the level of the European Union — such as CLARIN and DARIAH — were mentioned as important channels of collaboration [Interview with Eero Hyvönen]. In the interviews with the US and UK DH centers, international collaboration was not explicitly mentioned, although both institutions accommodate several international projects. It appears that for centers in smaller countries, comparable foreign organizations provide meaningful reference points.</p>
<p>Further, the means through which DH centers facilitate the transfer of knowledge in micro- and macro-networks are similar —  “colliding”  people on a regular basis! However, the purposes of these networks are different. While practical work on a joint theme enables transfer of tacit knowledge, the general inter-organizational meetings also provide — in addition to potential strength in funding applications — an important context for the center. Although the networks are different, they are both crucial for the centers and they support each other.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-structure--the-glue-that-holds-together">Organizational Structure – the Glue that Holds Together</h2>
<p>Although the divergent, loose, and dynamic networks of interested individuals are the core of DH centers, the organizational structures of the centers also have an important role in facilitating knowledge transfers. The organizational structures provide sustainability and continuity to the dynamic and ever-changing networks. The employment status of the members of DH centers varies and in addition to the tenure positions, a great number of people work part-time or have short-term contracts. This creates instability and may lead to situations where tacit knowledge, lessons learned, best practices, and even knowledge on the methods or deeper understanding of certain data are lost with dynamic changes <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. A concrete illustration of this is that at least three of the eight interviewees have changed their positions by the publication of this article. In DH, accumulated knowledge is not stored only in publications but also in the logics of the methods and the datasets employed. Although a lack of continuity and maintenance of knowledge might not be crucial problems for an individual research project, it can create knowledge gaps in the field in the longer run. Creating continuity by supporting documentation, accumulation, and storage of knowledge in one way or another is an increasingly important task of DH centers.</p>
<p>The interviews did not address continuity directly, but they revealed many ways in which the functions of the staff of DH centers support this. In addition to the support for networking, the interviewees listed providing know-how through networks, the ability to hint what needs to be addressed with specific questions, sharing practical advice on how to begin and run a DH project, and providing support in writing grants as crucial tasks. In many DH centers, the coordinator works as a crucial node for maintaining and supporting, keeping everything on track, and ensuring that communication works [Interview with Sarah Connell] [Interview with David Beavan]. In addition, to the fact that they  “make the information flow,”  they also seem to function as crucial institutional memory of the organizations. As Sarah Connell describes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[w]e are especially useful for being someone you can contact with an idea and say “I want to do this and I don’t know how, I don’t even know who else is doing this, I even don’t know if this has been done four hundred times” and we’ll either know — because between the three of us Elizabeth, David and me — we have a fairly diverse expertise, or we’ll know who to ask. So, we are a good place for people who can’t see their next step in digital research. [Interview with Sarah Connell]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The DH centers develop new resources for research and maintain a knowledge base by listing available tools and informally sharing information and the best practices of the uses of them. For example, the Comhis Collective (and other research groups affiliated with HELDIG) produce new data sets, methods, analysis pipelines, and tools with tutorials and e-learning packages that they are sharing with others in the spirit of open science [Interview with Mikko Tolonen] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen]. The codes, manuals, and information on the developed methods, tools, data sets, and pipelines require maintenance. Since research groups are often temporary settings, there is a need for institutional and more stable settings that support external dissemination of the new knowledge and ensure more stable storage of the documentation.</p>
<p>For a DH center, resources, information on them, where they exist, and how they can be used is fundamental for creating continuity through accumulated knowledge. The resources are often scattered around university campuses, and DH centers also pool resources with different institutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[At the Northeastern University] the infrastructure is scattered around the campus. Some of it is at the neural sciences institute or at the library [ — ] I think that is an advantage. Given all that, I don’t think that in big institutions not all the infrastructure is going to be in one place. The idea of distributed infrastructure is very useful. If you are going to try something like that it would be useful to have an assessment of what kind of infrastructure is [already] available and where [to whom], and who can do what better, or more carefully. Because then the work can be done, and the communications can happen in synchronous email or Slack, or regular meetings monthly or so.[Interview with Élika Ortega]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the fact that the tools must exist, there is a need to spread awareness of their availability with the help of lists and meetings. DH centers require organizational structures and administration to keep dynamic networks together, maintain organizational memory, and ensure continuity. Being points that concentrate information on past projects, collected resources, and available tools, the organizational structures of DH centers facilitate and support the transfer of knowledge in the longer term.</p>
<h2 id="shared-physical-space-as-a-transmitter">Shared Physical Space as a Transmitter</h2>
<p>The interviews with DH professionals reveal that although work in DH is about handling digital data with digital tools, physical proximity is an important factor facilitating the transfer of knowledge also in the DH field [see also <sup id="fnref3:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>]. Sharing the same space is an important transmitter of understanding, and it appears to be a response to the challenges of interdisciplinary transfer of tacit knowledge. If, as suggested by the research literature, the transfer of tacit knowledge requires interaction and proximity of people <sup id="fnref4:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, how do DH centers actually provide it?</p>
<p>According to the experiences of the interviewees, proximity can be achieved in different ways. Certain DH centers have permanent spaces dedicated for joint meetings and workshops, lab spaces with special equipment, or office space for the staff, while others arrange meetings at a variety of locations with no single permanent physical space. At the time of the interviews, the Boston NULab, NULDSG, and HELDIG had, or were about to have, their own spaces for meetings and individual work. Simultaneously, UCLDH does not have its own physical premises apart from one lab space, but the members of the network meet regularly in various places. Even if DH labs would have physical spaces, often, the majority of the affiliated people do not have offices there, as they might work in their home departments or in libraries.</p>
<p>Further, numerous interviewees considered the existence of a permanent physical space as a crucial part of the center’s activities, although they described different ways of organizing physical proximity as optimal [Interview with Caroline Klibanoff] [Interview with Mikko Tolonen] [Interview with Sarah Connell] [Interview with Ryan Cordell] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen]. According to Mikko Tolonen, the possibility to surround oneself only with issues of interest in the digital world can hinder fruitful encounters of unknown ideas, which can happen easier in the analog world’s face-to-face encounters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all kinds of development informal meetings are crucial. It is not a coincident that the concentrations of know-how are often located in a small area. It makes you to exchange ideas. [ — ] When people meet each other, it may lead to something unexpected. In digital world you can demarcate exactly the kind of bubble you want to, but [physically] you are forced to meet [all kinds of] people when you are getting yourself a coffee. [ — ] It is easy to establish different kinds of centers to the Internet. You can just make a website and call it something, but it does not mean that things will actually happen there. If you have some kind of physical presence, it forces things to start happening! [Interview with Mikko Tolonen]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some interviewees emphasized the importance of joint space where people can enter easily for facilitating informal exchange of ideas, thereby increasing (interdisciplinary) communication. Being in the same room makes one actually understand what is going on in there [Interview with Caroline Klibanoff]. Certain interviewees considered informal collective work to be the preferable use of the joint DH space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The importance of people being proximate to each other, that’s something that I think should be taken quite seriously. [ — ] So, thinking about how we want things to work in the NULab, we do want this space to be one for informal collective work. Where I’m doing something on my computer and you are doing something on your computer and then lean over, talk, talk, talk, go back to your own separate thing. We will try to see if that happens organically, and if it doesn’t we are going to make it happen [ — ] by scheduling some structured work time. [ — ] I think that we are really still trying to figure out what’s the best way that we can have this space help to make the community to take shape.[Interview with Sarah Connell]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to joint collaborative working spaces, the interviewees mentioned the benefits of having (separate) offices located in close proximity to each other. When asked about the benefits of belonging to the DH center, the interviewees indicated learning from scholars in other disciplines by actively working with them. One of the factors that they believed to promote such learning was the location of office spaces in close proximity, which led to everyday conversations and experimenting with new methods. For example, being located in the same corridor encourages people to have quick conversations, which can be more effective from the viewpoint of transfer of knowledge than long but rare meetings [Interview with Ryan Cordell]. As an effect of proximity,  “things start happening.”  By establishing everyday micro contacts and sharing small things, it is easier to understand the other person:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think proximity is important if you want to actually work together. When we were separated, we got together and had our meeting, and talked that we should work on this or that, and you go your separate ways and you don´t see them again until the next meeting, and things just don´t really happen. And there is awful lot of value, I think, in being in proximity, you are by, you meet more often and start talking, and start exchanging ideas. Even just with Ben over there [in the next office] we chat a lot, get into debates, and the whole thing. I just think it´s useful, there are things that can be done virtually, and things that just can´t. [Interview with Ryan Cordell]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Eero Hyvönen, it is essential for a DH center to have physical premises; at the time of the interview, HELDIG was on the verge of acquiring a permanent space, with seminar rooms, collaborative spaces, and offices for the core staff. However, not all the staff was to have offices there, and Hyvönen stated that people in other departments could be crucial for spreading knowledge of DH research [Interview with Eero Hyvönen].</p>
<p>Although a few interviewees emphasized the importance of physical proximity, not all DH centers have set spaces or even feel that they would need such a space. Having a  “place of one’s own”  can be useful, but it is not critical if the center staff arranges alternative meeting spaces. The UCLDH is predominantly a virtual center that does not have a set space. The scholars have their individual offices in different parts of the university, where they meet with their collaborators. The center organizes a host of events, where people meet face-to-face, but they do not need a set  “DH space”  for that [Interview with Melissa Terras]. Being located in central London makes availability of physical space scarce. In addition, the interviewees felt that having no physical space makes the organization nimbler, more flexible, and interdisciplinary; this is because physical space also implies additional responsibility, and more complex financial structures. Therefore, there is no need for a physical space when a network already exists and functions [Interview with David Beavan].</p>
<p>At the level of research teams, physical proximity is not always possible. For example, although the Comhis Collective is located in Helsinki, not all its team members are present in the same premises or even in the same country. For them, Slack and other digital collaboration tools enable the flow of information among all team members. However, if there is a reliance solely on digital collaboration tools, there is a threat that the persons who are not physically present will not be aware of the latest developments. Therefore, in order to make collaboration smooth, all the team members periodically get together in the same space for days of intensive collaboration [Interview with Mikko Tolonen]. For teams working remotely, in-person meetings can be important platforms for reviewing what has been done, planning future activities, and also for resolving problematic questions that are difficult to solve through conference calls or emails <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref4:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Physical meetings are often more necessary at the beginning of a project, so that the people get used to each other. After getting to know each other by being present in the same room, it is easier for the scholars to engage in more informal communication, even online <sup id="fnref2:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref5:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="digital-transfers-of-knowledge-within-and-outside-the-community">Digital Transfers of Knowledge Within and Outside the Community</h2>
<p>In addition to physical proximity, digital communication tools are crucial for transfer of knowledge in DH centers. The different layers of networks and the level of integration of people at the DH centers are reflected in the uses of divergent communication channels, varying between openly accessible to anyone interested and closed usage of specific groups. The channels utilized — such as email lists, Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Google Drive, Trello, and others — all facilitate different kinds of communication and transfer of knowledge. Each channel has different functions and follower potential, which influences the kind of communication which they can be used for [Interview with Sarah Connell].</p>
<p>In addition to the technical features directing the usage of a digital communication tool, each channel has a distinctive culture of communication that one has to know to be able to communicate effectively. Certain channels facilitate low-barrier informal communication more easily, which includes asking  “stupid”  questions, while others contain more formal and public communication. For example, the interviewees stated that a Slack channel is a good means for low-barrier communication and asking questions, while a list-serv — used by the same community — appears more suitable for disseminating information, but nobody uses it for asking questions. Moreover, Slack’s chat-like functions serve as a low-barrier connector [Interview with Caroline Klibanoff] [see also <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>]. In Slack, you can also see all the people who are involved in the channel, while it is more difficult to identify the recipients of an email sent to a list-serv.</p>
<p>For internal sharing of information, discussions, and keeping things on track, numerous DH research projects — the micro-networks of DH centers — use internet-based communication tools like Slack, digital to-do lists like Trello, and shareable Google documents [Interview with Mikko Tolonen] [Interview with Sarah Connell] [Interview with Ryan Cordell].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there is a lot of Slack! I think most of the individual projects have their own Slack [channel]. [ — ] Different projects figure out their own communication channels, but I think a lot of them are on Slack. [Interview with Ryan Cordell]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transfer of tacit, non-verbalized knowledge requires informal communication. It is easier to share tacit knowledge when people are in the same location, but it appears that collaborating teams that already know each other can maintain sharing of tacit knowledge and emotional ties through digital communication tools as well <sup id="fnref5:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Working together and knowing each other for a longer period can give birth to a shared mini culture, where the members of the group share the internal meanings of emojis or words <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. For example, Mikko Tolonen referred to the Comhis collective’s Slack humor as an important component of collaboration [Interview with Mikko Tolonen]. Tacit knowledge is often learned in shared collaborative experiences, and learning tacit knowledge requires participation and  “doing”   <sup id="fnref6:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Moreover, transfer of tacit knowledge may be possible if the tool itself and its code of conduct are familiar to users. In DH research, explicit knowledge can be found in articles and on the Internet, but tacit knowledge is received in close connection and collaboration with colleagues.</p>
<p>In practice, digital and physical presence often overlap and, occasionally, transfer of knowledge can take place synchronously via physical proximity as well as a variety of digital channels such as Slack, Google Drive, and Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Often, even if we are physically present, we are simultaneously digitally present. Even if we are in the same room, the communication may happen in one of the chat options, Skype, or elsewhere. [Interview with Mikko Tolonen]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both digital and physical presence have different strengths and weaknesses in transfer of knowledge. Physical proximity eases the process of getting to know people and the transfer of tacit knowledge, and constant proximity makes things happen faster and collaboration more efficient. Simultaneously, digital communication tools make communication possible even over distances: a team member can participate in a weekly meeting through Skype while being located in a different country. In addition, it can also be easier to go back to earlier conversations in a chat — although not too old ones, since they may be already difficult to find in Slack for example —, and new people can join in a conversation that was initiated a month earlier.</p>
<p>The online communication within DH centers and macro-networks is vital for DH centers. The centers studied here take internet and social media communication very seriously [Interview with Melissa Terras] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen] <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are digital first, which means that we don´t really do off-line communication, we don´t do much print communication. [ — ] But we want to have a very good digital presence, which we take very seriously. We have a website, and Facebook and Twitter. [ — ] We like to be creative in our design, within the limits of the content management system we have to work with. We have a very good designer, who is part of the team, who does all the work on the website. We keep our Twitter feed up-to date, we keep our Facebook up-to date with all the activities that we are doing. I think we have around 5 000 followers on Twitter. It´s not a small thing. That means that with the digital presence, if something happens [that we want to inform people of], with all the members of the team, we can distribute a message to the potential audience of 30 000 people within a second. We take that seriously. Any digital research facility should take digital presence seriously. [Interview with Melissa Terras]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Websites and social media are important tools for spreading information to the public regarding the activities of a DH center. Thus, internet presence is crucial for maintaining the public image of a center and providing members of a community with a web identity [Interview with Eero Hyvönen] spreading information regarding what DH is and what its impact is has become crucial for establishing the field <sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Websites and social media create channels for reaching out to new people interested in DH and in potentially joining the community. In a discussion at the NULDSG weekly meeting, numerous participants — in particular the younger ones — stated that social media provided them with the first encounter with DH and the people engaging with it. Having some knowledge of a DH center and its people  “digitally”  before actually coming to the meetings was a crucial first step for them. Without this connection, it would have been too big a step to reach out and contact a DH center and its people, or move from other parts of the country to Boston to become involved in DH.</p>
<p>In addition to attracting new people, well-designed and active digital presence is also of significance for obtaining funding and to be recognized by the larger society. It is a means to determine how the funding has been used, what kinds of activities the center holds, and if granted external funding, how  “well”  it may potentially be used. Lack of an active digital presence gives an impression of an outdated or inactive center.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are aware of the fact that blog posts as a publication genre can sometimes be incredibly helpful. I’ve assigned about fifteen blog posts as I’m teaching this fall because it’s the best, clearest and shortest way to introduce an important and complicated topic. But sometimes a blog post is just the obligatory one that takes way longer to write than it should, and doesn’t end up having a lot of readership and doesn’t really benefit the person who wrote it. So we try to think whether the blog post is the best format to share a piece of information. We tend to use our blog posts partly to share research and also because we do have a lot of events, and we often get the  “I wish I could go, but…” . We Tweet the blogpost wrap ups, if you couldn’t go at all, you can at least see the links, and get the sense what the talk was about.[Interview with Sarah Connell]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, maintaining active digital presence requires effort. Several people are needed to support the distribution of knowledge from the DH center to the outside world by maintaining a website and social media channels [Interview with Sarah Connell] [Interview with Élika Ortega] [Interview with Caroline Klibanoff] [Interview with Melissa Terras] [Interview with Eero Hyvönen]. For example, the NULab travel funds require reporting on the conference or the event visited through a blog post, which adds a variety of content to the site [Interview with Ryan Cordell]. It is also preferable to share the social media post responsibility to people who are more naturally inclined toward such information, so that an active Twitter user posts on Twitter [Interview with Sarah Connell], while a constant Facebook hang-around posts on Facebook.</p>
<h2 id="boundaries-for-knowledge-transfer">Boundaries for Knowledge Transfer</h2>
<p>In addition to the multilayered knowledge transfers powered by interconnected face-to-face and online networks, communication within and outside DH centers also has restrictions. When defining and creating a space (of communication), we also set boundaries to it. The barriers to transfer of knowledge in DH centers are physical, digital, language-related, structural, social, and cultural.</p>
<p>Constructing a physical space invites certain participants but eliminates others. David Beavan indicated, when discussing the absence of physical premises of UCLDH, that while a physical space could increase communication among the core members having offices in the space, it could potentially also restrict other people’s access and cut them out [Interview with David Beavan]. Although, in principle being open to the outside world, in practice access to the spaces of the DH centers studied here is not easy for an outsider: for example, to enter the space, an individual may need an access pass to the library, a key code, or merely know how to navigate through the labyrinth of a university campus. It is very unlikely that a person would enter these DH spaces accidentally. One of the reasons for the practical restrictions is that open premises often demand that someone is present to oversee that the space, which is often equipped with the latest technology, is used for its intended purpose by the destined people.</p>
<p>Similarly, while digital communication tools facilitate interaction, they are not factually open to everyone. Certain channels, particularly those used by defined groups, allow entrance only by invitation. Communication in a small, non-public group is often easier and less formal and potentially makes exchange of ideas smoother [Interview with Caroline Klibanoff]. Thus, absolute openness of all physical premises and digital tools would eliminate the boundaries that make the DH center identifiable and water down the safer closed spaces of communication.</p>
<p>Although boundaries are necessary, it is important to discuss who and what kind of knowledge we welcome. Is there knowledge that is left out from the information flows? In recent years, the DH field has been discussing the need for a variety of approaches and the threat of  “retro-humanism”  focusing only on the canonical representation of the humanities <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. There is also strong advocacy of the use of a variety of languages, exemplified by the use of multiple languages at the DH2018 conference in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Language creates bubbles of DH communities (this article is aimed at the English language bubble) and determines hierarchies based on the competence and fluency of the speaker/writer. Participation in international (English language) communication demands special attention from the DH centers in a non-English-speaking country. In order to enable smooth international collaboration, the content on the HELDIG websites was written in English right from the outset, and the expansion of the staff by including international recruits pushed the Comhis Collective to change their operational language to English.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until recently everybody in the Collective were Finnish-speakers, but now almost all the new members come from elsewhere, and we had to change our operating language and Slack humor [into English].[laughs] [Interview with Mikko Tolonen]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Finland, where academia is practically tri-lingual — using Finnish, Swedish, and English — a change in the operating language is not a big problem. However, it sets additional linguistic requirements for individual researchers who are willing to enter the international scholarly streams of transfer of knowledge.</p>
<p>Alongside linguistic barriers, the underlying structures and logic of scholarly crediting and financing influence the ways in which research is conducted, even if, in general, the motivation of DH scholars to participate in interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge is high. The widely discussed issues of crediting for open-access publishing, opening up of the used code or data, joint publications, or potential failures of tests (that are an integral part of developing something new) are issues that can either promote or hinder interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge and the ultimate emergence of new knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore, social and cultural boundaries and the questions of who is invited to a research group, whose knowledge is valued as important, or whose work we know of are not issues that are solely related to DH; they are also related to the larger academia and societies in general <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. One can also ask to what degree are scholars associated with the more well-renowned centers more likely to have their knowledge more valued  <em>because</em>  of their association? The interviewees, being integral participants in the DH field, did not extensively discuss the issues of social and cultural boundaries. At the core, it is often difficult to see the challenges in the margins; therefore, this study cannot comprehensively cover this issue. However, a few reflections from DH professionals may contribute important perspectives to the discussion. The interviewees indicated that, to a great extent, DH is a question of self-identification and a sense of belonging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DH is at this point still a self-reported, or self-adopted title. [ — ] It is a conceptual magnet. Once you identify yourself as a digital humanist, then you start participating to the community. [Interview with Élika Ortega]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because DH is about self-identification, it would be important to create an atmosphere of openness that facilitates the inclusion of a variety of people into the field. This would ensure that the interdisciplinary processes of transfer of knowledge have sufficient variety to draw on. In other words, if knowledge is inseparable from the communities that create it, use it, and transform it <sup id="fnref7:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, we must ensure that the community is not too narrow. Further, if inclusion is the first step to accessing equality, but not a sufficient one <sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>, further studies would be required on the effects of infrastructures, practices, the general logic underlying information flow in DH, and the varied nature of the DH community.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The interdisciplinary character of DH amplifies the social aspects of its knowledge construction; therefore, it is crucial to study the means through which transfer of knowledge is facilitated in this field. This article suggests that transfer of knowledge requires people with varied knowledge, networks, physical and virtual spaces facilitating communication, motivation, and practices that support it. The interviews reveal that the studied DH centers, the focal points of the transfer of knowledge of the field, combine the elements of the transfer of knowledge in a variety of ways and, therefore, function as engines of diverse information flows. DH centers facilitate interdisciplinary and inter-organizational matchmaking and exchange of ideas by maintaining a variety of networks and institutional memory as well as by providing physical and digital spaces for exchange of explicit and tacit knowledge. Further, the interviews indicate that in order to form a dynamic unit, in addition to the top-down strategy-driven infrastructures, DH centers must nurture free-floating networks of people [see also <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>]. Maintaining respect for other perspectives and the willingness to learn and share new approaches is crucial for the field. The questions of exclusion and inclusion, who is recognized as a recognizable DH scholar, and what kind of information we value are crucial for defining the kind of scholarship and research outcomes we wish to achieve in the field in the future. The organizations running DH centers should pay attention to these features, and adjust them to the specifics of their cultural, geographical, academic and organizational environment. And, most importantly, for each individual DH practitioner it is essential to consider how our own practices affect the inclusiveness of transfer of knowledge in the DH.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; its envelopments and developments, its implications and explications, are nonetheless particular movements that must be understood in a universal Unity &hellip;<br>
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br>
While questions of visual encoding – the way visual variables, such as position, size, shape, color, or density, are used to represent data in information visualizations <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> – have always been central to visualization research and design, there has been considerable interest in the role of interactivity and animation on engagement, insight, and comprehension <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. However, when taken up in the humanities, there is arguably less attention devoted to the interactive capabilities of data visualization in contrast to the visual encoding that is employed. This may be due to the fact that there is limited guidance for designing or analyzing interactivity, especially for visualizations of complex information spaces. A lower prioritization of interactivity in visualization goes back to the, now quaint, visualization pipeline, that positions user input at the very last step <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. We argue that the main issue is the gap in the design process between devising visual encodings and integrating interactive capabilities. While this gap is often bridged through animated transitions, the resulting animations can be visually jarring <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and could serve a range of possibly competing roles <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is especially problematic when considering complex and multidimensional datasets, as of cultural collections <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> and other cases from the field of the digital humanities. Although such collections are unquestionably suitable for digital methods, an implementation, both theoretically as well as practically, of the attributed qualities into rich and coherent data visualizations often falls short. It can be challenging to arrive at interactive visual representations that are meaningful and insightful, and enable a diverse set of user tasks from explorative engagement to focused analysis. Furthermore, visual information tends to be perceived as true, which has sparked a debate over the role of the humanities in the design and interpretation of visualizations, understanding data as interpretive and calling for more ambiguity in their graphical expression <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We propose the notion of the fold, advanced by French philosopher Gilles Deleuze <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, as a new way of interpreting and creating interactive visualizations of complex information spaces. The fold sheds light on the complexity of the underlying data and offers a new perspective on knowledge systems and their representation. While written in dense philosophical prose, the concept of the fold and the associated operations explication, implication, and complication can serve as an illuminating lens on visual interfaces and their interactive capabilities. More specifically, we believe that the fold offers an evocative design and research vocabulary for the digital humanities that considers encoding and interaction aspects in unison. We specifically want to bridge the theoretical and practical threads of the digital humanities, which have been criticized for falling short in offering inclusive, critical, and research-driven concepts that can serve as a guideline for their practice <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>With this research, we transfer Deleuze’s notion of the fold to data visualization and derive three concrete qualities for visualization design and critique in the humanities: coherence, elasticity, and infinity. In a next step, we characterize the manifestation of the fold’s operations and qualities in a range of exemplary visualizations with the help of interpretive illustrations and concrete examples from digital humanities projects. Lastly, we formulate a critical framework consisting of principles and questions for the design and interpretation of interactive visualizations and discuss open questions for future work at the intersection of data visualization design and humanistic inquiry.</p>
<h2 id="related-work">Related Work</h2>
<p>This research is largely motivated by a recent surge of work on the visualization of cultural heritage data, for which numerous visualization approaches have already been proposed, yielding an abundance of visual interfaces and representation techniques <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Shneiderman’s widely cited visual information seeking mantra  “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> may still hold, to a certain extent, but it has already been challenged by alternative approaches that aim for serendipitous discovery, generous views, open exploration, and bottom-up analysis <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. However, a departure from the primacy of the overview requires a careful reconsideration of the place for interactivity in data visualization. For instance, while a lot of effort is put into the design of online collections of museums, navigation oftentimes ends in impasses and the focus is set too much on single objects instead of relations and references <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. While casual users might benefit from such a reduced visual complexity, the enabling and integration of humanist inquiry through and into visualizations still proves to be challenging <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. We aim to continue this line of research and focus more closely on the role of interactivity in visualization of cultural heritage data.</p>
<p>To this end, a range of techniques and methods have been proposed. The visualization of complex datasets, among other, calls for the careful choice of visual variables and encodings <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, the dynamic arrangement of elements between display states <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and the interpretive comparison of data elements and properties to reveal relationships and differences <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. However, when working with high-dimensional data, the identification and interpretation of meaningful patterns and relationships can be a daunting enterprise. For this, dimensionality reduction has become an important method for the visual analysis of datasets containing multiple data dimensions and elements <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Nevertheless, the resulting low-dimensional layouts can be difficult to interpret and imply a range of projection errors <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. For dimensionality reduction to become more useful, novel interaction techniques need to be devised that support iterative and exploratory data analysis <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The iterative analysis of data can be thought of as an ongoing information practice that exhibits the characteristics of  “flow” , i.e., high levels of concentration, immersion, and motivation <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Relating this and other theories <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> to data visualization, the concept of fluid interaction puts forward a user experience during which people smoothly navigate through a visual interface, which supports an efficient and enjoyable sensemaking process <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. So far, an operationalization of such aspirational concepts in visualization design proves to be difficult, especially in the sense of making the animated display changes comprehensible <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. While graphical animations which represent temporal change in data can be challenging to comprehend <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, several studies show that animated transitions can support the perception of data visualizations and comprehend display changes <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. However, the often used staggered animations are not generally beneficial for visually tracking the elements during display changes <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. We are especially interested in not only making display changes perceptible but also how meaning can be encoded into the viewer-driven animations resulting from interactive use of a visualization.</p>
<p>In all this, we are guided by a growing critical awareness about graphical interfaces <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, data visualization <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>, and data themselves <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. Questions of how to include critical approaches and diverse voices into their projects <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, as well as how to take an ethical approach to the creation and use of data visualizations <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> have concerned the digital humanities particularly. From a study of digital humanities visualizations, Parry found that most project descriptions and media coverage underlined the picturing and illustrating characteristic of visualizations <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>, while the interpretive analysis and critique of their performative materiality has largely remained an aspiration <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. Instead, Parry calls for the use of enactment practices in data visualization, both in their conception and production as well as analysis and critique <sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. With this work, we want to join these authors in their aspirations by conceptualizing the fold for data visualization, providing both a theoretical framework for critique as well as a metaphor for practical implementation.</p>
<h2 id="the-fold">The Fold</h2>
<p>In the following, we briefly introduce Gilles Deleuze’s concept of the fold, in which he links Leibniz’ baroque idea of monadology to postmodernism <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Specifically, we focus on transferring some of Deleuze’s thoughts on perception and information accumulation to the case of data visualization, drawing mainly from the first part of The Fold and abstracting vocabulary and concrete functional illustrations. Philosophy, in Deleuze’s sense, creates concepts, and concepts produce an orientation or direction for thinking <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. In this spirit, we examine the fold’s operations, as proposed by Deleuze, to speculatively extend them into the realm of digital information spaces and devise tentative principles for interactivity in data visualization. The connection of Leibniz’ philosophical ideas to the fine arts and postmodernist thinking has already been pointed out by Deleuze himself, as well as others <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. We aim to show how Deleuze’s ideas about the baroque concept of monadology, and his postmodern take on the fold, open up promising avenues for the design and interpretation of interactive visualizations.</p>
<h2 id="thinking-through-the-manifold">Thinking through the Manifold</h2>
<p>In  “The Fold. Leibniz and the Baroque”  (1988), Deleuze (1925-1995) refers back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz’ (1646-1716) concept of monadology, which rejected a dualist ontology (i.e., separation of body and soul) and instead established the monad as the basic building block of the material world <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. Leibniz had also briefly introduced the metaphor of the fold as  “a way to differentiate matter without introducing discontinuity”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Deleuze now reconstructs Leibniz’ philosophy as baroque metaphysics, an  “allegory of the world”  which in his sense contains the fold as an element of infinite iteration <sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> to which postmodernism is deeply attached and from which it can benefit in terms of thinking the complex, or, with Deleuze’s metaphor, the manifold <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Deleuze proposes a new empiricism that is based on a theory of difference and multiplicity as fundamental forces <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>, stating that monadologic systems are composed of infinite folds, which consequently form the smallest unit of matter <sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The monad is filled with folds on two levels: the  “pleats of matter”  and the  “folds in the soul,”  which are distinct and still continuously interwoven. This metaphor also refers to the human body and soul, making the distinction important for the understanding of the processes of information interpretation and accumulation: following Deleuze, the monad (or human) already holds all information, twisted into many folds. If it was confronted with a new question or information on the level of the pleats of matter, through the senses, the folds in the soul would automatically begin to twist and turn, after which the resulting answer or links to other information would suddenly become visible. The answer was already there, it was only hidden in the manifold twists of the soul.</p>
<p>While Deleuze’s treatment of the fold is rather extensive and, in parts, elusive, his description of the unfolding of information offers a useful vocabulary for the conceptualization of (digital) information spaces. The related notion of the monad has already been proposed as a unique perspective on social systems by Bruno Latour and colleagues <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. For them, the monad usefully complicates the distinction between whole and part, a perspective that has been put forward as an iterative mode of making sense of relational information spaces <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. For Deleuze, this complication is concretely manifested in the fold. He proposes a division of the world into the  “actual”  and the  “virtual,”  which are mutually dependent and connected through folds, just as the monad is divided into pleats of matter and soul, but still continuously interwoven. Although Deleuze may not have meant virtual in the sense of digital, the concept of the fold holds a powerful metaphor for the structure and understanding of digital information spaces, in which only certain parts of the available information are perceptible at a time, while the whole information space remains invisibly present. Following Deleuze, the folds of information exist in the virtual world mostly, because they are potentially infinite and offer an unlimited range of capabilities. Still, everything within the monadologic system is connected, although not always ascertainable <sup id="fnref1:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Furthermore, the processes of information accumulation and analysis are to some extent characterized by unpredictability, as the reasons for thought processes and actions stay hidden from the monad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the world is in the monad, each monad includes every series of the states of the world; but, because the monad is for the world, no one clearly contains the ‘reason’ of the series of which they are all a result, and which remains outside of them, just like the principle of their accord.<br>
<sup id="fnref4:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="operations-of-the-fold">Operations of the Fold</h2>
<p>For Deleuze, the three operations  “Explication–implication–complication”  form the essential triad of the fold <sup id="fnref5:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The first two, explication and implication, need to be understood as a pair of which one is reversing the other. Deleuze describes them as processes of envelopment and development, focusing subsequently on the monad as an inflection of the world. To make this process of folding and flexing more vivid, we have abstracted illustrations inspired by Deleuze’s own use of black-and-white drawings in The Fold (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). Explication describes the process of unfolding, e.g., opening a book, dividing something into its subsections, or fanning out its multiple facets (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>, left). On the opposite, implication refers to the commonly known process of folding that reduces something in size and detail, e.g., closing an open book or folding a paper. Deleuze draws our attention closely to these processes within monadic systems: If something inside the monad is hidden through the process of implication, what is folded still comprises everything else, though this is not always perceivable with the human senses. Through the process of explication, hidden connections become visible again, but the (un)folded entity nevertheless possesses connections to all others. Unpredictable outcomes and new connections can occur during folding and unfolding, as a fold can generate the sudden juxtaposition of formerly opposite (and also opposing) points.</p>

        <p>The operations of the fold illustrated: Explication &amp; implication (left), and complication (right).
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the intersection of the fold and monadologic theory, Deleuze introduces complication as the third operation of the fold (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>, right). Here, he draws from medieval philosopher Nicholas of Cusa (1401-1464) to explain the all-embracing function of folds for the mind and the matter. For Cusa, everything that was outside the perceivable was divine simplicity, which he defined as a  “true folding”  of the opposite and contradictory, and named it  “complicatio”   <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. In this thought system, whenever something was inexplicable to humans, it was the complicated god that was able to explain things outside of causal connections and rational thought. Deleuze shifts the process of complication from the divine sphere as outside to the inside of human information processing via his theory of the fold. The operation of complication thus explains the process of information accumulation and connectedness of everything perceivable, while also addressing its arbitrariness. Because everything inside the monad is folded to infinity, every possibility already lies inside of it, yet, it cannot expose itself in its entirety at any moment. Surprising occurrences are thus not more than a complicated folding process, in which connections are rearranged and only a part of the connected universe becomes visible at a time.</p>
<p>The perpetual incompleteness of any knowledge is what makes this theory so relevant for information representation, which aims to communicate complex matters, but needs to make its omissions and reductions transparent. Folding processes can disclose and even simplify ‘complicated’ occurrences: the moment of collapsing an angle from 1 degree to 0 degree, when the eye can visually follow the angle turning into a line, describes this process best. After having observed the transition, the resulting line is not only a line but consists of two layers and could still be seen as an angle; it comprises multiple folds of information that we can only capture if we are able to follow and understand the operation of the fold.</p>
<h2 id="qualities-of-the-fold">Qualities of the Fold</h2>
<p>“&hellip; an elastic body still has cohering parts that form a fold, such that they are not separated into parts of parts but are rather divided to infinity in smaller and smaller folds that always retain a certain cohesion.”   <sup id="fnref6:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br>
In addition to the concrete operations of the fold, Deleuze’s opus constitutes a unique and global proposition about the form and function of information spaces. To relate the fold theory with visualization practice, we have abstracted three overarching qualities – coherence, elasticity, and infinity – that align the fold with interactive data visualizations in the context of humanistic inquiry.</p>
<h2 id="coherence">Coherence</h2>
<p>Instead of considering information ‘points’ as discrete objects, the fold expresses the coherent quality of monadologic systems that are defined by context and relations. Accordingly, the single data point in a visualization stands for more than one expression, it is part of a system and defined through its connections to other points of the network. As stated by Deleuze in the opening quote of this section, this quality multiplies itself infinitely: No matter how far the information space is passed through, each finding, output, or information point possesses a relation to the beginning of the journey and the whole universe. The quality of coherence thus includes outcomes and object pairings which might seem opposed, since every connection forms an everlasting part of the fold.</p>
<h2 id="elasticity">Elasticity</h2>
<p>This quality captures the ongoing change in an information space, the twisting and turning of information and connections, with one impulse following another. With regard to thought processes, elasticity becomes apparent: Thoughts sometimes stretch and flow unconsciously and casually, sometimes quickly and targeted, but they are continuously changing their form and direction. The same principle should be applied to visualization elements: Through their ability to fold, individual elements and entire arrangements can assume multiple possible manifestations, are flexible in their position and appearance, but never lose the first principle of coherence. Elasticity thus describes a material quality that is situated between fluidity and hardness, i.e., neither lacking coherence nor being fully rigid.</p>
<h2 id="infinity">Infinity</h2>
<p>The fold surprises with its infinite possibilities; the outcomes of folding operations appear to be unlimited. Smaller and smaller threads can be unfolded in a visualization, or connections between elements can be found and followed in a multitude of possible combinations. This does not imply that the actions and events in information spaces are not also repeatable or retraceable, but rather that folding operations are never final or completed. The same holds true for the underlying datasets that may never be sufficiently comprehensive to represent an artefact or collection. There are always further data perspectives that could, in theory, be invoked for interpretation. The quality of infinity is especially connected with the operation of complication and reminds us that comprehensive information spaces might seem structured and transparent at first glance, but are highly dependent on the perspective of the viewer and a multitude of data dimensions. Because the fold offers (potentially) infinite possibilities of twisting and turning, folding processes remain unpredictable and serendipitous <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. If we accept the (partly) unpredictable folds of large information spaces by learning to follow their implication, explication, or complication, we can come to a deeper understanding of our own thought processes and actions, and see the connectedness of every single point that came before and comes after.</p>
<h2 id="the-fold-in-interactive-visualizations">The Fold in Interactive Visualizations</h2>
<p>In the context of information visualization, interactivity has been largely viewed through the lens of users tasks and intents <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>, distinctly separate from the visual representation of data and animated transitions between views. In Deleuze’s description of information processing lies an opportunity to conceptualize visualizations in a novel framework that rejects the separation between interactivity and visual encoding, just as the monad rejects the dualistic distinction between body and soul. We aim at highlighting an encompassing practice of visualization for the digital humanities, which have to find visual representations for their collections and datasets, while on the other hand conceptualizing interactivity with tasks as casual exploration or deep analysis in mind. While various visualization techniques already refer to folds or folding in their project descriptions or prototypes [e.g., <a href="#bach2016">Bach et al. 2016</a>, <a href="#dork2014">Dörk et al. 2014</a>, <a href="#riehmann2018">Riehmann et al. 2018</a>, <a href="#zhao2014">Zhao et al. 2014</a>], we will demonstrate that current visualization practice actually provides a variety of interaction patterns that align with the principles of the fold and can serve as an inspiration for digital humanities scholars. Accordingly, with this research, we do not present new visualization techniques, but explore a new way to conceptualize interactivity in data visualization.</p>
<p>Designing visualizations along the fold means to understand information spaces as elastic, coherent, and potentially infinite systems. Instead of focusing on static snapshots of visualizations, which would favor their visual encoding, the fold sheds more light on the in-between states of folding processes, emphasizing the transitions between visualization states as meaningful views that need to be considered throughout the entire design process. In a design study, we have already described this process by means of a book collection from the 19th century, focusing on a set of functions which enable what we call  “scalable exploration”   <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. With this work, we want to widen the focus of the design framework to questions of perception, interpretation, and critique with the help of Deleuze’s philosophy. Data and the resulting representations in data visualization can be seen as folds, reminding us that any perspective can only represent one possible version of reality, while containing infinite other possibilities to perceive a phenomenon. This is especially relevant for visualization practices in the digital humanities, which aim at implementing inherently humanist research questions into their visual interfaces and have spiked discussions on the problem that data are never neutral <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This section presents examples of folding operations in data visualizations through abstracted illustrations and will subsequently demonstrate how the fold’s qualities can form the basis of a critical framework for their design and analysis. We reference existing visualization examples, which have inspired us in the creation of the illustrations and encourage readers to visit them to gain a deeper understanding of the various mechanisms of the fold.</p>

<h2 id="studying-visualizations-through-fold-operations">Studying Visualizations through Fold Operations</h2>
<p>Arguably, explication and implication as the first two operations of the fold are common mechanisms in data visualizations, implementing the fold in the sense of increasing or decreasing detail, aggregating or separating, clustering or dispersing, etc. In particular, semantic zoom <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> already supports the operations of the fold by allowing different degrees of granularity while preserving the overall context. <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a> illustrates explication and implication for three typical visualization techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong>  An interactive mechanism common in network visualizations is selecting a node in a graph to trigger an explication, which unfolds into multiple sub-items and thus provides a more granular view on a selection [e.g., <a href="#morris2018">Morris 2018</a>]. Network graphs like this are popular in the digital humanities, for instance when visualizing relationships between authors as in this visualization of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s social network: <a href="https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/graph?id=sfz53095">https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/graph?id=sfz53095</a>  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. On the other side, implication describes the process of reducing a set of items into a collapsed item leading to the reduction of the overall visual complexity.</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong>  The explication in a temporal streamgraph stretches an area of interest to display more detail, while compressing the rest of the visualization, similar to the mechanics of an accordion. Focus+Context like accordion drawing or a fish-eye technique is oftentimes used to provide a detailed view on a specific area of interest within a visualization while preserving its context [e.g., <a href="#baur2012">Baur et al. 2012</a>, <a href="#cuenca2018">Cuenca et al. 2018</a>, <a href="#morawa2014">Morawa et al. 2014</a>, <a href="#riehmann2018">Riehmann et al. 2018</a>, <a href="#slack2005">Slack et al. 2005</a>]. As one of the main focus of interest, timeline visualizations have been put into practice with this kind of compression technique, as in the  “Touch the Time”  project (<a href="https://www.uni-weimar.de/projekte/vr-scratch/videos/TTT.mp4">https://www.uni-weimar.de/projekte/vr-scratch/videos/TTT.mp4</a>) <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>.</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong>  The visualization of hierarchical data demonstrates a combination of the two previous mechanisms: Through selection of a tree branch, both the number of elements and the level of detail can be increased, while at the same time the branches that are not selected get compressed to provide sufficient space for the newly unfolded subbranches [e.g., <a href="#slack2005">Slack et al. 2005</a>]. Relating to humanistic data, one case study is an expandable word tree that enables new ways of text exploration by giving the possibility to move along sequences of words through expansion and reduction of following or preceding words <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. Using such a word tree, it is, for instance, possible to gradually unfold all possible sentences that start with the name Alice in an interactive word tree version of the book  <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> : <a href="https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/?source=alice-in-wonderland.txt%20">https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/?source=alice-in-wonderland.txt</a>  <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup></li>

</figure>
<p>In contrast to explication and implication, which correspond to established interaction techniques, the operation of complication introduces a conceptual approach to high-dimensional data visualization that is relatively seldom considered. Dimensionality reductions and force-directed layouts can be misleading, error-prone, or difficult to grasp, yet, the gradual build-up of a multidimensional visualization can be viewed as a continuous complication (see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong>  A linear timeline arranges events solely on the basis of their temporal succession (top). The gradual inclusion of additional event data constitutes a complication, in that further aspects are introduced that differentiate and relate the items (from middle to bottom): The straight line is folded into a curve that positions similar events closer together, using, for example, multidimensional scaling, as in the Time Curves technique (<a href="https://aviz.fr/~bbach/timecurves">https://aviz.fr/~bbach/timecurves</a>) <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>.</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong>  The two-dimensional visualization of a dataset as a scatterplot (top) can be gradually complicated by the introduction of flower-like glyphs encoding multiple dimensions per element [e.g., <a href="#kammer2018">Kammer et al. 2018</a>, <a href="#stefaner2014">Stefaner et al. 2014</a>] and by similarity-based positioning. With sliders on the left, each dimension’s influence on the layout can be adjusted [e.g., <a href="#goldenberg2017">Goldenberg 2017</a>, <a href="#stefaner2014">Stefaner et al. 2014</a>] (middle and bottom). As an example, such a similarity-based visualization of a country map, calculated through the t-SNE algorithm, lets the user choose between the various factors influencing the layout: <a href="https://projects.interacta.io/country-tsne">https://projects.interacta.io/country-tsne</a>  <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>]. Furthermore, this project offers a great example of disclosing its mechanisms through a narrative layer which leads visitors through the process under the title  “Understanding the data” .</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong>  An egocentric network centered around one node (top) can be a starting point <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> to gradually expand the analysis from a partial to a comprehensive perspective. The complication dissolves the egocentric perspective towards a full view of the network in which the layout is influenced by all nodes and all links become visible (bottom). Similarly, another common approach is the reversed switch from global to egocentric views [e.g., <a href="#ortiz2013">Ortiz 2013</a>]. In the project  “Six degrees of Francis Bacon”  (<a href="http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/">http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com</a>) <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>, it is possible to change the view from a global, forced-directed network graph that is useful to see general patterns and the general network structure, to an egocentric view. Here, the related nodes are arranged on two rings around a selection, based on their degree of separation, making it easier to differentiate between direct and indirect relations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to visualization techniques that separate dimensions into multiple coordinated views or enforce an abrupt display change, complication suggests traceable transitions between successive visualization states, which gradually integrate additional data aspects into the same visualization. To think of multidimensional data visualizations as dynamic processes of data complications instead of a static image of reality can help identify the various factors influencing the visual representation and make interactive functions more comprehensible. For instance, a complicated timeline which positions similar data points next to each other, forming a curve while allowing users to follow the process of bending, sparks questions about the linearity of timelines per se and the underlying structure and dimensions of the dataset.</p>
<h2 id="towards-a-critical-framework">Towards a Critical Framework</h2>
<p>Considering the examples above, the fold’s operations help to identify the interactive mechanisms of a visualization and examine their role in transforming the appearance and arrangement of visual elements. Furthermore, the three operations can be used to spot the lack of interactive capabilities or conceive dynamic behaviors for visualizations being created. Here the fold does not only offer principles for the design of and interactions with visualizations, but also enables us to think about the potential and challenges of humanistic data. Building on Deleuze’s writing and related visualization research [e.g., <a href="#elmqvist2011">Elmqvist et al. 2011</a>], we now formulate tentative design principles and questions, thereby following the operations of the fold but especially relating its newly defined qualities to the critical enquiry of data visualizations.</p>
<h2 id="consistent-coupling">Consistent Coupling</h2>
<p>The fold’s coherence manifests itself in the deep contextualization and connectedness of all elements. In order to realize this high degree of coherence in interactive visualizations, the visual encoding and interactive features need to be consistently coupled across all views. Coherence means, for example, that one information point stands in relation to every other point within the visualization, and the context of those relations is both visually and interactively represented. For example, in cultural heritage collections, artifacts might be related to each other through many different explicit (e.g., same author) or implicit (e.g., sharing a subject) relations over a multitude of possible data dimensions (e.g., attributes, visual similarity, temporal sequences). Integration of coherence in visualization is not only dependent on abstract relations but mainly visible in the form of visual cues and linkages that reveal how elements are connected and invite the viewer to follow them.</p>
<p><em>Question 1: How are the connections between data elements, visual encodings, and interactive features exposed?</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, the quality of coherence is particularly promoted by consistent design decisions across the entire visualization, regardless of its dynamic state. As a person interacts with the visualization, the coupling of visual representation and interactivity consistently holds. Similarly, the behaviors of interaction techniques function consistently across all views. Visual variables, such as color, shape or position, that are added to encode additional dimensions should not stand in conflict with existing encodings. Humanities scholars conceptualizing visualizations should therefore pay attention to different states of the visualization (e.g., overview – detail), which interactive functions can be used at which states, and watch out for the application of them throughout a visitor’s journey – for instance when applying filters to a dataset and changing to a different zoom position afterwards.</p>
<p><em>Question 2: How consistent are visual encodings and interactive techniques across all views, throughout multiple continuous states?</em></p>
<p>When reducing many points into a single point, elements should not be removed, but be folded while preserving the respective relation to the remaining elements. The implication or explication does not only influence a discrete element but also has an effect on the whole visualization, indicating the overall coherence of the information space. When visual features are reduced or when elements are collapsed, the design of the respective transitions should be meaningful and consistent. Similarly, elements being added should appear from logical positions in the interface.</p>
<p><em>Question 3: Do the arrival and departure of elements in the display convey the concept of object permanence?</em></p>
<h2 id="constrained-fluidity">Constrained Fluidity</h2>
<p>A high degree of elasticity means that elements are flexibly embedded into a complex visual appearance and arrangement and that they are able to change their shape and leave their position to appear elsewhere. They are not static and can show themselves anew repeatedly – and, also in unforeseen representations. For example, objects in visualizations of cultural collections can have multiple relations to each other but are often assigned a static position in web-based interfaces. Instead, it could be helpful to include flexible positions and to consider a range of visual representations, moving between abstract shapes to more concrete images of an object. However, the fold is neither erratic nor random. The changes carried out through folding operations should be comprehensible and meaningful.</p>
<p><em>Question 4: To which degree are fluidity and rigidness balanced so that the elements and arrangements accommodate all possible values and relations in a dataset?</em></p>
<p>The spectrum of dynamic changes to individual elements and entire arrangements needs to be carefully considered. To do this it is paramount to view visual encodings not as static mappings between data dimensions and visual variables, but as complex sequences modulated by the fold’s operations. Accordingly, like a blooming flower, the additional data dimensions in <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a> b) are already comprised in the data points and their revelation demonstrates their elasticity.</p>
<p><em>Question 5: Are the elements and arrangements designed with regard to their dynamic behaviors, i.e., their intermediate states?</em></p>
<p>Humanistic data is oftentimes shaped by various forms of uncertainty, subjectivity, and ambiguity <sup id="fnref3:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Nevertheless, since such data properties are difficult to address in visualizations <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> and might significantly increase complexity, they are oftentimes omitted completely in visualizations. The elasticity of elements might help to reveal such data properties through folding operations on demand for specific elements. Thus it is possible to critically analyze the datasets beforehand, but even more so during the visualization process. It should be tested whether a visualization shows what researchers expected to see from the dataset or whether it can reveal new qualities in the data through new views and interactive functions.</p>
<p><em>Question 6: Does the representation of the data through the visualization constrain interpretive qualities of the data, such as uncertainty or ambiguity, that could be dissolved through interactivity and elasticity of the encoding?</em></p>
<h2 id="linked-perspectives">Linked Perspectives</h2>
<p>The quality of infinity relates to a multitude of possible representations of data, the insights they may evoke, and circular or open-ended navigation mechanisms. Specific combinations of visual form and interactive functionality in a visualization can evoke new, surprising, and inspiring expressions of a dataset and a variety of possibly unexpected insights, surprises, and serendipitous discoveries. The quality of infinity can be observed, for example, in <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>  b) through the seemingly infinite combination possibilities within the weightings of the multiple dimensions.</p>
<p><em>Question 7: Do all visual elements in the interface afford interactivity to transform the view and generate new insights?</em></p>
<p>An interactive visualization is never complete, but always in progress. If a data visualization could be thought of as a densely connected network of linked perspectives, at any given point in the network of possible visualization states, users ideally should never be led to dead-ends. For instance, unfolding detail in <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>  b) and c) will always lead to an impression of other information while preserving the context and therefore allowing for open-ended interactions without the need to resort to the browser’s back-button.</p>
<p><em>Question 8: How is the incompleteness of views embraced and endless traversal of the data encouraged?</em></p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Arguably, a lot of thought during the design process goes into the visual representation of a visualization, i.e., the mapping from various data dimensions to a limited number of visual variables, whereas interaction techniques and animated transitions are oftentimes only an afterthought, sometimes even used as a last fix to solve issues of a visual encoding. Similarly, the interpretation of data visualizations is almost exclusively focused on the visual representation – the rules of turning data qualities into graphical elements – often disregarding the dynamic interplay between display parameters and interactive capabilities. With the fold we put forward an approach that emphasizes a need for simultaneous and coordinated consideration of interaction and representation in data visualization. In the process, we identified the connections between visual encoding and interactivity as crucial for the implementation of the folding operations and emphasized them in the critical framework, arguing for a close consideration of visual appearance and its dynamic behavior.</p>
<p>However, prototyping interfaces may in parts still be restricted by static forms of prototyping techniques, a lack of suitable tools, or a massive amount of data. Additionally, thinking of representation and interaction in all states of a visualization in unison with the intention to achieve meaningful transitions may turn out to demand significant conceptual, technical, and intellectual effort. While realistically seeing the complexity that the fold brings to visualization practice in the digital humanities, we believe that its notion can have a profound effect on the way we think about data, and even in its smallest implementation can contribute to more profound and purposeful visualizations.</p>
<p>Proposing the use of the fold and its operations to approach a gap in the development of data visualization, we recommend the consideration of the qualities coherence, elasticity, and infinity as fruitful starting points for both creation and critique. Nevertheless, these qualities only describe an ideal environment for the fold. In practice, their degree of implementation might always be partially limited. While we have provided a first framework for their implementation in digital humanities projects and research, we are aware that the applied methods are highly dependent on the actual data and project setting. Furthermore, the interpretation of data visualization remains deeply subjective. Especially machine-generated arrangements, for instance, based on similarity, might need a high amount of testing and editing, or even a narrative layer, to arrive at comprehensible, yet “complicated” visualizations in the sense of the fold. Additionally, we would like to see more research into the perception and necessities of different user groups in digital humanities visualizations.</p>
<p>Although this research mainly focused on the implementation of the fold through a new perspective on the design and interpretation of visualizations, we also see the potential of the fold when it comes to their very foundation: data. Thinking of Deleuze’s infinite folds, the common approach to data as given  <sup id="fnref4:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, implicitly perceived as objective and fixed, could also be understood as one folded impression of reality. We believe that the fold offers a unique perspective for digital humanities scholars to translate their datasets into interactive visualizations along various meaningful views, which can generate new insights for their research and help them in conveying it to the public. This perspective becomes especially relevant if we take a look at more recent developments concerning critical perspectives on the power and rhetoric of data and their visualization <sup id="fnref2:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>. Here, we are specifically calling for a close consideration of theoretical concepts and a practical collaboration between data visualization research and the digital humanities to rethink the relationship between representation and interactivity in data visualization.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As data visualization continues to expand its relevance in the digital humanities, there is a growing need to come to terms with interactivity as one of its most fundamental aspects. While the challenges of cultural heritage data and the complexity of their implementation into dynamic visualizations has gained critical attention, the prospects of interaction techniques to this end are not discussed as intensely. With this research, we proposed the notion of the fold as a productive way to jointly consider interaction and encoding in data visualization. While generally understood as an essential component of data visualization, interactivity is often treated in separation from the visual encoding and as a second step in the design process, when all decisions about the visual variables have already been made. This relegation of interactivity is perpetuated in the critical interpretation of data visualization that is similarly focused on the visual encoding and lacks the vocabulary to make sense of the provided interactive capabilities. Drawing from Deleuze’s writing on the fold, we formulated a critical framework for interactive data visualization consisting of operations, qualities, and questions for their design and interpretation. In this context, we do not only hope to encourage consideration of folding operations for the visualization of data, but especially see the importance of understanding information spaces and the data themselves as a manifold space. In order to treat interfaces as subject to critique and interpretation <sup id="fnref5:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>, the lens of the fold provides a useful thinking tool for a humanistic approach to data visualization.</p>
<p>To investigate the viability of the fold for the critical consideration of existing visualizations, we abstracted new, explanatory illustrations from various visualization examples. It was our aim to examine in which functions the fold was already manifested in data visualization practice. During this process, we noticed that a considerable number of the visualization techniques exhibited the characteristics of the fold, while certain aspects are still underdeveloped and could be explored in future research and design. While the pair of implication and explication can be seen in numerous visualization examples, we see a necessity and, through the notion of the fold, an opportunity for designing visualizations that offer insightful complications, more specifically through meaningful transitions. This is particularly important when visualizing digital cultural heritage data, where multidimensional and multifaceted collections or datasets offer intriguing opportunities for the joint design of interactive exploration and visual representation. Based on the operations and qualities of the fold, we have formulated a critical framework as an invitation to jointly consider the interactive capabilities and visual representations of data in visualization techniques in the digital humanities. Coherence, elasticity, and infinity are valuable qualities for the design of interactive visualizations that can trigger unexpected and surprising insights – the raison d’être of data visualization.</p>

<p>Owen Hannaway defined a science laboratory as a place that  “involves observation and manipulation of nature by means of specialized instruments, techniques, and apparatuses that require manual skills as well as conceptual knowledge for their construction and deployment”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A scientific laboratory implies a physical location, material instruments, equipment, and hands-on skills for knowledge production. With the proliferation and diversification of laboratories in city space, in cultural institutions (libraries and museums), in the virtual environment, and on the university campus, this definition seems difficult to maintain. One realization of labs that resists this elucidation is a humanities lab. A laboratory has emerged in the humanities as part of their rich infrastructure that includes a library and archive, the seminar and workshop, the classroom, the graduate program, the conference, the university press, the journal, the academic newsletter, etc. These all have been and remained institutional forms for the production of knowledge in the humanities. However, in recent years, we have observed how the present forms of infrastructure have been renamed laboratories: a library’s reading room at Yale University Library has been redesigned as the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory, the University of Arizona College of Humanities has launched a new set of courses as the Humanities Lab, and research groups and seminars have been called a laboratory, for instance, Representing Migration Humanities Lab in the English Department at Duke University. The humanities labs have been built upon different types of existing infrastructure giving rise to new forms of their realization and interpretation. They include situated and virtual digital humanities labs as well as non-digital, seminar- and project-based humanities labs.</p>
<p>In this essay, I argue thus that the idea of a laboratory has been expanded and altered by social initiatives, such as library creative spaces, makerspaces, and hackathons. A laboratory goes beyond the notion of a physical place dedicated to scientific exploration, becoming, instead, a widely understood  <em>project</em>  (lab as concept, initiative, and program) focused on labbing problems (the approach to solve problems by applying the practices of labs; see more <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>). Seen as a project, it insinuates that society is, in a certain sense, in a projection state, seeking new ways to tackle local and global challenges. The shift from a  _ laboratory as a physical location_  to conceptual laboratory is thus crucial for the discussion of a new cultural paradigm. Referring to Thomas S. Kuhn’s paradigm concept <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, the laboratory turn entails fundamental changes in the practices and function of the humanities at large.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to track the path of the formation of the laboratory turn in the humanities and understand the conditions, meanings, and functions of humanities labs situated in North America, North-Western Europe, and Australia. In the first part of the article, I analyse briefly three discourses that gave rise to the emergence of a laboratory in the humanities: the transformation of the humanities infrastructure within the university, paradigm shifts in the social sciences, and the expansion of cultural categories of innovation, the maker movement, and the notion of community. Next, I present a history of the laboratory in the humanities and examine a wide range of application of the term laboratory to the humanities that cover institutional and technology-based labs (physical and virtual spaces engaging digital tools and technologies) and conceptual, non-digital labs (entities and projects that call themselves labs and don’t have an explicitly digital component). Drawing on this analysis, I indicate five models for humanities labs based on laboratories’ statements and operations: the center-type lab, the techno-science lab, the work station-type lab, the social challenges-centric lab, and virtual lab. These five types of laboratories grew out of various origins and discourses. The goal is thus to grasp the complex landscape of the humanities labs, comprehend their functions, and reflect on their development and features. The result section presents the main findings of the research related to the emergence of the laboratory turn, the uniqueness of the humanities labs, and the implications of labs for the positioning of the humanities both within and outside of academia.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure-changes-in-the-humanities">Infrastructure Changes in the Humanities</h2>
<p>By looking at the history of the humanities, we can discern moments of significant shifts occurring at the time of cultural, social, and economic changes. Each significant moment in the history of higher education — the beginning of the twentieth century, the 1960s/1970s, the 1980s/1990s, and 2007/2008 — is hailed as a transformation period for the humanities (see more about the history of university and humanities: e.g., <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>). The discipline is seen as a reactive field seeking to adapt to new conditions and needs. One method which can be used to reimagine and strengthen the humanities is institutional change that entails new organizational structures and, alongside these structures, new research practices. Here, I outline briefly the infrastructural transformations which have been taking place in the U.S. since the 1980s/1990s. However, prior to doing so, it is worth recalling the most significant institutional change which occurred in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>At that time, the humanities were under the influence of the growing scientification of knowledge. The humanities were strongly engaged in precise and analytical research typical for scientific discourses. As Julie Thompson Klein describes it,  “The tendency toward painstaking research and minute methodology became as evident in historiography as in science. The humanist’s equivalent of the laboratory was analytic abstraction, reinforced by description, classification, comparison, and compilation. Like laboratory specimens, humanistic objects could be manipulated, dissected, and embalmed; measured, counted, and calibrated; and subjected to precise methodologies”   <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. In a certain metaphorical sense, the scientific laboratory was the first place in which humanistic research determined its methodology and infrastructure. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the university developed the modern system of disciplinarity, which consequently contributed to the independence of the humanities discipline. The moment of separation of the humanities from science meant that the humanities could shape the discipline’s own methodology. This new independence of the humanities and the building of the discipline’s own physical place became a key moment in the history of the humanities. Departing from a laboratory methodology was accompanied by moving from a metaphorical laboratory towards an office and a library: spaces that for a long time served as the main places for humanities research.</p>
<p>Significant changes occurred in the 1980s as a result of the transformations in the academy. The phenomenon of mass universities, the weakening of disciplinary boundaries, and expanding globalization and corporatization led to a crisis in universities in the 1990s [e.g., <a href="#b%C3%A9rub%C3%A91995">Bérubé et al. 1995</a>, <a href="#readings1996">Readings 1996</a>]. This crisis rhetoric has started to penetrate any discussion about the university, which is attacked for its corporatization and ignoring social problems, as well as the state of the humanities, which is accused of being unprofitable and impractical. Under these conditions, the humanities were transforming gradually into an interdisciplinary field, engaged in sociological, political, cultural, and feminist discourses. The shift towards inter- and transdisciplinary practices and social engagement was accompanied by the symbolic gesture of moving the humanities  “beyond the walls of the office”  into the public domain. The humanities moved out of their usual spaces — the office and the library — into a new territory — the center — to intensify interdisciplinarity and public engagement. The implementation of new practices was thus reinforced by institutional changes. Consequently, since the 1980s, the humanities have established many centres, aiming to foster interdisciplinarity, build bridges with the medical, technical, and natural sciences, and create a common space for the university and the local community <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Next to the interdisciplinary research center, a new unit emerged with a focus on computing in the humanities. This center underpinned the development of humanities computing, renamed the digital humanities in the twentieth-first century. It played the role of a work station equipped with computers and other devices, gathering in the same place humanists, computer scientists, and programmers. However, the computing center was more than a physical work space; it was a significant ground for building new practices engaged in manipulating complex digital analysis tools and applying computing techniques. To advance computing within humanities practices, the discipline  “required institutional investment in an entirely different infrastructure of courseware specialists, on a large scale and at an urgent pace”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. These infrastructural changes were necessary in order to express these new practices within the humanities and, along with that, the new function and place of the humanities in the larger institutional arena. Therefore, the center played an important role in restructuring the humanities within the university as well as reconceptualizing the field as a meeting place for interdisciplinary researchers and the local community.</p>
<p>The university entered the twenty-first century along with the accelerating power of technology, the emerging cyberinfrastructure, and intensifying globalization and internationalization. The university of the twenty-first century is an economically-driven institution centred on applied, profitable, and competitive research and training students in order to provide them with practical and useful skills. Based on J. G. Wissema’s considerations of the third generation university, the academy of the twenty-first century is distinguished by seeking alternative funding for cutting-edge scientific research, intertwining the two worlds of academic and industrial research, operating in an internationally competitive market, and the commercialisation of knowledge <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. These technological, economic, and academic conditions have affected the humanities, which, particularly after 2007, entered a state of crisis. The humanities were seen as unproductive and out of touch with contemporary science and the technology culture, leading consequently to a decline in funding, reduction in the number of majors, and shrinking job market. Under these conditions, the humanities sought to find a strategy with which to reinforce their position. One of the implementations of the  “tactical humanities”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> is a  “scientification of the humanities”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>, i.e., moving the humanities closer to the sciences <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. The process of the scientification of the humanities has taken different forms, including the use of new research data and applied methodologies (qualitative methods, data mining), new research practices (collaboration, experimentation), new methods of evaluating research (parameterization, falsifiability, the ranking system of universities), as well as reconceiving institutions (forming laboratories).</p>
<p>Consequently, the humanities took a step towards revamping their infrastructure, aimed at fostering and enhancing growing computational, collaborative, and interdisciplinary practices. In this light, drawing on Amy E. Earhart’s reflections, a laboratory emerged in the humanities discipline as  “more than a space, but a symbol of our hope”   <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. It became a new institutional structure that was supposed to fuel the development of the humanities with new working models and research practices. The laboratory was intended to work as a driving force to develop a new model of the humanities based on collaboration, partnership, interdisciplinarity, situated practices, technology-focused work, and alternative, empirical education.</p>
<p>The laboratory idea was thus applied to the humanities field in response to its structural crisis; the existing infrastructure (offices, library, seminars) was insufficient to meet contemporary scholars needs, such as advancing collaborative and interdisciplinary research and fostering frequent meetings and interaction [e.g., <a href="#hiatt2005">Hiatt 2005</a>, <a href="#joselow2016">Joselow 2016</a>, <a href="#breithaupt2017">Breithaupt 2017</a>]. Therefore, a lab was not only seen as a new institutional unit for the humanities but also as a conceptual model for conducting research embedded and entailed in a laboratory’s set of practices. In  “Designing a Lab in the Humanities”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, Fritz Breithaupt described his experience in creating the Experimental Humanities Lab at Indiana University, Bloomington in 2015, which arose from simple weekly meetings that the students called lab meetings.  “Sure, we had done several joint presentations and written some small articles, with more pending. But was this a lab?” ; Breithaupt’s striking question shows that firstly, the concept of the humanities lab is still far from a clear definition, and, secondly, that the lab idea grows out of the simple necessity of frequent meetings and conversations as well as the need to work together instead of remaining isolated in offices. The term “lab” is thus used to imply specific values embedded in a particular place or initiative. However, this tactical naming strategy doesn’t necessarily transparently disclose the actual workings of knowledge production.</p>
<p>The impulse to establish laboratories in the humanities is also related strongly to the utilization of technology in research projects. Following the report of the American Council of Learned Societies Commission on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences,  “Our Cultural Commonwealth” , we can see that physical laboratories have been established as a place for facilitating new research practices (collaboration, experimentation, and interdisciplinarity), advocating technological innovation, and developing a robust cyberinfrastructure <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. A laboratory entails physical situatedness, i.e., work is performed in a particular place and context. Traditional models of humanistic research involve work in an office, a library, or at home since it is not attached to place and does not demand any particular equipment and devices. In contrast to this model, digital humanities require equipment, tools, and software that are accumulated and provided, physically and through licenses, in one space. This place gathers people from different disciplines and institutions: programmers, engineers, librarians, curators, and archivists. It becomes a work space for collaborative, interdisciplinary, and technology-based research. Thus, humanities research has been transformed from placeless and isolated work into the collaborative and situated practices of the digital humanities. As a result, the digital humanities have become the driving force behind building a laboratory space. This new vision of the humanities propelled the creation of laboratories with missions related strongly to the idea of reconstructing the humanities in the vein of technological innovations. Good examples are the following statements made by digital humanities labs:  “LINHD mission is to redefine the way of working in digital humanities by promoting innovation and technology in the environment of the new information society”   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> by the Digital Humanities Innovation Lab (LINHD) established at the National University of Distance Education in 2014, and  “We at the Price Lab believe that if the humanities are to survive and thrive, digital research tools for the imagined future of our various fields must be developed by scholars who possess expertise in both humanistic inquiry and digital technology”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> by Price Lab for Digital Humanities launched at the University of Pennsylvania in 2015.</p>
<p>Therefore, along with the development of the digital humanities, we can track the infrastructural changes in the humanities of the twenty-first century as moving from a center <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> to a laboratory <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. The years after 2010 are particularly significant period in the history of the laboratory. First, we have experienced tremendous growth in numbers of labs launched in the academic and societal areas. Second, 2010 was proclaimed to be the year of  “the death of the centre”   <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, which was now seen as an unsustainable place in which to house collective activities within the humanities. Third, in 2010, the Franklin Humanities Institute (FHI) at Duke University founded the Humanities Laboratories, heralded as a  “new architecture of multiple humanities laboratories”   <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. This structure marked the beginning of a new model for a laboratory in the humanities as one that was created for a fixed period and a specific purpose, but which was not particularly related to physical situatedness and not necessarily involved a digital component. This model gave rise to conceptual laboratories, which were seen more as projects and programs entailing different types of learning and research practices in the humanities rather than physical work spaces. The good examples of conceptual labs are Humanities Labs at Colby College, which were launched as innovative courses in 2014 <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. The notion of the laboratory is used in terms of new modes of research and community outreach which do not necessarily require a fixed physical location and equipment. This significant change reflects the meaning of the laboratory turn: the lab does not refer to a physical place anymore; instead, it is related to a way of thinking, communicating, and working.</p>
<p>The last reason for the laboratory boom  after 2010 is related to the growing interest in the concept of community, public engagement, and do-it-yourself culture. It entails popping out labs as makerspaces and hackathons in the academic space (e.g., the Curtin Library Makerspace at Curtin University) as well as establishing labs in city space; for instance, OpenLab was launched as a  “challenge-driven innovation community”  by Karolinska Institute, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm University and Södertörn University in 2013 and located in the City of Stockholm <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="laboratory-studies-and-conceptual-changes-in-the-social-sciences">Laboratory Studies and Conceptual Changes in the Social Sciences</h2>
<p>The second discourse on the laboratory turn brings us back to the 1980s and 1990s when the conceptual shifts in the social sciences occurred. The new concepts had a significant impact on emerging new theories and the research approach of the twenty-first century. Based on Don Ihde’s reflections, the following theoretical changes are indicated: the emergence of the new sociology of scientific knowledge, namely, social constructionism and the actor-network theory of the 1970s; the new philosophy of technology in the 1980s; and the concept of science as a cultural practice in the late 1980s and 1990s <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. This concise timeline reveals the most significant shifts in the notion of science, namely, moving away from science as a knowledge towards science as a practice <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. As Hannaway claims:  “Science no longer was simply a kind of knowledge (one possessed scientia); it increasingly became a form of activity (one did science). That there should have arisen in this period a place specially set aside for such activity and bearing a new name serves to measure the force of that shift”   <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A new approach to thinking about science was based on a conviction that knowledge is produced as a part of social and cultural practices; therefore, scientific knowledge itself should be understood as a social product.</p>
<p>The perspective of science as a social practice opened up new questions regarding a place in which to construct science <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>, a community of practice <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>, and material instruments and artefacts <sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. It was a move towards unveiling scientific practices and investigating the network of actors that take part in constructing scientific knowledge, i.e., space, material instruments, technology, and community. By the late 1980s, there was no doubt that major changes were coming, driven by research in science and technology studies:  <em>Laboratory Life</em>  by Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1979),  <em>The Manufacture of Knowledge</em>  by Karin Knorr Cetina (1981),  <em>Art and Artifact in Laboratory Science</em>  by Michael Lynch (1985), and  <em>Science in Action</em>  by Latour (1987).</p>
<p>Such a perspective on science entailed establishing new fields to explore the various aspects of the social construction of science. One area refers to a contextual theory of knowledge, assuming that the knowledge is situated in practice, in contrast to conceptual knowledge, which is abstracted from situations <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. This means, to put it slightly differently, that situated knowledge is a part of the activity, context, and culture in which it is constructed and used. Viewed in this way, space for knowledge production began to be one of the key research issues. Place defines the condition of scientific knowledge construction and determines the research mode and perspectives. Under these circumstances, laboratory studies arrived eventually as a new field focused on the investigation of the space used for scientific inquiry <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this light, the emergence of the laboratory in the humanities entails a significant shift from the  <em>text</em>  towards the  <em>place</em>  where it is constructed. The laboratory draws attention to the space in which humanities experiments are conducted, the knowledge is produced, and scholarly communication occurs. Consequently, the humanities are seen as a  <em>practice</em>  and  <em>process</em>  that engages space, interactions, and equipment. Like the natural sciences and techno-science, the humanities involve  “infrastructural thinking”   <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>, according to which the architecture of the humanistic inquiry determines the process of knowledge construction.</p>
<p>The 1980s and 1990s, as Robert E. Kohler observed astutely, were thus recognized as a productive time for laboratory studies, and the laboratory itself was seen as a social institution. After that time, the notion of the laboratory was neglected until interest was revived again in the twenty-first century <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. Kohler’s article  “Lab History”  from 2008 is a significant gesture, implying that there was a surge in lab activity again after 2007 and a need for tracking its history. In this context, it is worth recalling another important publication, namely,  <em>Representation in Scientific Practice. Revisited</em>   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>, a revised book originally published in 1990. The manuscript suggests that research topics come back again after twenty-four years. One key issue it addresses is a return to the idea of laboratory, which, as the editors note,  “extends to other spaces and places via collaborative ventures, shared data centers, and information and communication technologies” , challenging  “the very distinction between laboratory and field”   <sup id="fnref1:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. Both publications draw a connection between the study of scientific laboratories in the 1980s and laboratories of the twenty-first century, which have popped out in the humanities, social sciences, and outside of the university.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-categories-innovation-the-maker-movement-and-community">Cultural Categories: Innovation, the Maker Movement, and Community</h2>
<p>The last line of development of the laboratory turn runs through the prevailing cultural categories of the twenty-first century. Let us now take a look at the following three cultural discourses and their impacts on changes within the university and humanities. The first category of innovation has dominated cultural and social rhetoric and given rise to new concepts, such as the innovation society and innovation paradigm. According to this rhetoric, to tackle the complex social, cultural, and economic problems of the twenty-first century, society must turn into an innovation society, which drives breakthrough solutions and cutting-edge technologies. Such discourse has led to the design of the manifold varieties of innovations labs that have popped up like mushrooms within the university and city space as social institutions; for instance, the Scholarly Innovation Lab (SIL) at the UCLA library and the Digital Innovation Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The innovation concept has begun to be a crucial category defining the humanities labs and signifying the new features found within these labs, including a strong link between the humanities and the creative industries, providing cutting-edge equipment for excellent research, and solving hard problems. As a result of this discourse, the concept of an innovative university emerged with the desire to turn the university into a successful and competitive business or entrepreneurial university <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The innovation approach requires effective creative ideas and thinking outside the box. Creativity is seen as a key method with which to improve social and economic conditions and  “devise potentially better options for the future”   <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. A societal awareness of the value of creativity is constructed by establishing  <em>creative spaces</em>  that integrate the local community around the processes of creative endeavours. One such place is a library creative space that  “focuses wholly or in part on content creation as opposed to content consumption alone”   <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. The process of creation can include drawings and photographs, audio materials, videos, three-dimensional objects, computer coding, web-based multimedia, and more. Hence, library creative spaces play a key role in expanding the function of the library from providing information resources and services to integrating and developing the community through creative activities. One realization of these creative spaces is the advent of a laboratory in the common space that is the library. A laboratory in the library offers space, equipment, and resources and guides learning how to use digital tools and create digital projects <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Another type of creative space is the makerspace defined as a  “center or workspace where like-minded people get together to make things”   <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>. The concept of makerspace is particularly related to a creative and participatory culture. It was conceived of as an outgrowth of the cultural maker movement, created as a  “return to craft” , in which people can build things together again <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. Therefore, coming back to the idea of  <em>making things</em>  came about as a response to consumption and corporate culture, driving interest in hacker and do-it-yourself cultures. Labcraft, using Hendrik Tiesinga and Remko Berkhout’s term <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>, is thus seen as an innovative and, above all, community lab, seeking to connect people, create a space for dialogue, and transfer ideas to the world. Such labs aim to create new solutions and develop new ways of seeing the world. The maker movement has been embodied by the rise of media labs, established as institutionalized units (the academic media labs), cultural events (media lab workshops), and alternative models of education based on tinkering and hacking. Eventually, the do-it-yourself approach made inroads into academic culture through the launch of makerspaces (e.g., Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria) and hackerspaces (e.g., Blow Things Up at the University of Colorado, Boulder) and organizing hackathons (e.g., in the Computational Humanities Lab at the University of Wisconsin–Madison).</p>
<p>The last cultural category, which has accompanied the maker movement, is community. The labcraft, makerspace, and hackathon movements are all based on the idea of the community being the main resource and driving force behind them. The idea of the community, introduced in the 1990s <sup id="fnref1:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>, gained importance again in the twenty-first century, along with the concepts of civic engagement, activism, and the public humanities. Community and public engagement began to be common categories used to describe media and humanities labs. For instance, the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia Library is described as a community lab with the following motto:  “We build up people and practices more than products.”  The lab prioritizes the process of learning and working together:  “ People over projects  means that we care more about such outcomes, than about whether a formal  project  happens”   <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. The Change Making Media Lab at the University of Southern California, in turn, is a good example of public engagement in that it collaborates with people outside of the academy and creates products, such as entertaining dramas, that have real impacts on the local community.</p>
<p>Cultural trends and a circulation of particular concepts are reflected in the emergence of different types of academic institutions, ranging from the entrepreneurial to the engaged university. To meet contemporary challenges, the humanities have made an  “infrastructural turn”   <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup> to build a physical place that, through the architecture itself, brings new features to the field: innovation, experimentation, hands-on practices, and collaboration. Under such circumstances, humanities labs have been constructed.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-laboratory-in-the-humanities">A Brief History of the Laboratory in the Humanities</h2>
<p>The first laboratories serving other than natural sciences were computer science labs established in media studies in the 1980s and 1990s; for instance, the Laboratory Paragraphe at the University of Paris 8 in 1983, Media Lab at MIT in 1985, and Aalto Media Lab at Aalto University in 1993. Media labs were launched as production, dynamic, and experimental research spaces, studios, and ateliers. The goals of the first laboratories were to foster the creation of new media projects which explored the impact of technology on society and the human condition, developed hardware and software within the context of artistic projects, and tested the potential of electronic technologies. Concurrently, in the late 1990s, the word lab was applied to humanities and technology, for example, HUMlab at Umeå University was founded in 1997 and Stanford Humanities Lab at Stanford University in 1999. Although the institutional models for these units were not new, their conceptualization as lab was an original move. Nevertheless, the end of the twentieth century and beginning of the twenty-first century remained under the domination of media labs.</p>
<p>Since 2007, the situation changed significantly through the dissemination of the concept of a laboratory in the humanities domain. The laboratory concept has expanded rapidly across the humanities department (e.g., the Global History Lab in the Department of History at Princeton University, 2007; the Media Archaeology Lab in the Department of English at the University of Colorado, Boulder, 2009) and libraries (e.g., the Scholars’ Lab launched in the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia, 2008). The trend towards building laboratories continued unabated, reaching the point of the laboratory boom after 2010 that converged with the computational turn in the humanities <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>, the development of the digital humanities <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>, and the emergence of virtual laboratory (Alfalab, a project of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, run in 2009-2011). Since 2010, the concept of laboratory has spread over the university campus, made inroads into city space and public cultural institutions <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup> and been launched in places that had never been designated for this purpose.</p>
<p>Along with the humanities labs, with names referring mainly to disciplines and cultural categories (e.g., the Culture Lab at Brown University and Participatory Cultures Lab at McGill University), digital humanities labs have begun to proliferate right next to existing models of centers (e.g., the Digital Humanities Laboratory at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Digital Humanities Lab at Utrecht University, and the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory at Yale University). The proliferation of various labs in the humanities has led to the broadening of the concept of laboratory beyond the notion of a physical place. The term laboratory is used to describe the following places, initiatives, and ideas: an interdisciplinary department (the Humanities Lab at Lund University), a center (the HUMlab at Umeå University), a makerspace (the Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria), an incubator for new ideas (the Humanities Lab at American University), a research workshop (the Northwestern University Digital Humanities Laboratory at Northwestern University), a collaboration of individuals (the Nebraska Literary Lab at the University of Nebraska), a coalition (the Humanities Action Lab led from Rutgers University-Newark), a student-led initiative (the Public Humanities Lab at the University of Virginia), a state-of-the-art facility (the Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Exeter), an innovative course (the Humanities Labs at Colby College), a study programme (the Humanities Lab at Leiden University), consortium (the DigHumLab at Aarhus University), a virtual research environment (the Digital Humanities Innovation Lab at the National University of Distance Education), and even a podcast (the Literature Lab Podcasts at Brandeis University). Consequently, the notion of laboratory has gone far beyond its traditional meaning, turning into a project that can be done or an action that can be taken, then dispersed all over the world. A good example of this approach is the Humanities Action Lab led from Rutgers University-Newark. It is a coalition of universities, organizations, and public spaces in twenty cities that collaborate to build community-curated public humanities projects. The lab can be created everywhere needed to engage a community around a particular challenge.</p>
<p>Thus, over the last years, we have observed the proliferation of humanities labs and the growing interest in a laboratory that implies a new mode of working. It suffices to mention conferences, panel discussions, and seminars devoted to the concept and organization of laboratory:  “Building the Humanities Lab: Scholarly Practices in Virtual Research Environments” , the panel session in the Digital Humanities conference at King’s College London in 2010;  “Theories and Practices of the Literary Lab”  roundtable at Modern Language Association National Meeting in Boston in 2013;  “The Hum Lab: A Consortial Workshop”  at Haverford College in 2014;  “The Humanities Laboratory: Discussions of New Campus Models” , organized by Arizona State University’s Institute for Humanities Research for the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2016;  “Reimagining the Humanities Lab” , a panel discussion at ADHO Digital Humanities Conference in Mexico City in 2018;  “What Is a Feminist Lab?”  symposium at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 2019;  “Humanities Laboratories: Critical Infrastructures and Knowledge Experiments”  workshop at King’s College London in 2019;  “Rebuilding Laboratories”  workshop at the University of Birmingham in 2019; and  “The Architecture of Science and the Humanities”  workshop at Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in 2019. This list shows that there is an urgent need to discuss this institutional model for the humanities and understand its implications for scholarly research and teaching practices.</p>
<h2 id="typology-of-humanities-labs">Typology of Humanities Labs</h2>
<p>To comprehend a laboratory in the humanities and identify its different realization, I firstly collected the descriptions of labs ranging from media labs to digital and non-digital humanities labs <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>, scrutinize the context and meaning of the term laboratory, analyse their mission statements, and further determine their functions. Before discussing the typology in detail, however, we can pose a significant question of what is a humanities lab in itself? To answer this question, let us look at below statements from three laboratories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Humanities + Design our mission is to produce, through the lens of humanistic inquiry, new modes of thinking in design and computer science to serve data-driven research in the humanities. We believe that humanistic inquiry, grounded in interpretation, has much to contribute to the development of technologies if they are to help us reveal ambiguity and paradox, allowing human-scale exploration of complex systems. In the laboratory environment, theoretical and methodological discussions happen side-by-side with hands-on work with digital materials. Humanities scholars and students, designers, engineers, and computer scientists engage together in ongoing tool design as defined by the specific needs of participating humanities projects.<br>

The Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLab), a unit of Yale University Library, offers space, community, and resources for Yale scholars who are using computational methods to pursue research questions in the arts, humanities, and humanistic social sciences. Located inside Sterling Memorial Library, the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory is a hub for consultations, training, and opportunities that support Yale students, faculty, and cultural heritage professionals in their engagement with digital tools and techniques.<br>
<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup><br>
The Humanities Lab at ASU is designed as an experimental space in which interdisciplinary faculty teams work with students from a variety of academic and cultural backgrounds to investigate grand social challenges, to construct researchable questions that delve deeply into those challenges, and to generate possible approaches to complex, “wicked” issues like immigration, health, and climate change, for which there are no easy answers.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>The first lab, the Humanities + Design is a research lab at the Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis at Stanford University focused on designing and producing tools through the lens of humanistic inquiry. Critical thinking practiced by humanities scholars is thus applied to a hands-on work conducted by designers, engineers, and computer scientists. The lab team works on building open source tools for digital research, such as Data Pen, an instrument for creating data sets that draws from linked data sources, and a visualization tool Palladio. The second example represents a lab established as a shared space at the university’s library. It is a facility that provides equipment and digital technologies and support in digital humanities skills acquisition for both research and teaching purposes through consultations, training, and guest lectures. This multifunctional lab has been built to offer space, community, and resources for scholars in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. The last statement, in turn, describes the Humanities Lab at Arizona State University which is a set of lab-based courses. The lab offers an experimental space where students and faculty work on a particular problem in intergenerational collaborative teams for one or two semesters. Each lab is devoted to a specific socio-cultural challenge that is investigated through critical thinking, critical engagement, hands-on practices, and interdisciplinary discussions. Although these three labs represent different functions and practices, each is guided by a laboratory ethos, defined by the Stanford Humanities Lab: collaborative, co-creative, and team-based <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>. These features are the core of laboratory where the humanistic inquiry, knowledge, and practices are applied, produced, tested, and investigated.</p>
<p>This wide range of uses of the term laboratory implies that labs are varied due to the function and activities. Based on the collected data, I indicate the following six functions of laboratories in the humanities:</p>
<p>Research-focused lab - a place for conducting, coordinating, and promoting cross-disciplinary research, ranging from theoretical, critical, and methodological analysis and interpretations to practices based on learning-by-doing approach, such the application of digital tools, experimentation, and prototyping.  Design-focused lab - a place for designing and producing technical tools, applications, website, platforms, and creative works which provide new methods, tools, and a subject of critical research.  Work station-type lab - a place for providing equipment, hardware, software, and resource for facilitating research, teaching, and learning.   Service-focused lab - a place for meeting the individual needs of users through consulting, technological services (web hosting, maintenance, dissemination and preservation for digital projects), and computer services (support for conducting digital projects).  Public engagement-focused lab - a place that conducts research and organizes events related to social challenges and community affairs, creates community-curated and participatory projects, develops new ways of collaborations with public audiences, and promotes civic engagement.   Pedagogical-focused lab - a place for teaching, training, and learning through courses, seminars, lectures, workshops, etc. A laboratory that implies collaborative and experimental practices, entails the dissemination of new forms of teaching and learning in the humanities, including hands-on practices based on the learning-by-doing approach (popularized by creative spaces, makerspaces, and hackerspaces that practice prototyping, tinkering, and hacking; e.g. the Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria and the Computational Humanities Lab at the University of Wisconsin–Madison); experiential learning and offsite research, that is to say, learning through direct experience outside a traditional academic setting, for instance, through traveling (The Global Humanities Lab course in the Alice Kaplan Institute for the Humanities at Northwestern University offers students the investigation of an international humanities through traveling to cities being the subject of the study) or field trips (e.g. the Encountering Food course of the Humanities and Arts Labs at Albion College where students explore local and global food through a series of projects and field trips and organize a community dinner); problem-based learning meaning that students investigate an open-ended problem through collaborative and interdisciplinary practices (e.g. the Humanities Lab at Arizona State University); and community-curated public humanities projects (e.g. practiced by the Humanities Action Lab, a coalition of universities, organizations, and public spaces in forty cities, led from Rutgers University-Newark).</p>
<p>Since any laboratory is a self-defined entity focused on a specific function, activity, and practice, it can be difficult to build a common definition of the laboratory in the humanities. However, based on the above reflections, I attempt to create the following working definition of the humanities lab:</p>
<p><em>A laboratory in the humanities is a technical, research, and intellectual infrastructure for humanistic issues and inquiries which offers space (physical, virtual or conceptual), community, and resources to conduct a set of activities resulting from its specific function (e.g. research, design, work station, service, pedagogical, and public engagement). Laboratory initiatives are guided by the following principles: interdisciplinarity, collaboration, co-creation, team-based, and experimentation.</em></p>
<p>The widespread application of the term laboratory has led to the fact that there is no single model for the humanities laboratory. Based on more than two hundred laboratories, established in North America, North-Western Europe, and Australia, I determine five models for the humanities labs due to their situatedness (physical or virtual), traditions, functions, scholarly questions, practices, and activities. Let us now explore these five models (the center-type lab, the techno-science lab, the work station-type lab, the social challenges-centric lab, and virtual lab), investigate their organization and indicate a discourse from which they originate.</p>
<h2 id="the-center-type-labs">The center-type labs</h2>
<p>To characterize the center model-based laboratories, it is essential to summarize the infrastructure changes that occurred in the humanities over the past years. In the 1990s, as previously stated, the first laboratories emerged in the humanities (e.g. the English Media Lab at the Department of English of the University of Manitoba in 1995 and the HUMlab at Umeå University in 1997) modelled upon media labs for providing digital and analog media, facilitating the use of digital and online resources, and assisting with the application of digital tools for the study of literature, language, culture, and history. Since the 1990s, the digital humanities have been rapidly developing through establishing the first humanities computing centers, later becoming the digital humanities centers, defined by Zorich as  “an entity where new media and technologies are used for humanities-based research, teaching, and intellectual engagement and experimentation”   <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. The center played a crucial role in facilitating and reinforcing digital humanities research at the university by providing digital resources, services, and tools, supporting the teaching of new digital practices, and hosting symposia and lectures (e.g., the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at King’s College London established in 1991 and Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities in 1999). Along with the proliferation of the digital humanities centers, a new institutional unit emerged in the humanities — a laboratory — modelled on a center for advancing and fostering the humanities research on and with digital technologies (e.g., the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab at the University of Victoria founded in 2005 and Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia in 2006).</p>
<p>The next changes involve the reorganization of digital humanities centers into departments (e.g., the Centre for Computing in the Humanities was renamed the King’s College Department of Digital Humanities) and thereby, the institutionalization of the discipline and the establishment of digital humanities programmes and degrees. Later, the infrastructure of the center would be a strategic choice for the university to further set up the department of digital humanities (e.g. the Department of Digital Humanities at the University of Helsinki grew out of the Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities, research network, and infrastructure established in 2016). Meantime, laboratories have been launched in the humanities departments and libraries, emulating the center model or establishing an entirely new infrastructure for the humanities research, teaching, and activities.</p>
<p>Laboratories built upon the center model are a central institution at the university for conducting, coordinating, and promoting research, teaching, and infrastructure for digitization in the humanities and social science. They play a key role in building collaboration across departments and providing support and training to the entire university, as exemplified by the Price Lab for Digital Humanities at the University of Pennsylvania:  “The Price Lab serves as a central node of communication and exchange across Penn’s many departments, centers, and schools with expertise and interest in the digital humanities”   <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Instances of laboratories that were influenced by the center model in other institutions include: the HUMlab at Umeå University (1997); the Humanities Lab at Lund University (2005); Electronic Textual Cultures Lab at the University of Victoria (2005); the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia (2006); the Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Basel (2010); the Carolina Digital Humanities: Digital Innovation Lab at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2011); the UC Arts Digital Lab at the University of Canterbury (2011); the D-Lab at the University of California, Berkeley (2013); the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks at Northeastern University (2013); the Digital Humanities Lab at Utrecht University (2014); the Digital Humanities Innovation Lab (LINHD) at the National University of Distance Education (2014); the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory at Yale University (2015); and the Price Lab for Digital Humanities at the University of Pennsylvania (2015),</p>
<p>The center-type lab model is identified by the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical situatedness – the lab is mainly located in humanities departments or in libraries;</li>
<li>Manifold functions – the lab carries out various functions from conducting and coordinating cross-disciplinary research to providing space, equipment, and resources to facilitating research, teaching, and learning;</li>
<li>Facilities and equipment – the lab offers space, resources, and equipment for conducting and facilitating research projects;</li>
<li>A wide range of research projects – the lab involves research groups and projects devoted to the broad scope of humanities study;</li>
<li>Academic appointments and staffing – the lab affiliates faculty and researchers as well as its own staff;</li>
<li>The community – the goal of the lab is to bring together faculty, staff, and students as well as independent scholars and participants from cultural institutions and industry interested in a particular discipline, practices, and methods through series of open lectures, workshops, and seminars;</li>
<li>Education – the lab offers teaching and training in the form of workshops, courses, academic degree programs, postgraduate and faculty training, fellowships, internships, and summer schools;</li>
<li>Service – the lab offers a number of services to support faculties, staff, and students: consulting, providing technology solutions, maintaining and preserving digital projects, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>While any one of these features might be present in other models, the center is clearly distinguished by a large-scale central role in advancing humanities scholarship as well as supporting the study and the uses of digital methods and technologies for research and teaching in the humanities.</p>
<h2 id="the-techno-science-labs">The techno-science labs</h2>
<p>In the natural sciences a laboratory is an ordinary place which provides facilities, instruments, and equipment with which to conduct experiments, test hypotheses, and investigate samples. Science laboratories have a long history dating back to the alchemical laboratory in the sixteenth century; however, for the purposes of this paper, we will focus on the techno-science model developed in the second half of the twentieth century, along with the acceleration of technological innovation. A crucial moment in a lab history occurred when the laboratory was exposed as a space for constructing knowledge through the use of technology and instruments rather than a place for revealing reality. Sociology of scientific knowledge, mentioned in the previous section, played a key role in this movement. Techno-science implies that science cannot be detached from the technological tools that shape our perceptions and help to produce the knowledge; thus, our observations are always embodied via the practical use of instruments.</p>
<p>Techno-science labs associated with the categories of production, technology, innovation, and experimentation became an inspirational architecture for the humanities in need of a new place to explore the emerging innovative uses of technology in the study of history, art, and culture. Therefore, the impulse to establish a laboratory in the humanities came about in order to replicate the knowledge production environment associated with science. A science-based lab is thus seen as a driving force for cutting-edge projects and a natural space for developing and applying technologies to humanities research. The following labs are good representations of the techno-science lab model in the humanities: the Stanford Humanities Lab at Stanford University (1999-2009); the Critical Media Lab at the University of Waterloo (2008); the CulturePlex Lab at the University of Western Ontario (2010); the Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition Lab at Michigan State University (2012); the Humanities + Design a Research Lab at Stanford University (2012); the Maker Lab in the Humanities at the University of Victoria (2012); the Poetic Media Lab at Stanford University (2013); and the King’s Digital Lab at King’s College London (2015).</p>
<p>Based on these examples, laboratories built using the techno-science model are driven by the following functions: providing state-of-the-art facilities and equipment for experimental and innovative research; promoting new ways of conducting research, teaching, and learning through the application of digital technologies; introducing new digital methods and new modes of knowledge (e.g., data mining, mapping, data visualization, simulation, 3D digitisation, tinkering, coding, prototyping, and fabricating); producing data-driven research in the humanities; designing applications, tools, and platforms used in digital humanities research and teaching; and designing technical infrastructure for the humanities.</p>
<p>The principles that guide the techno-science-based laboratory are identified as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical situatedness – the lab is located in a particular place, in different departments (e.g. the Critical Media Lab is housed in the Institute of Experimental Design and Media Cultures, while the Digital Humanities and Literary Cognition Lab at the Department of English), and shared by people coming from various disciplines who work together on research projects;</li>
<li>Equipment and technology – the lab is equipped with technological devices and tools that are necessary for conducting experiments and innovative projects; for example, hardware, software, applications, platforms, 3D digital technologies, eye-tracking systems, and so forth;</li>
<li>Interdisciplinarity – strong post-disciplinary modes of research carrying out by humanities scholars, designers, computer scientists, software analysts, and engineers;</li>
<li>Experimental research – conducting a technology-based project that attempts to explore new methods of creativity, fill research gaps, and open new scholarly perspectives;</li>
<li>Manual work – doing hands-on work with the use of material devices, instruments, and technologies;</li>
<li>Collaboration – projects are done via collaborative actions between faculty, staff, and students, between different disciplines and departments, and between the university, industry and the public sphere;</li>
<li>Applied research – designing applications, tools, digital methods, and resources to meet the specific needs of humanities projects (e.g., Breve and Palladio, which are open-source tools for research designed by Humanities + Design a Research Lab);</li>
<li>Products – the lab work is focused on designing measurable, applicable, and practical products, for instance, the Lacuna tool, produced by the Poetic Media Lab at Stanford University, is used in the Rhizomatic Reading project developed at the Center for Digital Humanities in the Princeton University Library to analyse connections across literary texts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The humanities labs originated from techno-science labs are focused on production, tools, and research products. Although they stress the notions of community and collectivity, these concepts are not their goals in and of themselves but rather a way to achieve their objectives. Each lab represents distinct aspects and missions, but their common and the most significant feature is technology  “being the glue” , to use Pierre Proske’ description of the Media Lab Melbourne <sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. Digital technology, tools, and platforms are at once the methods, the research, and the objects of study themselves. Drawing on the description of Stanford Humanities Lab, we can summarize that these labs involves a  “triangulation of arts practice, commentary/critique, and outreach, merging research, pedagogy, publication and practice. They didn’t just comment and discuss, they built: new media, interactive archives, predictive models of social change, new courses, collaborative research workshops, art exhibitions”   <sup id="fnref1:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="the-work-station-type-lab">The work station-type lab</h2>
<p>The next model is called both the work station and service model <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>, referring to the idea of desktop classrooms, a computer lab, and instructional technology spaces. This type of laboratory operates as a physical room that accumulates equipment and devices used to support faculty and students in their work. It functions as the work space that supplies facilities, such as editing software, digital cameras, and audio recording devices; provides services, such as printing and studio spaces; and supports the use of software and devices. Labs based on the work station model are located mainly in libraries, which play a key role in facilitating humanities research by providing resources and equipment. The library is also seen as a major place for digital humanities since it typically carries out the following tasks: digitizing materials, building digital collections and resources, and supporting research data management. Examples of the works station-type laboratories include: the Digital Scholarship Lab at Brown University (2012); the Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (2012); the Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (2013); the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Oklahoma (2014); Willson Center Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Georgia (2015); the Digital Humanities Lab at Bowling Green State University (2015); the Digital Humanities Lab at Rutgers University (2015); the Humanities Research Lab at California State University, Northridge (2016); the Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Exeter (2017); the Digital Humanities Lab in the Centre for Digital Humanities Research at Australian National University (2017); and the Digital Scholarship Lab at Michigan State University (2018).</p>
<p>These labs are guided by the following functions: supplying facilities, equipment, and devices; supporting faculty and students in their studies; providing help in research data management; and training faculty and students in regard to the utilization of equipment, digital tools, and software.</p>
<p>The work station model is distinguished by features listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical situatedness – the lab is located mainly in libraries but also in the humanities departments;</li>
<li>Reconfigurable space – the place is made to be adjusted according to needs and conditions; for example, the Digital Scholarship Lab at the Brown University Library can be converted from a lecture hall to a team project room;</li>
<li>Facilities, equipment, and technological tools – the lab provides different types of facilities (sound recording studio, interview room), equipment (computers, cameras, eye trackers, 3D printers), and software;</li>
<li>Specific function – the lab defines its purposes clearly, which may range from providing equipment and tools for students, supporting research data management, offering technical assistance, such as metadata encoding and archiving digital projects, and training faculty and students on the use of various media and tools;</li>
<li>Specific users – the lab targets specific users who have access to the lab and permission to use its facilities; for instance, the Digital Humanities Lab at Rutgers University is available only to members of the Rutgers digital humanities community;</li>
<li>Terms and conditions – since the lab welcomes everyone from any discipline and level of experience, it provides rules related to the use of the lab’s facilities and equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The humanities lab as a work station aims to provide an environment, services, and facilities which support scholarly work rather than innovative research projects, as in the case of techno-science labs. A laboratory is thus understood literally as a place — referring again to Hannaway’s definition — equipped with specialized instruments and apparatuses that require hands-on skills and knowledge for their utilization.</p>
<h2 id="the-social-challenges-centric-lab">The social challenges-centric lab</h2>
<p>The next model of a humanities laboratory grows out of social labs, community labs, and citizen labs <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> as well as public humanities initiatives. It comes from seeking  “new research methods, new lines of inquiry, and new ways of engaging with public audiences”   <sup id="fnref1:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> for tackling real-world problems and stimulating social changes. Marlieke Kieboom claims that one way to address global and local problems is to establish a new space entailing new practices, methods, and solutions; a promising place for undertaking the challenges is a laboratory seen as a  “container for social experimentation”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. A lab implies new practices, such as collaboration, integration, public action, and dialogue across departments, institutions, and communities. A laboratory is an experimental space where the humanities can merge with other disciplines and take part in the process of addressing local and global concerns. The great example of this model is the Humanities Lab at Arizona State University founded by Sally Kitch in 2017 to enhance problem-based study and interdisciplinary and intergenerational collaboration. As Kitch said,  “I started the Humanities Lab because I realized that our students were not benefitting from the kind of interdisciplinary, exploratory experiences faculty were getting through the IHR. (…) So I wanted to see if we could establish a way for students to get that experience; to recognize the humanities as important for approaching and addressing today’s challenges, because the kinds of questions that really plague us are humanistic at their core. They’re about values and culture and understanding the way people form beliefs and the kinds of attitudes we carry around with us and the way we all live in our own narratives. And encountering that is essential for solving these problems.”   <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup> The Humanities Lab was created as an experimental space for investigating wicked problems, such as immigration, health, and climate change through the humanities inquiry approach and intervention:  “Most of the really big challenges we face are not fundamentally about technology, science, economics, etc. They are human challenges that have been with us for a very long time and therefore require human-centred inquiry as part of the search for a solution. Yet, often the humanities disciplines are not included in such discussions. Therefore, the Humanities Lab brings the humanities to the table by emphasizing the study of values and the way we understand the world around us. Merging the humanities with diverse disciplines helps us to see the grand social challenges more holistically and therefore puts us in a better position to conceptualize solutions.”   <sup id="fnref1:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike the techno-science model, which is centred on designing and applying technological tools to research projects, the social challenges-centric model aims to build a common and interventive space that in itself is a way to address the most profound social issues. I indicate three varieties of the social challenges-centric model for a humanities lab: coalition-based lab, problem-based lab, and community engagement lab. This model is thus not a unified structure, but a dynamic form driven by the ideas of community, dialogue, and intervention.</p>
<p>The first type of lab arises as an initiative of a coalition of various institutions that activate a laboratory as an urgent need to react to pressing problems in a particular place. The Humanities Action Lab (HAL) is a coalition of universities, issue organizations, and public spaces in forty cities led from Rutgers University-Newark. Students and stakeholders in each city investigate a particular problem in a local context, produce community-curated public humanities projects, and stimulate public dialogue on the urgent questions. Laboratories can also work on the same problem explored then by different communities and from various perspectives. They develop local contributions to national project that further  “travel nationally and internationally to museums, public libraries, cultural centers, and other spaces in each of the communities that helped create them”   <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>. The examples of national projects are  “Guantánamo Public Memory Project”  hosted by Columbia University. This initiative involved over 300 students from 13 universities to research, document, and interpret the history of the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.  “Students from around the country collaborated with more than 600 community stakeholders including Haitian refugees, former service people, and attorneys representing current detainees, to explore GTMO’s history from many perspectives, as well as the questions it raises today. Together they created a traveling exhibit, web platform, digital and physical archive, interview collection, and series of public dialogues. The exhibit has traveled for more than 3 years to 18 cities and counting, with public dialogues in each place. More than 500,000 people will have had a face-to-face encounter with the exhibit, and many more online and through social media”   <sup id="fnref1:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>. This type of laboratory is a great example of how the humanities can bring together people from various institutions around a particular challenge, participate in public dialogue and call for action at the local and national level.</p>
<p>The problem-based lab is in turn set up around a central theme for a specific purpose. It thus creates an environment — problem space — around particular urgent social and cultural issues that need to be addressed by integrative and interdisciplinary approach. Good examples are the labs within the Humanities Laboratories at the Franklin Humanities Institute of Duke University, where each individual lab is devoted to a particular problem and launched for mainly three years. The first lab at the FHI, Haiti Lab, was established after Haiti’s natural disaster in 2010 to broaden knowledge about Haitian culture, history, and language and expand Haitian studies in the U.S. Other labs at the FHI devoted to significant social phenomena and challenges are BorderWork(s) Lab (2011-2014) investigating the acts of division and demarcation in the world; Health Humanities Lab (2016- present) undertaking issues of clinical medicine and public health from the perspective of the humanities and social science; and From Slavery to Freedom Lab (2018- present) examining the life and afterlives of slavery and emancipation. The similar type of problem-based lab is also set up within the Humanities Lab at Arizona State University where each lab works as a one- or two-semester course bringing together students and faculty around wicked issues. The lab is thus established for a fixed period of time to investigate grand social challenges, construct researchable questions, and generate possible approaches to complex problems. So far, the Humanities Lab program has launched the following courses: Health &amp; Wellbeing Lab, Sexual Violence Lab, Sustaining Humans Lab, Rebuilding Puerto Rico Lab, and Facing Immigration Lab. The next great example, differing from the previous ones, is the Human Security Collaboratory (HS Collab) launched by the Global Security Initiative (GSI) at Arizona State University focused on addressing complex problems related to digital security and civil rights through the application of digital humanities tools and inquiries. The lab’s current projects include  “Border Quants” , a collective of artists and scholars conducting research related to digital human rights, personal data protection, and decolonial approaches to data use, and  “Vibrant Lives” , an immersive performance installation as a critical comment on the use and monetization of personal data production. The important part of the lab’s activities is a public engagement through events, such as a series of lunchtime conversations about digital human security issues.</p>
<p>The third type of lab — the community engagement lab — aims to promote civic engagement through participatory approaches to research and social action. Good examples are the mentioned HS Collab at Arizona State University and the Engage Media Lab at The New School. The latter lab is a student group and research lab that develops workshops, screenings, and research projects in collaboration with The New School students and the New York City community. Other instances include the Public Humanities Lab at the University of Virginia and the Participatory Cultures Lab at McGill University. The last one is particularly focused on participatory research devoted to issues of social justice, gender-based violence, food security, and poverty alleviation. Research projects use various tools that engage a community: digital storytelling, photovoice, participatory archiving, and more. Community engagement projects are conducted through the collaboration with variety countries including South Africa, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>To summarize, instances of laboratories built upon the social challenges-centric model include: the Humanities Laboratories at Duke University (2010); the Participatory Cultures Lab at McGill University (2010); the Engage Media Lab at The New School (2011); the Humanities Action Lab led from Rutgers University-Newark (2014); the Human Security Collaboratory (HS Collab) at Arizona State University (2015); the Humanities Lab at Arizona State University (2017); and the Public Humanities Lab at the University of Virginia (2017).</p>
<p>Based on these cases, the social challenges-centric model of labs can encompass the following functions: building a community around the lab and challenges; fostering collaboration and communication across departments, institutions, and communities; engaging with the local community beyond the university; connecting the diverse local perspectives of communities around the world; producing community-curated public humanities projects; propelling positive social, cultural, and environmental changes; promoting civic engagement; and initiating new public dialogues.</p>
<p>The model is guided by the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible structure – the lab can be situated physically or virtually and formed as a meeting place, research group or course; in this sense, a lab can be created anywhere at the university or beyond;</li>
<li>Flexible duration – the lab can be set up for a specific period of time and then can be closed down once a project is concluded and goals are achieved;</li>
<li>The community – people gathered around the lab are the main resources and their dialogue are the driving forces of the lab;</li>
<li>Collaboration and integration – the lab is an integrative environment for faculty, staff, students, and the local community;</li>
<li>Specific purpose of the lab – the goals are particularly related to social challenges, global “wicked” problems, and the local community;</li>
<li>The infrastructure of engagement – the lab works as the infrastructure that provides space and tools for intervening in social issues, translating ideas into action, and enhancing the engaged humanities;</li>
<li>A wide range of methods – the lab uses various methods for tackling problems, such as public dialogues, interventions, digital methods, interviews, testimonies, prototyping, and participatory-based methods;</li>
<li>Public actions – public initiatives are a product of the lab, including exhibits, web platforms, digital and physical archives, interview collections, and series of public dialogues.</li>
</ul>
<p>The social challenges-centric model for the humanities lab originates from the concepts of social labs, citizen labs, and public creative spaces. While the techno-science model is centred on applied research, technological issues, and innovative approaches, the social challenges-centric model is created around people, social issues, and public engagement. Further, while the techno-science model produces quantifiable and applied projects, the products of this model of labs are dynamic, powerful, and influential. As Zaid Hassan claims,  “Complex challenges are therefore dynamic and can change in unexpected ways over time, whereas technical challenges are relatively stable and static in comparison”   <sup id="fnref1:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>. To conclude, the social challenges-centric model can be created in any environment where there is a need to initiate dialogue and collaboration across communities to solve particular local problems.</p>
<h2 id="the-virtual-lab">The virtual lab</h2>
<p>Thus far, the term laboratory has been used in the context of Hannaway’s definition of a place which accumulates instruments, techniques, and apparatuses. The techno-science, work station, and community labs have one major thing in common, which is physical situatedness <sup id="fnref2:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. A concrete location with an infrastructure and facilities determines the knowledge creation practices, the collaboration methods, and social interactions. However, in recent years, along with the development of cyberinfrastructure, we have witnessed the expansion of a new lab model: the virtual laboratory.</p>
<p>The advancement of cyberinfrastructure underpinned the development of the digital humanities field that applies computational tools and methods to the humanities. The discipline of digital humanities is based on the utilization of digital source materials, digital methods, and new ways of collaborating in the digital environment. The core feature of the digital humanities is thus virtual situatedness, defined as the digital, internet-based workspace with an infrastructure, connection, and operation that affect the work and research communication. Scholars work in the virtual space, including online platforms and the virtual research environment, which directs digital humanities research, supports the use of digital tools, and enables scholarly collaboration. Digital humanities scholars are thus examples of researchers who work in both physical and virtual spaces. Therefore, their research rooms comprise physical places, such as a laboratory or center, as well as a virtual laboratory. Hence, the concept of laboratory goes beyond the category of physical location towards a placeless and virtual idea not determined by walls and physical situatedness. The virtual model of the humanities lab plays a key role in the cyberinfrastructure that enhances the web-based research environment, supports national and international collaborations, facilitates networks of scholars, and provides data services, resources, and tools.</p>
<p>Given the scope of the function and the operation of the virtual laboratory, the model comprises two types of labs. The first is formed as a collaborative platform for enhancing communication and cooperation and promoting new modes of learning and research with the use of digital tools and technologies. HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory) constitutes a good example of this initiative. It is a community-based publishing and an academic social networking platform that enables global communication, sharing, and collaborations among students and researchers across the humanities, social sciences, media studies, the arts, and technology sectors. Alfalab (2009-2011), in turn, was a collaborative network and a virtual project of five institutes of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences that aimed to promote, provide, and apply the use of digital tools and methods in the humanities research practices and foster a cooperation of humanities researchers at national and international levels.</p>
<p>The second type, called the virtual research environment, is a virtual space for facilitating digital research processes, providing databases, tools, and services, and promoting collaboration across the university, academic institutions, and cultural organizations. It is an innovative, web-based, and community-oriented digital environment with an international dimension, defined by Annamaria Carusi and Torsten Reimer as a  “set of web applications, online tools, systems and processes interoperating to facilitate or enhance the research process within and without institutional boundaries; it enables collaborative research activities beyond geographical barriers”   <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>. Examples of virtual research environments for the humanities are the TextGrid Laboratory provided by DARIAH-DE; DHVLab, the Digital Humanities Virtual Laboratory carried out at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (it consists of a teaching and research infrastructure in the applications and methods used in the digital humanities); HuNI (Humanities Networked Infrastructure), a virtual laboratory developed as part of the Australian government’s NeCTAR (National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Resources) program (it is a platform that combines data from many Australian cultural websites into the humanities and creative arts database); the Digital Humanities Innovation Lab (LINHD) at the National University of Distance Education in Spain (a laboratory that serves as a hub for infrastructures and tools for digital humanities projects in Spain and Spanish speaking countries); and the Nordic Digital Humanities Laboratory (NDHL), the ongoing initiative that aims to create convergence in Nordic humanities and arts e-infrastructures through a participant-driven virtual laboratory for data-intensive research.</p>
<p>Hence, the structure of the virtual model of the humanities laboratory can be grasped through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual situatedness – research and collaboration processes take place in the digital and shared workspace;</li>
<li>Technology and software – they are key composers of virtual spaces and the main conditions for sustaining, accessing, and using the virtual laboratory;</li>
<li>Users-driven – the virtual lab is created for and by the research community; thus, the development of the virtual lab depends on users’ activities, support, and feedback;</li>
<li>Network approach – the main purpose of the lab is building the interaction and collaboration network between researchers, universities, and organizations;</li>
<li>Service and resource-based project – the virtual lab provides data services, digital materials, tools, and an environment for research practices and collaboration;</li>
<li>Terms and conditions – the lab space is determined by the terms and conditions related to access, using, and sharing the data and other resources within the virtual platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advancement of cyberinfrastructure ushered in the era of virtual laboratories, created in the digital environment beyond physical, geographical, and cultural borders. Similar to the center-type lab, the techno-science and work station-type lab, the virtual laboratory facilitates scholarly practices and enables collaborative, innovative, and technology-based projects. Hence, the virtual lab represents a laboratory with the aspects characterized by the rest of the models. The main difference lies in situatedness; while the previous labs are all determined by a physical location and physical infrastructure, digital labs are signified by virtual milieu and software.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The paper has shown that the laboratory turn has emerged in the humanities as a part of a wider process of the laboratorization of social life, which has been occurring since the 1980s and with a significant intensification in the last ten years. The emergence of the laboratory in the humanities is thus the effect of superimposing three discourses that appeared in different domains: in the humanities, social sciences, and culture. Laboratories made inroads into the humanities, introduced new methods and practices and put the humanities on a par with applied science. A laboratory, however, is more than a new infrastructure within the humanities, it is a  “meeting place”   <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>, an  “incubator for new ideas”   <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>, and a  “conceptual vehicle”   <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>. The lab becomes conceptualized as a way of thinking entailing new social practices and new research modes (collaboration, experimentation, and hands-on practices). Hence, the laboratory turn has been driven by the movement away from building physical labs towards creating concept-based laboratories (lab courses, lab projects). The study has shown that the year of 2010 became a significant period in the history of the laboratory in the humanities. The Franklin Humanities Institute at Duke University established a new model for the humanities labs, which gave rise to conceptual laboratories seen more as problem-based projects rather than physical work spaces. This essay has focused on the application of the term laboratory to the humanities field in the academy. Therefore, the issues of the implementation of labs beyond this field and the university’s campus remain still unexplored, including the emergence of labs in GLAM sector, the formation of cultural and citizens labs along with makerspaces and hackerspaces in public domain, and the use of the word lab in different areas of social life. Humanities labs constitute part of the ongoing move towards turning various social spaces and initiatives into a laboratory that is a good lever to intervene in local and global complex problems, testing and scaling ideas, and designing prototypes through a collaboration of experts and citizens.</p>
<p>The second major finding was that the implementation of laboratory emerged as the essential process in the development of the humanities, one, which required the reconstruction of infrastructure to support new research practices and methods related to the utilization of technology and digital tools. Therefore, the digital humanities have become the driving force behind building a laboratory space, which supports situated practices, the collaborative, and technology-based projects. Furthermore, the digital humanities have propelled the development of the virtual laboratory, which involves virtual situatedness, a collaborative and academic network, and the digital research environment.</p>
<p>The next significant finding to emerge from this study is that borrowing the laboratory concept from science does not mean imitating its form and features. The humanities have developed unique models of labs differing in the scale of operation, infrastructure, and functions: the center-type lab, the techno-science lab, the work station-type lab, the social challenges-centric lab, and virtual lab. The previous section has shown that each type produces knowledge resulting from a lab structure and mission. Humanities labs do not represent a unified structure; instead, they consist of a group of various types of labs, which have their own architectures, goals, and practices. As a result, the humanities lab does not simply imitate the science lab but adapts this new infrastructure for its own purposes and needs. What fascinates me here is also the way how the humanities reposition themselves in the academy and public domain by bringing the field into dialogue with the sciences in interdisciplinary labs, building their own infrastructure, and designing a lab as a site of intervention in social challenges.</p>
<p>This study has important implications for understanding the concept of laboratory in the humanities as well as developing new models and sites. However, one challenge of the humanities lab remains to be discussed: its sustainability. The problem of sustainability concerns any model of laboratory <sup id="fnref1:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>. It is a question of maintaining the long-term viability of a lab and sustaining the commitments of time and effort made by the people who are the core of the laboratory. Through examining lab projects that completed their activities (e.g., Alfalab, 2009-2011; the Computational Humanities Lab at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, 2012-2014; the Digital Cultures Lab at Douglas College, 2014-2018), it becomes clear that it is a major concern requiring further investigation. The Digital Matters Lab at the University of Utah has taken action in that direction and chosen the topic of sustainability for its activities and projects through 2022. It aims to address the questions of the accessibility of digital materials and the sustainability of in-progress artefacts <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>. Thus, the humanities lab is a fascinating phenomenon in the history of the humanities and many issues regarding its infrastructure, action, and impact require further analysis and reflection.</p>

<p>In the era of web-enabled research, an enormous scholarly infrastructure of apps, software, and research portals structures how many scholars go about their research. This scholarly infrastructure comprises a significant portion of the sites (as this issue of  <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em>  put it) that structure the modern meetings of minds. The design choices of that infrastructure have direct consequences on research.</p>
<p>The developer’s choices, vision, and values shape the experience of knowledge, the movement of ideas, and the room for critical reflection on the interpretations offered by any scholar. Choices made in developing infrastructure govern how easy it is for students to adapt or build on the work of their professors, for scholars to make new discoveries about the same corpus, or members of the public to make new discoveries in an entirely new corpus.</p>
<p>A world of interactive applications facilitating distant reading of texts already exists and many of these applications are organized in a way that allows a researcher to toggle endpoint options on and off, but choices upstream in the application development process are less available. Whether a piece of humanities infrastructure is pipeline-like plays a role in how far the results of one study can be extrapolated to another arena, for instance, how much effort is required to switch the British parliamentary debates out with the Swedish parliamentary debates, given the same infrastructure. This is not to say that pipelines are a panacea to interoperability challenges in digital humanities — many algorithms are specific to language or corpora. While pipelines allow scholars to apply methods to new data sets with little coding effort, the interpretation of results is a human task that still requires rigor.</p>
<p>This article imports a concept (the pipeline) that has a specific meaning and use in the field of computer science. The pipeline becomes, in our argument, a metric for the kinds of online sites that digital humanists have built, which allows us to ask important questions about how our infrastructure facilitates transparency, exchange, and critical inspection of the results of research. Modularity, interoperability, and transparency are values in pipeline development and guide how we develop applications.</p>
<p>We argue that the pinnacle of pipeline-building is when insights developed in one sphere can percolate to other spheres of knowledge with minimum translation — and that how we develop and code our scholarly infrastructure directly determines the options for collaboration, extrapolation, and interdisciplinary insight. We then present a case study of a web application that exemplifies some of the values inherent to a pipeline-based architecture. In a completely modular way, the application, called  “Hansard Topic Relevance Identifier (<a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a>)” , ingests the Hansard data set and presents the results of topic modeling and downstream analysis.</p>
<p>Hansard is an archived and digitized resource of British Parliamentary speech going back to 1803. It contains full transcriptions of all spoken words as well as speaker and debate metadata. It is made up of hundreds of millions of words and the digitization has very few errors. As such, it is a well-studied and valuable resource for historical and socio-political research.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2003, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has become a popular algorithm used to analyze large text corpora in Digital Humanities and beyond <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. LDA is a particular flavor of topic models, which more broadly are probabilistic models for discovering the abstract concepts that occur in a large body of documents. The text is represented hierarchically, where a corpus is a collection of documents and in turn, a document is a collection of words. Topics are distributions over a fixed vocabulary of words and documents are made up of a mixture of topics. For example, an article in a newspaper could be about biology, neuroscience, computational techniques, and biochemistry and another article could be about politics, corruption, and finance. There might be other articles about the biological topic and more articles still about the political topic. The goal of topic modeling is to figure out what a large corpus is about and the results can be used for other text analysis tasks, like honing in on just the biological articles or tracing the prevalence of the political topic over time (given the corpus contains dates).</p>
<h2 id="the-pipeline-concept">The Pipeline Concept</h2>
<p>The concept of the pipeline is already prevalent in the literature of computer science, where pipelines organize suites of algorithms <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. In code, a pipeline describes a series of algorithms that handle repeated processes — for example, data cleaning, stemming, topic modeling — in a series, handling completion of the previous task before moving on to the subsequent task. The omnipresence of pipelines in coding today is a relatively recent feature of the conditions of the available computational power over the last two decades, when pipelines, originally having been developed for use in supercomputers, came to be a feature of all high-power processes.</p>
<p>The use of the term pipeline implied a series of steps, one leading on from the next, describing a purpose-built architecture for complex tasks, originally imagined after Henry Ford&rsquo;s assembly line <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. For our purposes, the assembly line metaphor brings along with it the imagery of interchangeable parts: that is, the ideal pipeline describes a process, and a product, where most of the parts can be swapped in and out, allowing for rapid fixes, upgrading, and comparison. When a pipeline is modular and open-source, if users disagree with our particular choices of algorithms, they can try other ones and assess how the change in algorithm affects the analysis.</p>
<p>These qualities mark out a set of modern values appropriate to scholarly practice in a digital age, and they characterize coding practice around pipelines as a whole. The pipeline makes the process of going from raw text to topic modeling results modular, subject to dissent, and interchangeable with different corpora. It is worth looking at the three values in greater depth.</p>
<ul>
<li>By modular, we mean that an open-source pipeline insures that scholars can, at all steps in the pipeline not just the endpoint, swap out choices or settings for other ones. Modularity enables scholars to explore various results and arrive at richer, more rigorous results. It also makes it possible to do this at little cost to the researcher, in terms of time and resources needed to make and test the changes.</li>
<li>By subject to dissent, we mean that scholars may take issue with any individual choice made in the construction of the pipeline. In order to intellectually engage the implications of their disagreement on the research process, scholars must be able to recreate alternative results that would have happened had one of the algorithms in the pipeline been switched out — for instance, had a different choice of stemmer or topic modeling algorithm been employed. In this process of openness to dissent, the pipeline becomes a tool for exploring best practices in digital research, where scholarly disagreements about tools and interpretation can be pinpointed for discussion and turned into instructive examples.</li>
<li>By interchangeable, we mean that once an open-source pipeline is deemed useful for humanities and social science knowledge, other scholars may want to apply the insights from a research process to other bodies of text. Where no scholarly process exists for packaging tools into a pipeline, other scholars inspired by a research process must recreate the process from scratch. Where research is packaged as a pipeline, however, switching a few lines of code makes it possible for the scholar to apply one pipeline from the British Hansard debates to the Canadian or Australian Parliamentary debates, or any other text corpora. Interchangeability is a scholarly value because it enables the extension of insights from one domain of humanities or social science research into another domain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="previous-waves-of-critical-thinking-about-humanities-infrastructure">Previous Waves of Critical Thinking about Humanities Infrastructure</h2>
<p>A previous wave of efforts to bring structure to digital humanities research has foregrounded humanities infrastructure as a site of making. This literature has dealt with both the physical and organizational infrastructure of research <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and data infrastructures <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Brooke’s GutenTag, for example, is a software that samples sub-corpora from the Gutenberg corpus based on publication dates, gender of the author, etc., and adds user-selected tags to the selection. Some, but not all of this research has suggested a formal set of values for analysis. Mattern argues that whether infrastructure is hard (roads, railways, bridges, data centers, fiber-optic cables, e-waste handlers, etc.) or soft (measurement standards, technical protocols, naming conventions, etc.), digital humanists among other interfacers with infrastructure should have some literacy around them, including the values that underlie them including transparency and modularity. Matterns also argues that infrastructure is not a revolutionary concept (though it has evolved since its inception in the 1920’s), but allows people to  “organize into communities and share resources amongst themselves.”  It is this self-organizing quality that necessitates better interfaces that reflect how communities want to and should interact with structures <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Discussions on the biases in the process of big data research can be found in the literature of the past decade. A primary example is the idea that racist data leads to racist algorithms. Noble challenges the idea that scientific research is impartial, that it levels the playing field for  “all forms of ideas, identities, and activities”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Negative biases are embedded in search engine results for black girls, where suggested searches are radically different from those for white girls. This results in biased search algorithms that privilege whiteness and oppress people of color. There is an increasing awareness of this issue - O’Neil et al. lay out situations where algorithms have the potential to amplify the biases and exacerbate the disparities present in society. Arenas such as going to college, online advertising, justice and law enforcement, getting a job and job performance, getting credit, and getting insurance can all be dangerously affected by algorithms’ increasing role in the decision making process <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. O’Neil calls for auditing in all steps of the data science development process <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Additional research in the field of bias, discrimination, and oppression in algorithms and what to do about them are abundant <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Kaplan, in his map of big data research in digital humanities, briefly raises the question of bias and notes that choices need to be made in the process of digitally translating from primary sources into high-level human-processible insights and that the inevitable biases that result from these choices apply <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. We support a solution, not by codifying any particular set of standards, but by allowing these choices to be questioned in all steps in the pipeline, and changed directly by the questioner.</p>
<p>As a result, the pipeline values of modularity, subjectness to dissent, and interchangeability is apparent in many of the web portals available today — but not in all. Perhaps the work that most closely mirrors our viewpoint is Edmond’s Data Soup, which describes an architecture and pipeline for text search and selection used in the <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> project with an emphasis on modularity of the processing algorithms and reproducibility. These works, however, deal mainly with the process of data preparation and selection, rather than the whole process of research, all the while treating it primarily as something to be done, rather than something to think about, discuss, and debate. Often times, in Digital Humanities, the description of the process is sidelined to the appendix or not discussed at all, which precludes any possibility of critical review of the pipeline. In fact, in a survey of close and distant reading techniques, <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> found that many papers using sophisticated data analysis techniques do not even provide sufficient information about the preprocessing steps to be reproducible, let alone facilitate discussions on these processes. We argue that it is not enough for the data analysis tool to be sophisticated and user-friendly, but that all steps in the data analysis pipeline be truly transparent and modular. Mattern argues for a collective consciousness of  “citizens/users”  of infrastructure around both awareness of and critical listening and thinking around infrastructure, implicitly making an argument for these values <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Mattern references  “path dependency,”  a concept coined by Edwards et al., where past decisions limit future choices. While this is true of software, open source software gets around this dependency because the code is shared freely, with any infinite number of branches or forks possible from the original base code. If a scholar or user dislikes a past decision, they can change it so that future choices are not limited by a previous developer’s choices. Thus, the software not only is transparent and modular and subject to dissent, but allows scholars and users to go beyond dissent and towards action and agency to diverge from the path.</p>
<p>It is advantageous to the community of researchers to discuss ideas about infrastructural choices built into a particular pipeline. If we do collectively adopt the convention of publishing articles wherein we describe the pipelines we have designed — and perhaps other articles wherein we critique recent conventions in building infrastructure — then the community of knowledge will benefit by collectively learning. The author can describe the work that went into designing a pipeline that maximizes critical thinking. Places in the research project where the best algorithm is uncertain — the places that lend themselves to critical review — can be described and highlighted, and the community of researchers can grow in its awareness of these uncertainties and the biases they create on the research project. Herein lies a major opportunity for collective critique and argumentation around the ideas that structure our infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="the-pipeline-based-web-app">The Pipeline-Based Web App</h2>
<p>In most web applications in the digital humanities, some pipeline exists in the background, but some of its functions are obscured from the user. The visualizations displayed are based on the results of cleaning and topic modeling run behind the scenes and then uploaded to the web app for the researcher to interact with. Simple navigation by date or keyword allows the user to expand or explore particular aspects of the results. Toggle options exist, but they are limited to later parts in the pipeline. For example, in the VoyantTools web application, we can upload any text we want and toggle visualization settings, but there are no options for how the text is cleaned and tokenized and furthermore, the way these normalization steps are done is obscured from the user <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. InPhO Topic Viewer, one of the HathiTrust Research Center algorithms, is a more modular pipeline than VoyantTools because it provides some options in the text pre-processing and normalization parts of the pipeline. However, the only two options are the choice of tokenizer (of which there are only two useful selections for English texts) and whether or not to decode unicode characters <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In web applications inspired by the pipeline concept, the designers seek to highlight and expand particular choices made in all steps of the design of the pipeline, giving the user options for how the data is handled and presented. In an ideal pipeline-based app, the user would have control over every process in the pipeline, from choosing different stemming and cleaning options to visualizations, allowing the community to upload different possible algorithms.</p>
<p>By giving users the option of reviewing the choices behind any given analysis and visualization, the design principle of the pipeline-based app reinforces the possibility of scholarly dissent in analyzing and interpreting documents. Two scholars may have different instincts when it comes to how to clean the data, which topics are relevant to a query, or how to visualize the data, and these different instincts may lead them in different ways. To encourage a healthy climate of dissent and investigation, practitioners in the digital humanities need to incorporate design opportunities for dissent and counter-inspection of the evidence into the full pipeline of their software.</p>
<p>In a sense, then, valuing scholarly dissent means that interface designers must aspire to web-apps that perform like  <em>code</em>  in terms of their flexibility and interoperability, making every choice of algorithm transparent and interchangeable. The ideal pipeline-based application would, in a sense, lead the user through the experience of coding, where the coder typically chooses various packages that are assembled into a process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualization. One example of a pipeline-based tool is Jean-Philippe Cointet’s Cortext,<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  a platform that allows users to upload textual documents and queue them for cleaning and various transformations including named entity recognition, topic modeling, and vector analysis <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Pure pipeline-based tools have both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage, like the advantage of the pipeline itself, is the proliferation of the values of modularity, openness to dissent, and interoperability. Pipeline-based tools like Cortext recreate the experience of interactive, iterative coding with data for non-coders and mixed classrooms or readerships where not all who want to experience the data come from an equal background with respect to code.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage of existing pipeline-based tools are, generally speaking, features of first-wave design. For instance, some web interfaces designed by computer specialists often lack an eye for design principles that would make their use transparent to users, which results in interfaces that are cumbersome to use, for instance in the case of Zotero. Zotero is an application for curating, storing, and organizing journal articles, but it is possible to build text mining and visualization on top of it. With Zotero, a user can add or remove journal articles from their hand-curated collection, topic model their corpus, and view some results. Changing the inputs is trivial, but changing the parameters in modeling and visualization are not. In Zotero, the emphasis is on interoperability, not user-friendliness, with the result that some users may be put off an artificially abstract interface. Other web interfaces command limited access to computational resources, which results in the case of Cortext in long waiting times while users queue for a server. These are issues that could be remedied by later design and improvement. However, for designers to rebuild existing infrastructure to align with new principles, they would need access to grants that emphasize extending access to computational resources and usability.</p>
<p>Tool-builders who aspire to pipeline-level transparency and easy user interface may nonetheless adopt the principles of openness to dissent and interchangeability in certain  <em>parts</em>  of the research process, with the result of creating web interfaces that are more flexible, generative, and useful for scholarly debate than the first generation of web applications in the digital humanities. This article presents one such iteration, <a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a>, which aspires to the pipeline concept. It realizes this promise by transparency — that is, by documenting the background pipeline of its code for users — and by limited modularity, that is, allowing the user to choose different seed topics and tweak the z-value of our sorting algorithm. Transparency and open-source software give users options: if they want to change other parts of the pipeline, like for example lemmatizing rather than stemming, the code should be run again but with that parameter changed.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-hatori-a-pipeline-for-modeling-the-british-parliamentary-debates">Introducing HaToRI, a Pipeline for modeling the British Parliamentary Debates</h2>
<p><a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a> is the Hansard instance of the ToRI (Topic Relevance Identifier) tool. Its creation was motivated by the research questions asked of the Hansard British Parliamentary Debates data set by our scholarly collaborator, but it was built with a generic text analysis pipeline in mind. ToRI exemplifies the values of the pipeline concept in various ways. At the highest level, it is applicable to any text corpus with trivial customizations. For example, if a user likes all of the visualizations and features available in the <a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a> app but wants to create an instance of ToRI analyzing Twitter data, we can spin up a TweetToRI web app with slight modifications to the underlying ToRI code pipeline.</p>
<p>The code pipeline consists of three steps: we prepare and identify the topics of a corpus, a humanist selects topic(s) of interest, and we post-process the results. Post-processing consists of ranking the documents based on how prevalent the topic(s) of interest are, and using such a ranking for in-depth studies. We prepare a set of visualizations to illustrate how the topics cluster based on similarity, how their prevalence changed over time, etc. The choices that we made in each of the three steps were informed by the historical research aims and by the content and format of the Hansard data, but may not be the right choices for all data. They can be adjusted with ease for other data or research aims. For this reason, we believe that the pipeline driven web tool can greatly aid humanists in their research.</p>
<p>The ToRI web app takes inspiration from many other useful Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, most notably the Topic Explorer <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, but is distinguishable in its highly customizable end-to-end pipeline and novel document ranking algorithm. Many tools, like VoyantTools and OldBaileyVoices.org, are limited to basic keyword-based text analysis and corpus exploration <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. And while VoyantTools can accommodate various corpora, it does not accept a tab-separated value format that is ideal for corpora like Hansard that contain structured fields. Other tools explore and extract semantic sub-corpora by ranking documents <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, but use similarity to a single document or topic as the sorting value. Lengthy documents, in particular, can contain too much noise and a single topic does not capture the nuance that multiple topics can, resulting in a sub-corpus that potentially contains many false positives and leaves out harder to detect true positives. Meandre is a workflow tool that is modular and customizable to many corpora and offers a drag-and-drop interface for non-technical users to perform many NLP tasks including data cleaning, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. While it is user-friendly and feature-rich, it does not offer sub-corpus extraction using multiple topics.</p>
<p>The advantages of our pipeline over other corpus exploration tools are that they are self-contained and complete, modular, and open source. These qualities make the code generalizable to any corpus, in any format and highly adaptable to incorporate other algorithms or NLP decisions. Specifically, if a user does not agree with our choice of the stemming method (Snowball Stemmer), they can add a different algorithm (e.g., the Porter Stemmer) by changing two lines of code and then assess how the change influences the results.</p>
<p>Creating instances of the web app with other corpora requires the addition of a single, custom pre-processing script that converts the corpus to our generic data format. The generic format is a tab-separated file with three fields: Document ID, Text, and Year. The Document ID can be any identifier such as a sequence of integers or document titles if available and it needs to uniquely identify the documents. The Text field contains the full, natural text of the documents, prior to cleaning and stemming. Then, the rest of the pipeline can run without any modifications. The pipeline performs the complete set of tasks needed to transform natural language to machine-readable vectors, a noisy collection of words to a hierarchically sorted set of topics, and an impossibly large volume of text to a manageable sub-corpus of semantically relevant documents.</p>
<p>Additionally, the code is modular so the work required to make changes to the pipeline is trivial. The decisions we made at all points in the pipeline — such as our custom stopword list, our spell-checking dictionary, our decision to stem rather than lemmatize, topic modeling method and implementation, number of topics, document ranking algorithm, and z-value — can be customized to different corpora or user interests. The code is designed this way to make space for flexibility in decision-making; algorithms best suited for one corpus or domain may not be optimal for another corpus or domain. Furthermore, some of these decisions are built into the endpoint of the pipeline, the web app user interface, with no code changes required. For example, the z-value is a tune-able parameter that the user interacts with in a value entry bar on the detailed topic view pages of the web app. Future work will incorporate more user input at the endpoint. <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="comparing-applications-how-pipelines-broaden-the-scholarly-implications-of-research">Comparing Applications: How Pipelines Broaden the Scholarly Implications of Research</h2>
<p>The Hansard parliamentary debates are important information mines for scholars of British history and attempts to digitize Hansard date back to at least the 1970s. Open source versions of the nineteenth-century Hansard corpus have been freely available in a digitized version for at least a decade, which has made them the subject of a great deal of infrastructure design already. At least two applications allow users access to the debates today — the Hansard Corpus site, designed by a team of linguists at Glasgow and Brigham Young, and the Millbank Hansard site, commissioned by parliament itself of a private developer. The two existing applications have already enabled a flood of new research about language use in parliament <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the first generation of applications made little use of the pipeline concept. In many cases, little documentation was available about how the corpus had been cleaned. Users were allowed to search by keyword, year, and (in some cases) speaker or other named entity, but few tools offered other ways of navigating the corpus or matching a user’s interests. Hansard, thus, offers an ideal test-case for building a web application that models the advantages of modularity, openness to dissent, and interoperability, due, in part, to the heavy scholarly interest in the subject matter; the material covered by Hansard is the subject of interest in history, literature, linguistics, and geography. Moreover, an interoperable pipeline or pipeline-based app for working with the British Hansards could be easily extended to the Australian, Irish, and Canadian Hansards, the debates of the EU parliament, or any other digital corpus that represents the debates of a democratic body.</p>
<h2 id="interoperability-how-to-pipe-hatori-to-other-corpora">Interoperability: How to Pipe HaToRI to Other Corpora</h2>
<p>Unlike applications that readily ingest text data in the web browser without ever having to touch the underlying code, <a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a> requires some programming knowledge to adapt it to other corpora. The advantage of this approach is that the corpus can have associated structure and metadata beyond a single document of plain text. Additionally, minor code changes can be made in the process of spinning up another instance of ToRI, making the intermediary steps between data ingest and data visualization completely modular. To spin up an instance of ToRI for another corpus, clone the Inquiry for Philologic Analysis repository from Github and make modifications to the code in the src folder.</p>
<p>The pipeline is set up in  <code>main.py</code> . Each step in the pipeline can be toggled on or off by setting the switches at the top of the script. For example, to run the first step of the pipeline on the test data given, the user can toggle the  <code>to_tsv</code>  switch to True, and the sample 10 Hansard data will be converted to a tabular, tab-separated value (TSV) file. To ingest another corpus, the user must first convert the raw text to a TSV file. The TSV must represent a corpus as one row per document, and each document must have a unique identifier associated with it. The identifier is the first column in the TSV file and the text of the documents should be the second column. Metadata is optional - for <a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a> the speaker name and debate year were added as metadata by appending them as columns three and four. This step is unique to each data set - for Hansard we wrote a code ( <code>raw_corpus2tsv.py</code> ) to parse the data we needed from XML to TSV. For other corpora, the code will need to be custom written for the format it originates in.</p>
<p>The next step, data cleaning, is a single script ( <code>preprocess.py</code> ) that can be run as is, changed with minor code edits to accommodate different scholarly choices or domain-specific corpora, or replaced by a custom preprocessing script entirely. Tokenization is by word, but can be changed to ngrams (n-length word phrases). Non-alphanumeric characters are removed, but perhaps punctuation and special characters are important, such as with a Twitter data set. All text is lower-cased, though with texts with many abbreviations like medical notes, capitalization could be preserved. Spell-checking can be turned from on to off, and word truncating can be changed from stemming to lemmatization, or turned off completely. Common as well as custom stopwords are removed, and either or both stopwords lists can be turned off or modified. Once cleaning choices have been made and run, the user must download the MALLET program and run topic modeling with the desired numbers of topics, k. The output of the topic models are then ready to be loaded into the website.</p>
<p>There are two steps to creating the website: uploading the corpus and putting the website online. The user should clone the hatori repository from Github and change out the data in the serv/data/ folder with their own corpus. Then, once the website works locally, they should host the website using one of a variety of web hosting services. We suggest doing this through Github Pages<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  because of its integration with Github.</p>
<h2 id="methods-the-pipeline-outlined">Methods: the Pipeline Outlined</h2>
<p>The remainder of this paper describes a full NLP pipeline for sub-corpus extraction using topic-based search and tests the hypothesis that topics are better than keywords for discovering a thematically coherent sub-corpus that includes under-studied documents. We will describe the pipeline’s machinery in detail, which includes custom data extraction and pre-processing, conversion of the text corpus to a numeric and machine-readable data structure, topic modeling the corpus, document ranking and sub-corpus extraction, and visualization in a web app. We give an example scholarly use case to show how features of the web app work, and how the pipeline enables reproducible and interoperable digital humanities research and openness to dissent as a way of collaboration.</p>
<p>In characterizing the pipeline, we give a transparent description of the entire research project from raw text file (in this case; in others, it might be scanned documents) to visualizations. In emulating the value of transparency, this pipeline description highlights the opportunities for critical thinking along the way and how scholars can engage them. Indeed, we believe that this kind of description, which both illustrates the facts about the corpus and highlights the places for interpretive work by scholar-users, should become the standard for scholarly publications that document new scholarly infrastructures in the humanities.</p>
<h2 id="pre-processing">Pre-processing</h2>
<p>Here, we describe the process by which we turned the raw Hansard parliamentary debates into machine-readable material for downstream steps in the pipeline. The process described contains choices specific to the Hansard dataset, but it is modular and easily interchanged with a different suite of pre-processing steps.</p>
<p>We download Hansard from the web as a series of XML files<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  and parse full text and metadata from the XML into a tabular, tab-separated value (TSV) format using the Python programming language. The input data could be any collection of documents (news articles, tweets, political speech, etc.) in any text format (cannot be images or scans of documents), so long as it is converted into a TSV structured such that each row is a document. In the Hansard TSV file, each row is a debate and the columns are debate ID, full text, and metadata. We additionally append four written reports crucial to the historical analysis to our corpus. The result is a corpus made up of 45,585 speakers who uttered 294,203,233 words, 1,033,536 speech acts, and 111,689 debates.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows what parliamentary speech and the written reports look like over time. The number of debates per year correlates closely with the number of speakers per year, and they both increase over the course of the century with a notable spike in the last quarter century. The average length of our documents shows a weak inverse correlation. The number of speech acts and the number of unigrams per debate are both somewhat reduced in the last quarter of the century. In other words, as the number of debates and number of speakers increase, the speech acts tend to get less verbose over time.</p>

<p>As is standard in Natural Language Processing, we took steps to pre-process the corpus to prepare the text for downstream analysis. These steps include tokenization, removing non-alphanumeric characters, lowercasing, spell-checking, replacing both common stopwords and custom stopwords with a substitute word, and stemming. We walk through each step in detail during the rest of this subsection.</p>
<ul>
<li>We lowercase the corpus and then tokenize the documents by splitting the text on whitespace (e.g. spaces, tabs, returns). There are a variety of tokenizers to choose from (e.g. Penn Treebank, Punkt, Multi-Word Expression, Tweet, Regular Expressions, etc.) and we chose whitespace tokenization based on the structure of Hansard. This reduces our unit of text from paragraphs to words. Our corpus, Hansard, consists of 198,338 unique words.</li>
<li>We remove non-alphanumeric characters from each word, so they are free from punctuation, white space, and symbols. This reduces the vocabulary to 186,060 words. Other text corpora may require the removal of different characters, like emoji from tweets or html tags from data scraped from the web. Changes to the removal list are trivial to implement in the code pipeline.</li>
<li>We spellcheck the words using a dictionary of British English words provided by the Python library,  <em>enchant</em> . If the words in our vocabulary are in the dictionary, we keep the word; if they are not, we replace them with a substitute word that does not appear natively in our corpus. This reduces the vocabulary to 49,789 words. We also replace common stopwords (e.g. articles and conjunctions like the, and, or, it, etc. that have no semantic meaning) and custom stopwords (proper nouns) with a substitute word. Replacing stopwords reduces our vocabulary by less than one thousand words. We can, with minimal effort, swap out the British English dictionary for other language dictionaries or change the stopwords used.</li>
<li>We stem the words using Snowball Stemmer in the  <em>NLTK</em>  Python library. Stemming further decreases the size of the vocabulary by reducing inflected and derived words to their stem (base or root form) to avoid duplicate counting words that may have slightly different endings but the same semantic meaning. Rent, rents, rented, and renting would all be reduced to the stem, rent, and property and properties would both be reduced to the stem, properti. We call the stemmed words unigrams because stems like properti are not words. There are a number of different stemmers and lemmatizers to choose from, should the Snowball Stemmer be called into question.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the process, the original 294 million words are reduced to 97 million. Almost 200 million words are replaced by the substitute word because they are common stopwords (for example: a, an, the, I, you) or misspelled words. While the reduction seems significant, substitute words would contribute very little to the topic modeling results and thus minimal information is lost during the process. The final step in pre-processing is to create a document-term matrix, which is a numerical representation of the corpus that can be read and analyzed by a machine. Each document is represented by a vector of word counts. Different weights and normalizations can be applied to the document-term matrix, given the needs of the data or research.<br>
We illustrate how the various pre-processing steps reduces the number of unique unigrams in Hansard by a factor of 10. We get the greatest reduction in unique unigrams by spell-checking and stemming words.    Pre-processing Step  Number of unigrams  Number of non-substitute unigrams      All unigrams  198,338  196,642      Alphanumeric characters only  186,060  184,447      Correctly spelled unigrams  49,789  49,190      Stems  21,828  21,444</p>
<h2 id="topic-modeling">Topic Modeling</h2>
<p>The goal of applying NLP methods to Hansard is to answer historical questions about the shifting concepts of land ownership and property in the nineteenth-century British empire. Traditional historical scholarship involving close reading and analysis is not suited to this task because the text corpus is too large to be read by a single historian or even a team of researchers. Instead, we offload the task to a computer.</p>
<p>Topic models are probabilistic models for discovering the abstract topics that occur in a large corpus of documents through a hierarchical analysis of the text <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The idea is that a corpus is made up of topics, topics are distributions over a fixed vocabulary of terms, and documents are mixtures of topics in different proportions. The vocabulary of terms can be words or pre-processed tokens like unigrams or n-grams. Topic modeling can answer questions that would otherwise be intractable with a large corpus: (1.) What is a large, prohibitively long corpus of documents about? (2.) Can we extract a human-readable sub-corpus of semantically-related documents? A random process is assumed to have produced the observed data, which are the words that make up the documents in the corpus. Given the observed data, the posterior distribution of the hidden variables (word distributions for each topic, topic proportions for each document, topic assignment per word for each document) determines the hidden topical structure of the corpus which tells us what the corpus is about, answering the first question we seek to solve with topic modeling; the posterior estimates can be applied to tasks such as document browsing and information retrieval, answering our second question. In fact, topic modeling has been used as the basis for trawling for a smaller corpus <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The evaluation of topic modeling results is subjective, requiring manual inspection by subject matter experts and cannot replace the traditional textual analysis. The benefit, however, is that the subject matter experts need only to read through a handful of terms per topic rather than a significant part of the corpus. The drawback is that we lose vital information encoded in natural language when we numericize it. For example, the bag-of-words representation of a corpus loses context entirely by treating documents as unordered collections of words <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>; n-grams cannot preserve word relationships past their immediate neighbors <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>; and while vector models like word2vec and doc2vec preserve far-apart word relationships, they are not suitable for identifying a relevant sub-corpus within a large corpus <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We use a particular flavor of topic modeling called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. The model does not have a prior notion about the existence of the topics; it is given a hyperparameter, k, which describes how many topics are associated with the corpus, and discovers the k topics from the observed data, the words in the documents. The algorithm is implemented in a number of programming languages and is simple to use with few tunable parameters, but requires hand labeling of topics by subject matter experts. We use a Java implementation of LDA called MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit (MALLET) <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. In developing the pipeline, we made topic models with varying k values (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000) and different topic modeling methods like Non-negative Matrix Factorization <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> and Dynamic Topic Models <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> available to the users.</p>
<h2 id="extracting-a-sub-corpus">Extracting a Sub-corpus</h2>
<p>Within  <em><a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a></em> , the process of extracting a subcorpus starts with LDA. LDA not only tells us the topics that are discussed in a corpus, but also which ones each document contains. Knowing what documents are about allows us to narrow our focus to a smaller sub-corpus from the whole of Hansard, reading the debates and speech acts that are about our topic of interest — land and property. Sub-corpus extraction using topic modeling allows us to find a richer set of documents than keyword search alone because the topics are discovered from the data, rather than imposing domain-specific and subjective knowledge on the text. Keyword searches and term frequencies work well when the topic of interest can be unambiguously identified by one word or a short phrase. Documents in a corpus can be clustered based on similarity to one another and subject matter experts need to analyze each cluster to decide if the clusters make semantic sense and if any are about their topic of interest. This can only be done if the corpus is not too large and the experts can at the very least scan through each document. Sometimes it is already known that one or a few documents in a corpus are about the topic of interest and the question is whether there are other so far undiscovered relevant documents in the corpus? The goal then is to find documents which are similar to the seed documents. A search based on seed documents works if most words and terms in the seeds are about the topic of interest and not other general topics. This is not often the case. Our proposed method for sub-corpus extraction is a topic-model-based document ranking process where users choose multiple topics of interest, rank documents by how closely they match the topics of interest, explore the results, and iterate by toggling on or off particular topics. We harness a code pipeline to build a highly customizable web-app that makes available to the ordinary user a process of Critical Search characterized by iterative interaction with large corpora <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We use three steps in topic modeling: import, modeling, and post-processing. The first two steps are fairly straightforward parts of the MALLET program. In modeling, we tune the number of topics, keeping other hyperparameters (e.g. alpha and beta (priors), number of iterations, sampling method, etc.) constant. We created topic models with the number of topics equal to 100, 200, 500, and 1000. In post-processing, we asked a group of humanists to read the ten most heavily weighted words in each topic, give the topic labels based on those words, and qualitatively evaluate which k number of topics is ideal for Hansard (see the Results section for more details).</p>
<p>Sub-corpus extraction is done by ranking the documents in a corpus using their relevance to one or more topics of interest. The simplest ranking algorithm counts the relative frequency of topic words, or word occurrences assigned to at least one topic of interest, and ranks the documents with the highest frequencies as most relevant. However, this algorithm can incorrectly down-rank longer documents. We improve on this simple ranking algorithm by using the lower bound of Wilson score confidence intervals for a Bernoulli parameter, z, as the sorting value <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. The parameter z is tuneable and a larger z sporadically introduces longer documents into the top-ranked sub-corpus; in our web app, the user can visually explore how increasing z changes the rankings by reading the document titles and linking to the full text of the documents. Different values of z may be optimal for sub-corpus extraction depending on the topics of interest and the user’s goals.</p>
<p>We argue that topic-based sub-corpus extraction is a highly effective way to identify a relevant sub-corpus and highlight this point in the context of exploring past land use and eviction in the British Parliamentary debates.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-searching-for-property-in-hansard">Use Case: Searching for Property in Hansard</h2>
<p>Parliamentary speech has been carefully archived since 1803 and is available as a digitized resource called the Parliamentary Debates; it contains full transcriptions of all of the spoken words in the British Parliament from 1803 to 1908 as well as metadata like speaker name, speaker constituency, date of speech, and debate titles.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  The collection is commonly referred to as Hansard after Thomas Curson Hansard, a London publisher and first official printer to the parliament. We use the terms Parliamentary Debates and Hansard interchangeably throughout this paper. Hansard provides a rich corpus for text analysis using Natural Language Processing methods because its digitization is high quality (low errors in optical character recognition) and it is comprehensive, spanning over two centuries and hundreds of millions of words of speech.</p>

<p>Because of the volume and breadth of topics in Hansard, it is a valuable resource for historical and socio-political analyses by students and scholars, alike. And while there is great value in being publicly available in its entirety, it is difficult to narrow down to smaller excerpts of interest in its existing online forms. We create a pipeline that ingests the Hansard data and presents it in a new digital space, the <a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a> web app, that broadens the horizons of possibility for digital humanities research and collaboration. We present a case study in using the web app for a historical analysis of how ideas about land and property changed in the nineteenth-century British empire in the following sections. However, the tool is modular and can be applied with some modification to any number of analyses by selecting a different focal point other than the land topics or swapping out the Hansard corpus for another collection of text.</p>
<p>While historical scholarship on Hansard is rich and varied due to the completeness of the resource, there is a lack of research about the changing discourse of property in Hansard. In contrast, there is extensive research on four written reports specific to land and property <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. They were commissioned by the Queen and are commonly aliased by the name of the lords who wrote the report: Napier, Bessborough, Richmond, and Devon. A major shift occurred between the Devon and Bessborough Reports (1845-1881), from greater landlord protections to greater tenant protections, due in part to massive resistance in colonies of the Empire like Ireland, Scotland, and India <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. The Encumbered Estates Act of 1849 disadvantaged tenants trying to improve their holdings by moving property with outstanding debts from Irish to English owners; Gladstone’s Irish Land Act of 1881 advantaged tenants by introducing the first rent control law in history, in addition to redistributing landlord property to Irish tenants <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. We might attribute the large amount of scholarship on the reports to both the specificity of the subject matter of the reports and also, to a citation feedback loop, where historians produce much research about widely cited sources because of their ubiquitousness in the literature. While studying these documents so extensively is valuable, it creates bias in the historical analysis by leaving out more uninvestigated primary sources.</p>
<p>Contemporary ideas about property that favor tenant protections, a normalized cultural expectation that is often codified into law, have a long and bloody history that can in part be traced back to the revolts and reforms that occurred in the nineteenth-century British empire. A major shift from favoring landlords to tenants in areas like land distribution, eviction, fair rent, is theorized to have occurred from the first half to the second half of the century <sup id="fnref1:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. The evidence presented in the following section supports this theory.</p>
<h2 id="results-and-visualizations">Results and Visualizations</h2>
<p>The historical analysis that follows is one of many possible threads of questioning into the Hansard body of text. We demonstrate how to explore the question of how the parliamentary discourse of property changed in the nineteenth-century, using the choices made in developing the code pipeline and the user- and visualization-driven search through the web app parameters. The threads of questioning, driven by scholars and research interests, can be approached in a new way that leans on digital tools for a deeper dive into large bodies of text. Historical claims are still made through close reading and analysis; but using topic-based search to guide close reading and analysis, we open a new and focused window into a previously under-studied primary source. In the next section, we both validate our hypothesis from the secondary literature and introduce new perspectives — of members of parliament — into the body of knowledge about British land reform.</p>
<h2 id="five-out-of-five-hundred-topics-are-relevant-for-land-and-property">Five Out of Five Hundred Topics are Relevant for Land and Property</h2>
<p>An early choice made in the pipeline is what the ideal number of topics (k) is for the Hansard corpus. We pre-computed topic models at different increments of k (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000) for review. Humanists determined that the optimal number of topics is 500 because of the uniqueness and specificity of the topics. Some topics are difficult to label distinctly from other topics in the 1000 topic model, while most topics could be given unique labels in the 500 topic model. Five distinct land-related topics, their ten most heavily weighted words, and their designated labels are shown in Table 2. They are sorted by the year(s) in which they peaked, with early peaks on the left and late peaks on the right. The language used to describe land in Hansard mirrors the historical shifts of the period, from an agriculturally valued plot in the first half of the century to a rental relationship between landlords and tenants in the middle of the century and to legal protections that favored tenants in the latter half of the century — protections that included rent restrictions, freedom from arbitrary evictions, and land redistributions <sup id="fnref1:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>.<br>
Five land-related topics from our 500 topic model of Hansard. They are sorted on when they peaked. The first half of the century does not talk about land as much as a rental agreement but in terms of its productivity. The second half of the century considers the question of land as rental agreement and the legal protections and rights for both sides of the agreement.    17. Land value measured in agricultural output  46. Land value measured as a tax for the church and as rental income for landlords  447. Property as a rental relationship between landlords and tenants  35. Negotiating the interests of landowners vs. tenants who seek to improve their rentals  180. Legal protections for tenants      1820, 1846  1827-1840  1838, 1892  1847-1850, 1882  1882-1904      farmer  tith  leas  properti  rent      agricultur  rent  year  land  land      land  clergi  rent  estat  case      price  charg  leasehold  proprietor  commiss      produc  land  lesse  owner  commission      farm  commut  land  interest  fix      cultiv  owner  term  possess  fair      year  collect  tenant  person  court      interest  landlord  properti  valu  chief      crop  payment  case  improv  applic   <br>
We build this process of preparing, reviewing, and labeling different k values into the code pipeline. While the computational cost of preparing different models is not reduced, the human effort of maintaining code and documentation on many models is greatly reduced.</p>
<h2 id="spikes-in-the-discussion-of-land-use-and-rent-in-1850-and-1880">Spikes in the discussion of land use and rent in 1850 and 1880</h2>
<p>Figure 3 shows topic 35, which we named  “Negotiating the interests of landowners vs. tenants who seek to improve their rentals” . This topic peaks twice in the late 1840s and early 1850s and then peaks again in 1870 and 1880, mirroring the historical arc of this topic. The Devon and Bessborough Commissions were ordered and written in 1845 and 1881 because of calls for land reform from peasant farmers and tenants <sup id="fnref2:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. This topic is one of several that point the scholar to the land question, and in combination they can paint a fuller, richer picture of the topic than any single excerpt of Hansard or written report.</p>

<h2 id="topic-modeling-is-better-to-extract-a-sub-corpus-than-word-frequencies">Topic modeling is better to extract a sub-corpus than word frequencies</h2>
<p>We present a land and property example that illustrates how topic modeling goes beyond word frequencies for historical analysis. Figure 4 shows word frequencies for the most commonly occurring words in topic 35. The word frequencies are normalized by the total number of unigrams in each year and are shown per 10,000 words. Four peaks stand out: “person” in the early part of the period and “land” in the late part of the period. “Land” and “properti” have a few smaller peaks throughout the period. The pattern does have some historical significance, but it is certainly noisier than the peaks in topic frequency seen in Figure 3. There is no clear peak in the middle of the century where we would expect to see massive activity about this topic, which could potentially lead us to miss some interesting and important documents. Furthermore, if we were to search for documents of interest in Hansard using these frequently occurring keywords, we would likely incur many false negatives that are skewed towards the years in which the word counts peaked.</p>

<p>The screenshots shown in Figures 3 and 4 are taken from the <a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a> web app. The tool allows humanists to interact with their corpora in a user-friendly, visual, iterative, and exploratory process and avoids the time and resource penalties that traditional search and close reading of corpora incur. We will walk through the various features of the tool with accompanying screenshots in this next section with an emphasis on how the tool enhances digital humanities research by incorporating some of the values of code pipelines discussed in the introduction.</p>
<p>The tool approaches visual topic exploration at different levels or views: word, document, and topic. Taken together in a single interface, these levels give the user a three-dimensional view of their corpus that is less possible when searching for specific words, documents, or topics in silo. The n-gram plot in Figure 5 shows word frequencies per year for the top six words in a topic. Each line in the plot shows frequencies for a given word and each word in the plot is also shown on the right as a button; they can be removed from the plot by clicking on the words and the plot will dynamically re-scale based on the frequencies present in the current plot window. Words can be added by searching the vocabulary in the search bar. The search results filter down as the user types a query because corpora are often pre-processed differently, resulting in a vocabulary made up of stems or lemmas rather than actual words. The frequencies can be shown in absolute terms or relative, normalized to the total number of words in the year. The word view gives the user a finer-grained view of the corpus, but leaves out the greater context and interaction of the words.</p>

<p>Figures 6 and 7 show topic views of the corpus. The home page shows the first view, where each topic is a word cloud showing the top words in the topic. The size of the word indicates its probability within the topic; bigger words are more likely to be sampled from the topic than smaller words. The page scrolls and loads one chunk of word clouds at a time. The user can filter to a smaller subset of topics by searching for unigrams in the search bar at the top right corner of the page. The alternate view shows a table view of the topics with an additional sort functionality that will sort the topics based on any of the table fields. They can be sorted by their ID, by mean peak year, alphabetically by words, or by their proportion in the corpus. The recommended navigational flow of the corpus exploration part of the tool is to start at one of these two topic overviews and drill down closer into a single topic. Figure 8 shows a detailed topic view. The view includes more top words than the overviews, a plot of the topic over time, a link to the n-gram plot, and a sorted table of documents that are most associated with the topic. The detail view allows the user to explore the topic from various different vantage points, but does not allow multi-topic exploration. All topics are shown in the plot on the left in Figure 9, and they are arranged based on their similarity to each other. Topics with very similar word distributions cluster together and topics with very dissimilar word distributions are very far apart.</p>

<p>Figure 10 shows ranked documents relevant to the five land-related topics shown in Table 2 for z = [0, 100, 500]. For land topics, larger z values produce a better ranking than smaller z values. There are documents from the early and late periods of the century, near the peaks of land-related activity that we expect. Also, three out of four written reports, denoted by the prefix seed-, are in the top-ranked documents list when z = 500; we expect the written reports to be ranked highly because the historical literature confirms that they are key documents summarizing land use in the nineteenth-century. The low proportion of topic tokens out of total tokens in the written reports — 0.031, 0.066, and 0.156 for the Bessborough, Richmond, and Devon reports, respectively — indicates that the seed reports contain a lot of noise and shows the weakness of an earlier document-based approach compared to our topic-based approach <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this paper, we introduce the pipeline concept as a means for scholars to conduct transparent, modular, and interoperable research and we create a web app that exemplifies these values. We make the <a href="https://brown-ccv.github.io/hatori/page/home/">HaToRI</a> instance of the web app digitally available, and present a use case for doing enhanced historical analysis on the Hansard text corpus using the app. We explored how topic modeling can be used for sub-corpus extraction when other methods likely fail due to the sheer size of the corpus or nuances in the topics of interest that cannot be accurately captured by keywords or terms. To illustrate the advantages of topic modeling in sub-corpus extraction, we extracted a sub-corpus specific to land use, rent, and property from the Hansard British Parliamentary debates of the 19th century. There are two historically relevant periods when land use and property was exhaustively discussed in the Parliament: the 1850’s and 1880’s. We illustrate that topic-based sub-corpus extraction identifies these two eras based on the frequencies of the relevant topics, while keywords tend to wash out the signal and identify false peaks in the frequency plot. We described our pre-processing and post-processing steps in detail and provide a web app with a set of visualizations and functionalities to aid humanist research on the Hansard corpus. These functionalities include topic clustering based on similarity, document ranking based on topic prevalence, and frequency plots. The source codes for the pipeline and the web app are publicly available and can be modified to work with other corpora. We believe that topic modeling, in particular, as well as our novel document ranking algorithm, are well suited to extract a relevant sub-corpus for in-depth studies, especially if the corpus is prohibitively long to read by humans.</p>

<p>Digital technology has flooded the theatre. On stage, it is omnipresent: image projections, real-time transformations of the actors&rsquo; voices, interactions between the performers and the stage enhanced by all kinds of devices. Behind the scenes, there is no longer a single sound or light control room that is not digital, with the exception of shows in the dark, in daylight or flickering candlelight or even the rare performances without a sound broadcasting system. However, it is not just about the shows. Creative processes are also impacted, as are other aspects of theatrical activity: distribution of works, criticism, public reception, communication, financing. If one wants to study the performing arts today, it is impossible not to take into account companies&rsquo; websites, blog and online newspaper articles, recordings broadcast on Youtube or Vimeo, social networks, email exchanges, budget tables, ticketing software. Today, directors&rsquo; notebooks also take the form of Word files, image-based blogs on Tumblr or Instagram, posts on Facebook, Evernote notebooks, Pinterest tables, task lists in Trello, exchanges in Slack. The traces of the performing arts have become digital traces. This phenomenon has been driven by two major trends: the emergence of the born-digital heritage and theatre archives digitization.</p>
<p>The digital traces of the performing arts irremediably change not only the nature of the sources on which we rely to analyze works and write the history of performing arts but also how these studies are conducted and their results. The transformation of the trace into data-based information, making data a new type of source, is fraught with consequences for the memory of the ephemeral theatre, consequences that are not yet fully measured by the various actors, be they cultural institutions, librarians or researchers. Historiography in a digital context is not a revival of quantitative history in the strict sense of the term. It calls first and foremost for practices, and it is also in this practice that the narrative is housed. It is because it is a question of practice, and not just of exposing traces, but instead of exposing them to manipulation that a paradigm shift is taking place, inviting us to make history differently. Because the traces are transformed, they invite a renewal of the critique of sources that we thought we knew and make research questions evolve and lead to other epistemologies. The digital turn proposes a paradigm shift in how we build the memory of performing arts by renewing source criticism, methodological thinking, and narratives, moving beyond traditional methods of close reading to computational assisted reading and contributing to the general reflection on digital history.</p>
<p>How can performing arts digital traces be interpreted? What methodologies can be advanced to make them talk? The specificity of these traces leads to specific methodological responses, especially since the aim here is to interpret the traces in both directions of understanding and replayability. This is as much a question of developing a reflection on the conditions for the recovery of creative work as it is of analyzing an artistic approach based on its digital traces. Traditional methods, in particular close reading, i.e., a reading, a precise analysis of each of the traces, have to be combined with new approaches.</p>
<p>This growing awareness lead me to the creation of a software prototype, Rekall, and a web application, MemoRekall, which I am still developing today. Both environments are free and open source. Rekall and MemoRekall provide new opportunities of interpreting digital documents for performing arts research. They offer different and unexpected points of view on a dataset, either from a distant or a close reading approach, either by extracting metadata or by linking documents. Furthermore, the softwares take into account the open nature of the digital archive, which reconfigures itself as new documents are added, new links are created, and allow collaborative research.</p>
<p>From an epistemological point of view, the creation of these tools is anchored in the emergence of a new field of research that can be called theatre analytics. Theatre analytics are based on data from the traces of the performing arts. In line with culture analytics, the term refers to the calculation and emphasizes the analysis of works, which is the foundation for the preservation and historiography of the performing arts. In both cases it is a matter of following in detail a process to show why and how a work is constituted by observing its various components and of borrowing from mathematics to study, preserve and write a history of the performing arts. Theatre analytics does not challenge existing methodologies but allows them to be supplemented by taking into account what is generally discarded, namely, digital traces, considered too complex, too numerous, too fragile, with dubious authenticity. The aim is not to promote an approach that would be purely quantitative or statistical but on the contrary to see how qualitative analyses can also be conducted in a digital context. Unlike the general approach of big data in the social sciences and humanities, where we seek to determine general, average, profile categories or repeatable (or even predictable) patterns, our primary concern remains to seize the singular, the detail, the difference, the anomaly in a constant round trip between the micro and the macro dimensions, and looking for mesoscales. In the tracking of the singular at the core of big data, the deviation from the mean is made visible as such and no longer as an error against a standard. Nor is it a question of considering that singularity would be calculable, as some research on emotions or creativity seems to state by reducing digital traces to mathematical artifacts. On the contrary, we argue for an approach where the singular, the ideosyncraric  <em>via</em>  computational methods, be the focus of a qualitative interpretation. Data visualisation is ultimately qualitative and must give rise to an accurate and informed reading. As Johanna Drucker, who calls for a  “visual epistemology,”  points out  “Visualizations are always interpretations — data does not have an inherent visual form that merely gives rise to a graphic expression”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In this light, the ambition of theatre analytics is to offer a different way of looking at big data that is more oriented towards complexity, rather than the quantity of data, with a diversity of computer approaches depending on the nature of the data and the research questions asked. Alongside other methodologies less specific to the performing arts but which can also beRekall and MemoRekall afforts such an approach. Part of the text is missing : Alongside other methodologies less specific to the performing arts but which can also be convened (NLP, network analysis, machine learning, algorithm creation, &hellip;) Rekall and MemoRekall afforts such an approach.</p>
<p>This paper will explicate the development context of Rekall and MemoRekall and provide lessons learnt from this experiment. The detailed technical functions of the two softwares can be found elsewhere <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. The question can be asked how a performing arts researcher comes to develop new software applications? To explain this, first, I will set out the specificity of the problems generated by the digital traces of the performing arts. Second, main objectives of the project and the choices that result from it are explained. Third, the different stages of development and in particular the collaborations with artistic teams, programmers and designers are laid out.</p>
<h2 id="the-digital-traces-of-the-performing-arts">The digital traces of the performing arts</h2>
<p>Compared to non-digital traces, what do digital traces change for the preservation, analysis of works and the performing arts history? Let us take the tip of the iceberg of technological obsolescence and big data. A creative process, from its initial ideas to the première, lasts an average of four years - the same length as that of a technological cycle. In other words, at the moment of the première, it is necessary to update the management software and computer systems accompanying the tour, to save and sort the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of documents related to the work in a new version. As soon as the work is created, the artistic and technical team is confronted with problems of technological obsolescence and a quantity of information that may have a decisive impact on the production and its distribution of the work and can even, in the medium term, make it impossible to tour.</p>
<p>The preservation of performances is not the only phenomenon concerned by these issues. The creative processes are also affected. To take the example of the director&rsquo;s notebooks, in 20 years, who will remember applications such as Trello, Slack, Evernote or Tumblr? Will we be able to read the digital traces that have been stored and have access to the data they contain while guaranteeing their authenticity? Not only are performances ephemeral, which is inherent to the performing arts, but their digital traces seem even more evanescent. They are also increasingly numerous, overwhelming us with a continuous flow of data, in an unprecedented disproportion. These questions are not all new, but their amplification gives them a new acuity. How can we write the history of the performing arts from not only fragile and variable traces, but also too numerous at for researcher or archivist?</p>
<p>It is undeniable that, today, digital technology involves radical, and even irreversible, changes in our relationship to memory, history, and what is left as a legacy. Given this, one can but note that memory and the digital seem to oppose each other. This need not be so. Reconciling them is essential. Digital traces cannot be ignored in building and safeguarding the memory of the performing arts. These issues are complex and urgent. If nothing is done, the technological obsolescence of digital technology will overtake all other considerations, and an entire part of our culture will vanish.</p>
<p>To take a concrete example, under the title  <em>Re: Walden</em> , are regrouped different avatars of the same creative work, developed by the French director Jean-François Peyret from 2006 to 2014. This involved two installations (2010 and 2013 at Le Fresnoy, France), performances in the installation, four scenic versions (including one for the Avignon 2013 festival, France), a concert at EMPAC (USA) and an extension in the virtual environment  <em>Second Life</em> . Between 2012 and 2013, I collected several hard disks from the artistic team. These were those of Thierry Coduys (electroacoustic and computer devices), Agnès de Cayeux (virtual world) and Julie Valéro (dramaturgy). Although this collection is mostly incomplete (ideally, access to all the digital data of each member of the artistic team would have been required), the data collected were 10,360 files for 20.5 GigaBytes.</p>
<p>The files collected include the following elements: scores<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> , photographs and video recordings of rehearsals and performances, sound recordings for voice synthesis, sound files as well as computer programs (Max/MSP and Pure Data patches), images, management documentation (contacts, schedules&hellip;), technical sheets, room plans, communication documents (playbills, press releases, reviews published in newspapers or blogs), archived e-mails, screenshots of  <em>Second Life</em> , texts for each of the actors or texts from the automatic translator developed for the project, meeting minutes, notes of intent from the artistic team.</p>
<p>This example is symptomatic of digital traces of the performing arts, even if it concerns a complex creation that takes place over several years. They are heterogeneous, numerous but incomplete and fragile. The digital traces of the performing arts are heterogeneous, both in terms of the type of file (image, sound, text, video, computer program) and their content. All is happily mixed without any distinction and with the elements of the show such as aspects about the creative process or publicity compaigns, and the tour. These three aspects make it possible to define three main categories of digital traces that correspond to the main chronological stages in the life of a performance: the creative process, the work, audience reception. We can add a fourth one, not represented here: the administrative digital traces of cultural institutions and companies, i.e., everything related to the production of shows.</p>
<p>There are many digital traces, so much so that the term big data is used. We have counted several thousand files for  <em>Re: Walden</em> . The situation is nothing new, and we can only observe the inflation of digital traces. However, despite their impressive volume, the traces are far from being exhaustive. Besides, some tasks left only minimal traces, for example there were only a few photos and patches in the Pure Data software for the residency at the École Régionale d&rsquo;Acteurs de Cannes. Finally, digital traces do not take into account a large part of the exchanges, actions, and reflections taking place on and off the set, if they had not been systematically recorded or were in the form of reports and notes. Part of the digital activity itself rarely leads to the creation of preserved traces, like the one that takes place on electronic networks, such as documents shared on Google drive, conversations on Skype or applications such as Slate or Trello, images made available on Tumblr.</p>
<p>Digital traces are fragile. The duration of access and readability of a digital file might be five years. So that not only are we faced with ephemeral works, but also with traces increasingly fragile. For a large part of them, in a few years, especially those from proprietary software (Word for example), we will probably no longer be able to open them and therefore read them. The loss of traces seems to be an unavoidable phenomenon. In fact, many artists have already lost not only traces but also creative works.</p>
<p>In this overview, we understand that digital traces exacerbate both the properties of analogical traces, while at the same time differentiating themselves from them. As for the first observation, linked to heterogeneity, number or fragility, it is ultimately merely a question of accentuating phenomena already well identified in the analogical world. The great diversity of the nature of documents in the performing arts collections; the inflation of archives is a recurring problem identified, notably by Krzystof Pomian <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, where paper ends up being reduced to dust, inks are erased, magnetic strips become electronic snow. Despite the appearance of continuity, in fact digital technology fundamentally changes the ontology of the trace. To use Bruno Bachimont&rsquo;s expression, we have gone from a graphic reason<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> to a  “computational reason”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. As they become numerical, traces are coded and presented as numbers, which allows for computational calculation. This makes the question of reading traces and their authenticity complex (for they must be decoded) while opening up to being manipulated. In other words, digital traces are  “analyzable” , in the triple sense of discretization (the decomposition of a thing into its elements), computer calculation and data visualization. Analytical geometry, attributed to Descartes that allows a graphic representation of algebra, is the prelude to contemporary data visualizations. The digital traces of the performing arts thus presents several paradoxes: technological obsolescence versus full archiving, authenticity versus modification, and repetition versus ephemerality.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-crossroads">At the crossroads</h2>
<p>In 2006, as a performing arts researcher, I conducted a case study on Belgian choreographer Michèle Noiret on technological obsolescence issues about the performing arts at the margins, given that the works are inherently ephemeral. The case study was part of the DOCAM research program (2005-2010) led by the Daniel Langlois Foundation in Montreal on the documentation and preservation of media arts. The programme includes numerous partners, including museums. It builds on the pioneering work of the Langlois Foundation and John Ippolito on the variable media approach <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Jon Ippolito will then publish with Richard Rinehart  <em>Re-Collection</em>   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. In museums, the very concrete question of technological obsolescence of works was raised. Pip Laurenson proposed new conservation paradigms in questioning the central notions of state and authenticity <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Faced with these questions, the researcher&rsquo;s natural reflex is to identify existing solutions. Best practice guidelines and case studies were published as part of international projects (Interpares, DOCAM, Caspar) <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>; researchers worked on specific ontologies <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>; some artists - particularly choreographers - in collaboration with scientists, proposed solutions for a work or set of works <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. However, no existing solution seemed able to solve the concrete problems identified in the performing arts field. They can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can technical teams be enabled to take quick notes during rehearsals and to aggregate all technical documents? The different control rooms are separate, each one (lighting designer, general manager, video director, sound engineer) has its documentation system in digital or paper format, more or less structured with each participant defines his or her working method, his or her guide to best practices.</li>
<li>How can a show a few months or a few years later be restaged while respecting as carefully as possible the initial artistic intentions? Due to built-in digital obsolescence, technologies must be continuously adapted during the show tour. In addition, when the creative team is not the same as the touring team, rigorous documentation is required.</li>
<li>How can we compensate for the memory loss caused by digital technology? It becomes difficult to trace the history of the creative processes, especially since the documents they generate are themselves ephemeral, if nothing else, in their intended use.</li>
<li>What status and place should be given to video recording? A widespread practice, with varying results regarding the quality of video recording implementation, it systematically calls for comment. Video recordings  <em>per se</em>  are not self-sufficient. Most often produced by the company itself (for promotional purposes), they are nevertheless one of the most significant traces of the art work.</li>
<li>How can one move through the hundreds, sometimes thousands of documents to reconstruct the creation process? How can data visualization contribute to the analysis of a creative work&rsquo;s genetic analysis? By comparing different processes, is it possible to identify forms, patterns?</li>
<li>The digital traces of the works are very numerous and the reading of each trace is almost impossible. The question becomes rather: what information, what knowledge about the works is it possible to extract from all the traces for preservation purposes? What data should be used to reconstruct a creative process?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to respond, at least partially, to these challenges, I published a first paper <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> proposing a conceptual model of a computer solution articulating documents around the video recording of a performance. In contrast to the practice of creating a specific interface for each performance, I designed a software that can be applied to as many creative works as possible. As my concerns increasingly met those of cultural institutions confronted with the obsolescence of technologies - and the costs that this entails in addition to the difficulty of presenting works to the public - I decided to develop the software by myself. At the end of 2012, I raised the first funds that enabled me to hire a team of developers. Five years after the first draft, the situation had changed. The issues of big data and digital traces mentioned above could no longer be ignored. It was necessary to go beyond the articulation of a documentary corpus around a video recording. In the preparatory meetings that followed, the guiding principles of the project, first entitled  <em>Éclats</em>  (in reference to the fragmentation and multiplicity of documents) and then  <em>Rekall</em>  (in reference to the memory company in K. Dick&rsquo;s  <em>We Can Remember It for You Wholesale</em> ), were clarified. From the outset, Open Source was a self-evident option. Indeed, some funders such as the French Ministry of Culture imposed the Open Source option. Beyond that, Open Source is a prerequisite for the sustainability of the solutions developed. It would have been antinomic and counterproductive to proceed otherwise in a project dedicated to the preservation of art works.</p>
<p>Rekall is an environment prototype to document and analyze creative processes, and to simplify the preservation of performances. It uses the metadata present in all documents of a performance in order to extract crucial data (author, date, place, keyword) then used by data visualization tools to indicate behaviors. In this way, Rekall provides an overview of the creation process and identifies the most important documents (which will then have to undergo specific preservation measures). The software can also be used during rehearsals (for example, to annotate documents, review the history of a plot sheet), or once the creation is completed (to understand its process, distinguish documents related to the work from those related to its production). Rekall is cross platform. It is developed with the Qt development framework. For each version of a document, Rekall extracts all available metadata using the open source tool exiftool. The interface is in HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
<p>Two primary objectives guided Rekall&rsquo;s design: to help artists (the first curators of their works) to document their creations in order to ensure their retrieval and overcome the obsolescence of digital technologies; to help researchers study the genetics of performances in a context of born-digital heritage and Big Data. These two objectives may seem very distant at first sight. However, it is the same materials (digital traces of the works) that are collected, analyzed and visualized based on different modalities and time scales. In this way, the collection can take place for the artists during the creative process itself, as the work stages progress. A living archive emerges in perpetual movement. The researcher intervenes once the process is completed, once the documents have somehow stabilized, frozen to become the traces of what has happened. Rekall must, therefore, be able to be used from the onset of the first ideas of a show, during the creative process and then after its creation, with a dual perspective of preservation of the work and historiography.</p>
<p>Very quickly, it became clear to us that we had to develop a multimodal environment that included both digitized documents and natively digital documents. The digital traces of the performing arts include texts, images, sounds, videos, computer programs. A common practice of big data is to separate documents by file type and work in the form of silos (e.g. text, image). Such processing prevents us from obtaining an overview of the traces collected and from examining many phenomena such as the evolution of an idea through different documents, from image to text, from text to table, from table to video recording. Besides, it is essential to navigate between the micro and macro dimensions, between close reading and distant reading, between diachronic and synchronic representations. In other words, being able to represent a process without erasing its complexity; to switch from data to file and back again. Often, distant reading and data visualization involve a break between the source file and the data from which it is extracted. Maintaining this link is fundamental for several reasons. The data are always reductive fragments and it is important to be able to recontextualize them in order to interpret them better. The transition from a trace to data is a reductive and interpretive operation. Reduction also means making a precipitate of traces, which makes it possible to amplify and exhale a phenomenon that would otherwise have remained invisible. The transformation affords new insights into the tracks and allows us to detect clues that would otherwise have gone unnoticed. The use of data visualization is essential in the case of performance preservation to capture the main steps of the creative process and to identify the main files that will then need to be actively preserved, often on a case-by-case basis. In a very concrete way, in a corpus of 10,000 documents, the process of visualization must make it possible to identify the 50 documents that the researcher must read in detail to analyze the work or that the artistic team must migrate or emulate to continue touring.</p>
<p>Among the traces of the performing arts, the video recording is a particular type of document. It has long been - and is still often - considered as a panacea regarding documentation of the ephemeral performing arts. Provoking many debates since the 1960s, often considered as a betrayal of the original work <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, video recordings have now become commonplace. A video recording is both an essential and a fragmented document. In its essential form, it records bodies in movement and thus transforms performances into documents. In its fragmented form, it gives only one point of view, presenting only a part of what takes place on stage, generating temporal collusion through editing, adapting stage lighting to the lighting conditions of the cameras. A commentary, that is to say, an annotation must necessarily accompany these modifications. Two types of strategies are developed in order to overcome the shortcomings or biases of video recording: inter-documentary (connecting the video-capture to a larger documentary corpus) and intra-documentary (annotating the video-capture). These two approaches can be usefully combined. They simultaneously play different roles with the document, between the deepening and connecting roles.</p>
<p>In a first phase, Rekall was developed not only as a document management tool in a multimodal environment, but also as a video annotation software, with three complementary strategies: the creation of links between multiple documents offering the possibility of commenting and illuminating the documents between them; the choice of video recording as a backbone from which all other documents would be organized; and the possibility of adding textual comments. Subsequently, these two aspects were separated. The video annotation part about of Rekall has now become MemoRekall.</p>
<p>MemoRekall offers a reading of a major document: video recordings. The software is a user-friendly web application that explains a video by annotating it and linking it to external documents or web pages. The arrangement of documents, links and annotations creates a new document, called a  “capsule” , that can be embedded into a web page. The capsules organization is developed from and around video recordings in a hypertextual logic. MemoRekall can be used to create a multimedia educational booklet, run a digital spectator school, edit a scientific web documentary or simplify the distribution of works. MemoRekall is developed in HTML5 / CSS3 with a backend using PHP/MySQL technologies. The video player is developed in HTML5, allowing it to be integrated into the main web browsers (Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome). The personal user account was developed with the Symfony framework.</p>
<p>Rekall and MemoRekall are complementary platforms aimed at preserving and analysing the digital traces of the performing arts. They allow to organize and visualize in a multimodal environment all the traces of a creative processe (Rekall) or only a selection of the traces (MemoRekall), paying special attention to the video recording of the works (MemoRekall). With Rekall, it’s possible to retrace the historic of a file (but not the versioning, which can be done with complementary tools). In terms of research, Rekall and MemoRekall are platforms suited to genetic analysis, close and distant reading of a work, documentation and preservation of a performance.</p>

<p>In 2012, Guillaume Marais (ergonomics and interface design), Guillaume Jacquemin (IT development) and Thierry Coduys (consultant, designer of electronic devices for the performing arts) joined the project. They already had a first common experience of software development with IanniX, a real-time sequencer for digital art inspired by UPIC (a former project by Iannis Xenakis). Throughout his artistic career, which led him to IRCAM, Thierry Coduys has developed electroacoustic and computer devices for numerous directors, composers (including Luciano Berio, Ivan Fedele, and Pascal Dusapin) and choreographers. He was regularly confronted with the question of touring, restaging and transmitting works with particularly complex technological caracteristics. Guillaume Jacquemin and Guillaume Marais created the Buzzing Light agency in 2009. Guillaume Jacquemin is an embedded systems engineer and is trained through multiple experiences in interactive multimedia and digital art. Guillaume Marais is an ergonomist and interaction designer and is trained in information systems engineering. In addition to their complementary skills in programming and ergonomics, Guillaume Marais and Guillaume Jacquemin were used to contributing to artistic projects and had a keen appetite for contemporary music. It was an essential factor: to develop Rekall, it was crucial to establish a dialogue around the key issues of the software. We used an AGILE approach and progressed incrementally based on user feedback.</p>
<p>I am often asked why I have not chosen instead to work with a computer science research laboratory. There are several answers to this question. One is that I needed to be in a very operational, fluid and fast environment. Furthermore, it did not appear that the project raised computer research issues. In 2012, in France, a computer development project led by a theatre studies researcher was not always well accepted by the academic community. Finally, on one hand, the funding obtained came from funds for innovation in the field of culture (Pictanovo) and from cultural institutions.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  This gave great flexibility in hiring service providers. On the other hand, the lack of research funding and the administrative management of the project by a theatre (the Phénix scène nationale Valenciennes) and then, in 2015, by a publishing house (Subjectile) did not allow the hiring of a Ph.D. student or a postdoc. Today, with the development of the digital humanities and the resulting cultural change, the software development framework would probably be different. So indeed, the contribution of Thierry Coduys, Guillaume Jacquemin and Guillaume Marais were crucial. The results we obtained would have been very different with another team that wouldn’t have had any experience with artistic creative processes. For example, creating software that can be used by artists has several consequences. The main point is that it must be as easy to use as possible and still meet the rigorous requirements of researchers. This involved a reflection on interface design and ergonomics and two essential decisions. The first is that Rekall had to operate discreetly in the background on the assumption that artists have very little time to archive their work even if they are aware of its importance. The artistic team works on its usual tools while Rekall records in the background all the manipulations that are done as well as the users&rsquo; working environment (the version of their OS, the open applications, and their version) in order to collect all fundamental information from a preservation perspective. It is essential to keep the most exact trace possible of the technological components and of the aesthetic and historical dimensions. At the same time, it is important to describe the effects of these same components, in line with the variable media approach in order to make them evolve and update <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. The artistic team only opens the software when it needs to have an overview, annotate certain documents, or go back over the history of the files. The second decision is the lack of a specialized ontology. Past experiences show that these ontologies are difficult to apply by non-specialists and, to underline the point, they do not respond to all the situations encountered. The tool has to be as labile as possible and able to accommodate all types of artistic approaches. The only scheme used is the simplified Dublin Core scheme to describe the files (this scheme is expected to be implemented soon). In the same spirit, even if we are open to the possibility of importing thesauri to index the files, we initially favored folksonomy.</p>
<p>Once the team and the first funding were gathered, the keywords of our working method became collaboration, testing, and adaptation. During a first step, it took the form of face-to-face working meetings on a monthly basis, and then less frequently. The first exchanges were in the form of drawings and graphs. At the heart of our discussions were the issues mentioned above and to which we tried to provide concrete solutions in the form of usage scenarios. In other words, how were we to reconcile theory and practice? A state of the art study was carefully examined, in particular, the work initiated by William Forsythe and the research carried out at IRCAM, were discussed at length. Once the issues and objectives were clearly defined, a first development phase began, leading to a beta version at the end of 2013. There were many iterations, Guillaume Marais and Guillaume Jacquemin working together on the development and interface, Thierry Coduys and myself giving feedback. If I brought a researcher&rsquo;s point of view, Thierry Coduys brought the artistic team’s point of view.</p>
<p>We also associated two artistic teams to the project, in the theatre (Jean-François Peyret) and dance (Mylène Benoit) domains, in residence respectively at Le Fresnoy and Le Phénix scène nationale Valenciennes (France). There both were the initial partners of the project. On the one hand, we needed real data to work on a tangible case. This was made possible by the  <em>Re: Walden</em>  project mentioned above. On the other hand, I wanted to be involved in a creative process from the beginning to understand better how Rekall could fit in and what its contributions could be. Mylène Benoit opened the doors of the rehearsals of  <em>Notre Danse</em> , a choreography created in 2014. Many informal interviews with these artists and their teams have allowed us to clarify many aspects of Rekall. Finally, workshops, as well as public presentations (study days, conferences, talks), allowed us to confront different audiences (researchers, artists, technicians) and to fine-tune the project. A new use, which we had not considered, emerged: the possibility of using Rekall as a writing tool. This confirms the flexibility of the platform. Nonetheless, to consider all the implications of this new use would be a very important shift. At this stage of the project, we decided not to address it directly. We took the idea into account for MemoRekall and mentioned this possibility during workshops.</p>
<p>Several specialists were invited to share their feedback on Rekall during brainstorming sessions with the entire team. In particular, we met with: Alain Bonardi (musicologist and composer, Paris 8), Pierre Couprie (musicologist, Paris 4), Émeline Brulé (design researcher, ENSAD), Cécile Obligi (BnF) and Sébastien Peyrard (metadata standards, BnF), Frédéric Bevilacqua (IRCAM), Lev Manovich (CUNY), Annick Bureaud (Leonardo/Olats), Scott Delahunta (Motion Bank), amongst others. Listening to users so as not to develop a solution only for my personal use and to respond to as wide a range of uses as possible remains a constant concern, even today.</p>
<p>By working with others and listening, the development team were led to adapt the initial project. Rekall has known several versions - and we hope so, will know more. The first phase, from the end of 2012 to November 2013, was based on the case study of Jean-François Peyret&rsquo;s  <em>Re: Walden</em>  project. The Rekall team has been collecting documents, as well as those related to the different stages of the creative process since 2006. This made it possible to develop the data-visualization part of Rekall. Indeed, it quickly became apparent that the software had to offer two main uses: data visualization and a timeline. The data visualization interface presents the entire corpus in a multimodal environment and allows the user to play with different views from the extraction of metadata from the files. The timeline interface allows organizing a selection of documents on a time axis. One or more video recordings are used as the primary document to define the time axis. It is then possible to play several video streams in parallel, which allows for example to compare several rehearsals or a front and a zenithal view. Timeline mode uses only a small selection of documents. It is principally designed for document annotation purposes, to complement information that is not perceptible and intelligible through data visualization.</p>
<p>With Thierry Coduys, we tested an alpha version from November 2013. He focused on artistic uses, I studied related research issues. Another development phase on the timeline began in February 2014. In May 2014, a workshop at Le Fresnoy brought together developers, technicians, and artists to discuss the development. Many points were validated, notably on metadata processing and the general interface. Specific functionalities related to the documentation of the creation process were specified, some interface details were revised, and some functionalities simplified. This work allowed the beta version to be released online on June 13, 2014 (see Figure 1).</p>

<p>Following various tests, we decided to change the development methods and integrate an interface in HTML5 and CSS3 in order to anticipate the uses and development of an online version. This new development took place in the fall of 2014. The code was completely rewritten, and a V0 was published in November 2014. The user feedback and beta test on the V0 led us to refine and simplify the interface and the various functionalities, with a clear separation between data visualization and timeline. A V1 of the prototype was available at the end of 2015 (see Figure 2).</p>

<p>The initial version of Rekall was aimed at a professional audience. Nevertheless, a demand for the general public and schoolchildren quickly appeared. The school partners of the Phénix scène nationale Valenciennes wanted to have access to the content created with Rekall on a website available to students. They also wanted students to be able to document the works themselves collaboratively and directly, either from documents provided by the theatres and artistic teams hosted or from documents created by the students themselves. At the same time, a team of young writers contacted us. They wanted to renew theater criticism by having a collaborative writing tool that could be superimposed on a video recording available and broadcasted on the Internet.</p>
<p>This is why we started to develop MemoRekall at the end of 2014, with funding from the French Ministry of Culture and other cultural institutions that joined the project. All the work done on the timeline part of Rekall was used and simplified to the utmost. While Rekall remains for the moment a standalone software, MemoRekall is designed from the beginning as a web application accessible from a browser (see Figure 3). In order to validate the software design, various workshops and training sessions were organized in September 2015 with middle school and high school students, higher education students, teachers and cultural professionals (more than 100 people participated in this phase of the project). Edwige Perrot, a theater researcher and a teacher, joined the team to create capsules and lead the workshops for school pupils. MemoRekall was made available to the public at the end of September 2015. The web application has allowed us to solve codec problems that were not solved with Rekall. We decided to release a Version 2 of the prototype in 2017 without the timeline interface. Rekall now focused on the data visualization part and processed a more significant number of documents simultaneously (about 6,000). This first scaling up must be continued as it is not rare to gather more than 10 000 documents for one work as we have seen with  <em>Re: Walden</em> . Also in 2017, Estelle Senay, network engineer, joined the team. A personal user account to MemoRekall was added and a new website was deployed at the end of the year. In 2018 the usage scenarios were fine tuned and training provided for MemoRekall. If the web application is taken as an operational tool, Rekall is still at the advanced prototype stage. A search for funding is underway to scale up the system. Many features remain to be developed. For example, the performing arts involve collaborative teams, it would therefore be useful to have different people working together on a same Rekall project. At this stage, Rekall allows a collaborative collection of the traces but lends itself to an individual analysis of these traces. This necessitates that collaborative tools be developed further for Rekall.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-outlook">Conclusion: Outlook</h2>
<p>The preservation of the performing arts in the digital age does not call for a univocal solution but for a complementarity of strategies: diachronic documentation of works based on documentation that is as rigorous as it is precise, preserving a historical and material anchorage; inter and intra-documentary annotation of video recording, this trace that is now omnipresent; circulation between different reading distances. The complex nature of performing arts makes it irreducible to a single approach; any attempt at documentation is characterized by its incompleteness. What these different strategies have in common is the redocumentarisation of traces. Each time a reader consults, links or extracts data from digital traces, it re-documents them. Re-playing,  “re-enacting”  a performance is necessarily today to go through a performative act carried out within the digital traces. This performativity is synonymous with instrumentation. We have thus proposed two complementary tools, Rekall and MemoRekall, which could be used in wider fields such as time based media art preservation, digital art history or electronic publishing.</p>
<p>The reception of Rekall and MemoRekall is enthusiastic. As soon as it appeared in 2015, theatres and classes seized MemoRekall for their activities. Today, more than 1 500 capsules have been produced. Since its first version in 2014, Rekall has been downloaded several thousand times. The whole project has given rise to numerous articles, talks, and workshops, in France and abroad. There are many development opportunities, and new functionalities must be implemented to get as close as possible to an answer to the questions raised by the digital traces of the performing arts. Moreover, if the project was initially designed for the performing arts, its scope may cover other artistic practices.</p>
<p>The development of this project, based in a specific field and in the French context, leads to several reflections. On the one hand, Rekall changes the genetic studies of the performing arts. It is now possible to take into account all the digital traces of a creation process in a multimodal environment. Retreiving metadata with Rekall allows distant reading and at the same time while a keeping a link to the original file. It also allows close reading of the most important documents identified through distant reading. For researchers of the performing arts this provides a new way to circulate between micro and macro dimensions of a corpora. On the other hand, MemoRekall provides for researchers a new publishing tool, articulating video-recording, documents (archives or documents created by the researcher) and annotations, and allows co-editing. The connection and complementarity between Rekall and MemoRekall is a project in its own right, but certain bricks have already been laid (common development core, compatible interfaces). Indeed, we are seeking to reconcile two approaches often considered to be opposed in digital history and the treatment of digital traces. The first one shows the sources and superimposes different strata to make them explicit. We find here the question of annotation and a critical work specific to the humanities. This approach is anchored in a practice of editorialization. The second approach extracts data sources and proposes to analyse them by applying different computational methods. This approach is based on the école des annales and the quantitative approach.</p>
<p>The question of the sustainability of digital technology is not only a technological issue. It is also an institutional and cultural issue. For Rekall and MemoRekall, this would mean finding a framework that allows for the maintenance, development, and hosting of open source and free software solutions. It is not the role of cultural institutions that financed the project to put this responsibility on a small team made up, by in large, of self-employed workers in, invarariably, precarious economic situations. MemoRekall is now hosted by Huma-num (a French Very Large Research Infrastructure - Très Grande Infrastructure de Recherche, TGIR) that provides long term preservation of the capsules created with the web-application.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of philosophy and theology, it is my opinion that the proposed work would have no utility commensurate with the tremendous mechanical labor it would involve. While an Index of technically philosophical and theological terms occurring in the  <em>Opera Omnia</em>  of St. Thomas would be very useful, the extension of the work to include  <em>all</em>  words in St. Thomas’ works (including, I presume, conjunctions, prepositions, etc.) seems to me : — 1) of no great utility; 2) a sort of fetish of scholarship gone wild, and 3) a drift in the direction of pure mechanical verbalism which would tend to deaden rather than revivify the thought of St. Thomas. (I think he himself would have been horrified at the thought!)<br>

<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>Early in 1950, Daniel L. McGloin, the Chair of Philosophy at Loyola University of Los Angeles (now Loyola Marymount) wrote a letter critical of the idea of the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  project that Father Busa had been promoting in order to get support. We know from the correspondence preserved in the Busa Archive that Busa had sent out letters describing the project and soliciting letters of support. While most correspondents did write supportive letters, at least one did not. McGloin’s review of the project was for his Rector who enclosed it in his note back to Busa. The project was, according to McGloin,  “a sort of fetish of scholarship gone wild” . It was the one negative response we have on record and it is clear that McGloin was appalled.</p>
<p>What exactly bothered McGloin so much? What can we learn from the criticism of what is arguably the first digital humanities project? In what could be the first instance of a long tradition of pointing out the dark side of automation in the humanities, McGloin the philosopher was horrified by what he perceived to be the  “mechanical verbalism which would tend to deaden rather than revivify the thought of St. Thomas.”  He could see the value of a concordance of philosophical and theological terms, but not of  <em>all</em>  words. He thought this was  “of no great utility” , especially considering the  “tremendous mechanical labor it would involve.” <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  In criticizing Busa’s project he played with a contrast between the living (and the labor that revivifies thought) against the mechanical (and the mindless work that deadens).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  In doing so he alerts us to a tension in how digital methods change the actual work of the humanist: who does the work and how technologies are woven into our practices.</p>
<p>This paper sets out to understand that tension by revisiting the mechanical labor of Busa’s project, or more precisely, by trying to replicate exactly how automation was developed for concording Aquinas. Replication here is a praxis of media archaeology that can help us understand the context of a technology as understood in its time <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> by trying to imitate what was done. Needless to say, to understand the mechanical labor we also have to touch on the human labor and how humans were integrated, though the human labor is not our primary focus here.</p>
<p>From the comfortable distance of more than half a century later, living as we do in an epoch defined by language engineering companies like Alphabet (Google), we can say that Busa and his IBM-based collaborator Tasman proved to be prescient, despite McGloin’s complaints. No one today would question the usefulness of the tremendous language processing techniques that are currently used, and that is part of what makes it harder to understand the work that went into actually developing ways for processing textual data back then. What were the mechanical processes? What was the data processed and what processing techniques allowed Busa and Tasman to generate a  “First example of word indexes automatically compiled and printed by IBM punched card machines”  (the subtitle of Busa’s  <em>Varia Specima</em> )? Further, how was what we today would call an algorithm for language processing conceived? For better or worse, these techniques initiated a new era of mechanical and eventually computer-assisted language engineering. It is therefore worth recovering an understanding of what was achieved, and we will do that in four moves.</p>
<p>First, we will briefly discuss the historiography around Busa’s project. What resources do we have access to if we want to understand the techniques developed then? Where and how did he discuss this project?  Second, we will focus on the punched card data format that they developed. How was text chosen and encoded for this project?  Third, we will look at the key tokenizing process that produced word cards from phrases. We hope to convince readers that this was a significant innovation for its time.  Fourth and finally, we will return to McGloin’s concerns around deadening labor.</p>
<h2 id="historiography-of-a-project">Historiography of a Project</h2>
<p>If projects are central to digital humanities practice <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, then we must recognize that we have largely neglected that aspect in the considerable literature on digital humanities as a discipline, and it is time to ask how we can study projects. Concretely, for Busa’s project, a first step would be to do a historiography of the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  project and the host of the project, the GIRCSE<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  centre. To understand ourselves in our paradigmatic project practices we need to ask how one studies projects and labs when their scholarly outputs tend to hide (deliberately or otherwise) their labor and infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the case of GIRCSE and the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  we are unusually fortunate to have four types of resources in addition to the set of publications where Busa and Tasman explicitly discuss their methods. First, we have the extensive Busa Archive at the Library of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan (Biblioteca dell&rsquo;Università Cattolica). Busa’s team organized and kept an extraordinary record of unpublished documents related to the project, from sales correspondence to every one of Busa’s publications.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  These are now being catalogued by the Library of the Catholic University. Some of the key documents from the Archive include letters like the one from McGloin and others where Busa described his method in different contexts. There are also sample punched cards; a  “Flow Chart” ; photographs, including some of the people at work on the project on the ex-factory floor; and a project proposal.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>A second type of important resource is secondary sources like Steven Jones’ book  <em>Roberto Busa, S. J., And the Emergence of Humanities Computing: The Priest and the Punched Cards</em>  (2016). Books like this provide background context including many of the resources, key events, and cultural contexts.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  It is also the best guide into understanding the origins of the project. Another valuable work is Winter’s article  “Roberto Busa, S.J., and the Invention of the Machine-Generated Concordance”  (1999) which defends the claim that Busa was the first to automate concording.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there are oral testimonies by those who worked on the project or knew of it and related materials. Julianne Nyhan and Melissa Terras have been gathering information about the women who worked on the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  project.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  Nyhan traveled to Italy and interviewed many of the women operators; she has a book forthcoming on  <em>Uncovering  hidden  contributions to the history of Digital Humanities: the Index Thomisticus’ female keypunch operators.</em></p>
<p>Finally, there are the publications by the project leaders like Busa and Tasman describing the methods they were developing. Julianne Nyhan and Marco Passarotti are putting together an edited and translated collection of some of Busa’s key papers which will make it much easier to study Busa’s published thought. The key publications used in this paper are, in chronological order:</p>
<p>The  <em>Varia Specima Concordantium</em>  from 1951 which is a concordance of the poetry of St. Thomas Aquinas that was the  “First example of word indexes automatically compiled and printed by IBM punched card machines,”  as the subtitle put it. This publication was the proof-of-concept project for the much larger  <em>Index</em>  and it was the first fruit of the support from IBM for the  <em>Index.</em>  It has a bilingual Introduction (English and Italian) that describes their innovating process.  Tasman’s 1957 article in an IBM trade journal on  “Literary Data Processing.”   Busa’s chapter from 1958 on  “The Use of Punched Cards in Linguistic Analysis”  in a larger collection on  <em>Punched Cards.</em>   Busa’s project proposal from 1962 to IBM for completing the  <em>Index</em>  in time to show it at the New York World’s Fair in 1964,  “Per Completare Lo Index Thomisticus Per L’Esposizione Mondiale Di New York 1964 – 1965”  (For Completing the Index Thomisticus For the New York World’s Fair 1964-1965).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>In all of these there is a summary of the technical process they developed, a clear indication of their awareness of the importance of the developing process at the time. In the introduction of  <em>Varia Specima</em>  Busa summarizes this process as five stages and this summary is worth quoting as a description of a workflow of the labor involved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I bring down to five stages the most material part of compiling a concordance:<br>
transcription of the text, broken down into phrases<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> , on to separate cards;  multiplication of the cards (as many as there are words on each);  indicating on each card the respective entry (lemma);  the selection and placing in alphabetical order of all the cards according to the lemma and its purely material quality;  finally, once that formal elaboration of the alphabetical order of the words which only an expert&rsquo;s intelligence can perform, has been done, the typographical composition of the pages to be published. (p. 20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say that the IBM system could “carry out all the material part of the work” of steps 2, 3, 4, and 5, though he also talks (p. 26) about the need to have a philologist intervene at stage 3 to disambiguate and lemmatize words. In Paul Tasman’s  “Literary Data Processing”  (1957) the stages outlined are different. Instead of one step for  “transcription of text”  he has two steps, that of the scholar who marks up the text and that of the keypunch operator who copies it onto cards. This more clearly separates the scholarly from the data entry work.<br>
The scholar analyzes the text, marking it with precise instructions for card punching.  A clerk copies the text using a special typewriter which operates a card punch. This typewriter has a keyboard similar to that of a conventional typewriter and produces the phrase cards. (p. 254)</p>
<p>In “The Use of Punched Cards” Busa describes yet another process. Here is the flow chart that Busa provides in  “The Use of Punched Cards”  (1958, 359). It focuses on who is doing the work:<br>

</figure></p>
<p>In this flow chart from 1958 we again have two operations at the start – that of the scholar marking the original text and that of the entry of the phrases by a key-punch operator. What is new is that the last two stages of 1951 are represented by one operation in 1958, but it is clear that the one box covers many processes for different types of indexes.</p>
<p>One thing that stands out in this process, especially when one looks at other materials like the photographs of the space where the work was done, is how many people were needed for what we today think of as an automated process. The machines may have done some of the tedious work, but it took human labor to prepare texts for data entry, then there was the data entry itself, there was programming, there was the moving of stacks of cards from machine to machine, and then were all the management tasks. The 1962 project proposal gives a break down of the staff needed, admittedly for an accelerated completion. The number of staff proposed, divided by department is listed as:<br>
Machine Department: 33 staff (likely to be mostly women operators)  Research Department: 21 staff  Programming Department: 7 staff  Management and Services: 9 staff</p>
<p>This is a total of 70 staff for a project that was supposed to be showing the advantages of automation! What also stands out is the gendering of the departments. The operators of the Machine Department, which was the largest proposed unit, were mostly women. As Terras points out in her Ada Lovelace day blog post (2013), it was women who actually ran the machines and they are often shown in the photographs demonstrating the computing to men.</p>
<p>Returning to the processes that were automated — and looking at the details of the descriptions Busa and Tasman give us — two key innovations stand out that made linguistic data processing possible.<br>
First, they developed a way of representing a text fully so that it could be processed by machines, and  Second, they developed a process for tokenizing the text — generating words cards with the electro-mechanical machines of the day.</p>
<p>These innovations changed the integration of people and technologies that went into concording, and for that matter, changed how data was processed (previously cards had been used for structured data such as census information, but not for unstructured linguistic data). It seems obvious now, but these innovative uses of machines made possible a different organization of people and technology where data entry was separated from programming which was separated from the scholarly work. Technologies, as philosophers Ihde (1998) and Winner (1980) remind us, are not neutral tools. McGloin may have intuited how Busa’s project would still call for tremendous human labor despite the machines and that much of that labor would be mechanical for the women involved.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>In sum, Busa’s team conceived a new way to break down the work of concording by first figuring out how to represent text as data that could be processed by machine and then figuring out how to process that data into tokens (words) that could then be manipulated to generate various types of indexes. In these two connected innovations they essentially developed literary data processing, no small feat at the time.</p>
<p>The next two parts of this paper will look at these two stages and discuss the replication of what they might have actually done as a way of probing our understanding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a story from early in the technological revolution, when the application was out searching for the hardware, from a time before the Internet, a time before the PC, before the chip, before the mainframe. From a time even before programming itself. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="punched-cards">Punched Cards</h2>
<p>From today’s perspective it is hard to appreciate how different the  <em>data</em>  of  “data processing”  was in those early years. Busa could not go onto the internet or scan the texts he needed. All input had to be punched by hand — there was no  “data” , nothing given. There weren’t any standard ways of representing texts for data processing and punched cards were limiting. He wasn’t even using what would today be considered a digital computer. The  <em>Varia Specima</em>  project (1951) which demonstrated the concept used electro-mechanical machines to sort, replicate, and print on cards. This was a liminal moment between mechanical data processing instruments with pre-defined functions and digital, programmable computers with punched cards in common as a way to enter, store, and record data and results.</p>
<p>The one technology that had been at least partially standardized was the punched card as a way of entering and storing data. The punched card, despite later discussion about folding, spindling, or mutilating, was a robust way of entering information so that it could be processed manually  <em>and</em>  by computers.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  As a data technology it goes back to the Jacquard loom and is still used today, such as in some voting machines like those used in Florida in the 2000 presidential election between Bush and Gore.</p>
<p>The Busa project used the IBM card format. This had been developed in 1928 and had become a de facto standard. Each card was 7⅜ inches wide by 3¼ inches tall. They were made of stiff paper with a notch in the upper left for orientation. The arrangement of holes was standardized so that all relevant machines could process them. Given the size, the IBM card could fit 80 columns and 12 rows of punch locations. While the dimensions and punch zones were standardized, projects could overprint with ink whatever they wanted on the cards as what was printed wouldn’t affect the data processing; printing was intended for human processing, not machine processing.<br>

<p>It is also worth noting that Busa’s project was large and different enough that they had their own non-standard cards, including some with bubbles for manual pencil marks. Figure 2 shows an example card from the Busa Archive with the areas and labels related to  “Philological Analysis.”  These printed zones could have been used by scholars to manually add annotations as needed for human sorting as part of hybrid machine/human processing. Or they could have been used for easily reading the punched data. Either way, it was common for punched cards in those days to have to be handled by both humans and by machines <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. The  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  project was no different; there would have been a tremendous amount of human labor associated with handling the stacks of cards. The human labor would have gone into preparing cards, moving them, checking them, annotating them and even hand sorting them. It would be interesting to try to recreate the flow of Busa’s hybrid processes, but that is for another project.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><br>

To return to understanding what Busa may have done in the way of digitally representing textual data we have tried to virtually replicate the data dimension of his punch cards with a simple interactive punch card that shows you what holes would be punched in order to represent the data you want the card to bear (see below). This is set up with our best guess of the card data format they used — feel free to enter examples and see if you get what you expected. We have here used replication as a way of thinking through the history of computing. In the replication of a technology we can discover aspects of the technology that wouldn’t occur when just documenting it and others can test our hypothesis as to how data was encoded. Among other things the punched card interactive helped us better understand how this encoding system was actually a curious blend of a decimal-based system (0 to 9 with a couple of extra control rows) and the more binary-based digital processing (0 or 1). A typical punched card had 12 rows to represent any one character, which in fact is potentially very high resolution (12-bit = 4096 possibilities), whereas the first character sets for computers were at most 4, 5 or 6-bit (64 possibilities).</p>
<p>In this case we were forced to figure out exactly which IBM format was used. Emulating the cards raises the issue of  <em>what</em>  data Busa could encode and  <em>how</em>  it was encoded on cards. Our best guess, looking at example cards in the Archive, and reading descriptions, is that they used something like the 48-character BCDIC (Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code). We know that by the early 1930s there was a 40-character BCDIC format that combined more than one hole per column to provide 40 characters (Space, 0-9, A-Z and a couple of special characters.) By the late 1950s BCDIC had been extended and the IBM chain printers were capable of printing 47 graphics (characters) along with a space to make the 48-character BCDIC with 11 special characters, namely: .&rsquo;$,#%-&amp;*/ ¤ . Keypunch equipment was also becoming available so users that could input any of these characters with one key stroke, as opposed to having the operator select the punch hole combinations for each character <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. From the Tasman article we know that the project used at least /, #, ‘, and ¤. <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> which is why our guess is that the project was using something close to 48-character BCDIC.<br>

</figure></p>
<p>It is worth noting however, that they did not need to adhere to any particular standard the way we need to today. There was no operating system or off-the-shelf software enforcing standards. There were no other projects that might use their data. The only issue was what the keypunch could enter, what could be read, and what the printers could print, if printing was needed. At that time you could extend things and program the machines to operate on your own hole combinations. It could very well be that the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  project provided some of the impetus behind the extension to 48 character BCDIC as it would have been a major project defining IBM’s move into linguistic engineering.</p>
<p>Having explored some of the  <em>how</em>  of Busa’s work with punched cards, we will now turn to the  <em>what</em>  or purpose of the work, because that is where Tasman and Busa figured out a practical way to adapt the technology at hand to text processing. The key was realizing that they only needed two sets of cards for most literary/linguistic operations: a set of Sentence (or Phrase) Cards making up the whole text, with associated information, and a set of Each Word Cards (EWC) with all the words (tokens) and associated information. In today’s terms they needed only two database tables to generate the various forms of indexes they wanted; one was the full text, the second was a word index. In the processing they showed that you can go from one to the other using the one best suited for the analytic process. This is the precursor of analytical tools that cache a word index in addition to the text for efficiency purposes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each phrase is preceded by the reference to the place where this line is found and provided with a serial number and a special reference sign. <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was actually held on the two types of cards? The sentence or phrase cards held the location/reference in the original text, the text of the phrase, a number for the phrase (serial number) and a special reference mark to indicate if the phrase was thought to be by St. Aquinas himself or a reference to words by another. The amount of text for each card, given the limitations of 80 columns (not counting the columns reserved for reference data), would be decided by the scholar who divided the text up into logical thoughts and then into meaningful phrases that would fit on a card. It is important to note that human intervention was needed to fit the ongoing unstructured text onto 80-column cards.</p>
<p>The EWCs had less text and more associated information. By the time of Tasman’s article, each word card would have encoded in the punched holes the following (some fields are further explained below):<br>
A reference to the phrase card (and hence phrase location),  A special reference mark,  The word itself as it appears in the text,  A number (order) of the word in the text,  The first letter of the preceding word,  The first letter of the following word,  A Form Card number (alphabetical sequence), and  An Entry Card number.</p>
<p>The Form Cards were the headings for each different word. The Entry cards were the entry headings that presumably would appear in the final printed concordance for the different word types after lemmatization and disambiguation ( <em>dance</em>  as a verb or as a noun would have different entries, for instance). These were created by a second intervention by scholars and would be the entries in any published concordance. In Figure 4 you can see where in the flow chart the Different Word Cards (or Form Cards) are generated along with the summaries and lists that allow the Scholar to write a list of Entry Words.<br>

<p>There are a few noteworthy aspects about the project’s use of punched cards. First, data on cards was material in the sense that users could physically touch the carrier of the data — the punched card. Many of the processes from keypunching to sorting involved physically manipulating the cards themselves, not data in memory. The human was also part of the sequence of operations as someone would have to load cards, move stacks from machine to machine, and cards would actually be consulted by humans at certain points. Busa would have been aware that he was setting up a system that integrated people and machines in new configurations, at least for the humanities.<br>

<p>Busa and Tasman made full use of the materiality of the punched card. They actually had at least three orders of information on the cards. There was what we are going to call the data proper that was punched on the card and could be operated on mechanically. Then they would print (not punch) extra information on the front or back of the cards for human consultation. For example, they would print the data punched on the top of the fronts of the cards so that they could be checked by eye, or they could print up to 9 lines (phrases) of context on the backs of EWCs so a scholar could easily check the context when lemmatizing without having to call up the phrase card. Finally, they had an area on the left of cards that would take lead pencil marks so scholars could mark cards for additional processing.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  In Tasman’s (1957) article we see that both the Sentence Cards and EWCs had such areas.</p>
<p>One way to appreciate the difference between data then and now is to reflect on how the project was not about using computers or software as we understand them now. The actual work involved punching information onto cards, proofing of cards, using electromechanical machines to process the cards, creating new cards, printing things on cards, moving cards from machine to machine, duplicating them, and marking them for further processing. The  “programming”  in this context was the design of the cards so that various sorting, replicating and counting processes produce what was needed. (It was also the wiring/configuring of the machines.) The cards enabled and constrained what could be done. The work of the project as described by Tasman was really the work of managing punched cards as tokens to be interpreted. The cards were a surrogate for the text that could be processed to produce a new concorded text.</p>
<h2 id="processing">Processing</h2>
<p>Now to the second innovation of Busa and Tasman and that is the algorithmic one. It is fascinating to reconstruct the mechanical processes with which all this information could be generated and added to the cards in successive passes with a limited number of standard machines. For example, to add the first letter of each following card the stack of EWCs would be sorted in reverse order of appearance and then run through starting with the last word. The first character of each word would then be carried forward (or backward in this case) and written out on the next card, which illustrates another property of the material cards, the fact that data can be incrementally added to the blank areas with proper planning. We do not have space here to go through all the succession of processes. Instead, we will focus on the one process that made literary data processing possible, and that is the tokenizing of the Sentence Cards to generate Each Word Cards (EWCs). This is the crucial innovation that showed how systems designed for accounting could be used for unstructured text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is equivalent to state that each line was multiplied as many times as words it contained. I must confess that in actual practice this was not so simple as I endeavoured to make it in the description; the second and the successive words did not actually commence in the same column on all cards. In fact, it was this lack of determined fields which constituted the greatest hindrance in transposing the system from the commercial and statistical uses to the sorting of words from a literary text. The result was attained by exploring the cards, column by column, in order to identify by the non-punched columns the end of the previous word and the commencement of the following one; thus, operating with the sorter and reproducer together, were produced only those words commencing and finishing in the same columns. <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup><br>
This would have been considered difficult at the time. As Busa writes in 1951, the existing commercial accounting and statistical uses of punched cards assumed that there would be zones on the card that constituted predictable fields. These fields could hold alphabetic information like names in a personnel dataset, but the start of each name – the zone of the card where it appeared - would be known in advance, allowing processing operations to be easily set up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By contrast, with a phrase of unstructured text only the first word on each card is in a predictable place and even then there is no information about where the field ends. Thus the problem they had to solve was how to explore the Sentence Cards over and over, identifying each successive word … and in 1951 they had to do this using only sorting machines with replicators to create the new EWCs. This was the key mechanical process that allowed one type of data — phrase cards – to be processed to generate another — word cards. Everything else could in theory then be generated using these two sets of cards (along with a bit of human work lemmatizing/disambiguating.)</p>
<p>To figure out how this could be done we have again replicated the process, though in code rather than with an emulated machine.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  We imagined that one would start by exploring all the cards, sorting out those with a space in the second column. Those would be the cards with a one letter word at the start. These would be run through the replicator which would now know what zone the word to find was in and thus could create an EWC for the one letter word. Then one would sort the remaining cards to find those with a space in the third position and so on until one had explored every possible location of a word between two spaces. We suspect that this actually would have involved a lot of physical moving of stacks and also keeping track of the subsets of cards – not an entirely mechanical process, but one less prone to error and much faster than writing things out by hand. Tremendous semi-mechanical labor indeed.</p>
<p>Later they found other ways to do this. By 1958 Busa had actually developed three ways to do this crucial process. In  “The Use of Punch Cards”  (1958) Busa describes the 3 options (on page 361) as:<br>
The keypunch operator could just punch individual word cards (whether in addition or instead of phrase cards.) Punching just the EWCs was the most efficient way if all you need was a word index.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>   The keypunch operator could punch the Sentence Cards and then, using sorting and replicating machines, the EWCs could be machine generated. This is the approach described in the  <em>Varia Specima</em>  quoted above.  Or a last process  “using the Cardatype, recently developed by IBM”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. This is the process that is diagramed in the 1952  “Flow Chart”  prepared by PT and JEG, probably Paul Tasman and an unidentified draftsman. Figure 5 shows the relevant detail of the flow chart where Sentence Cards are handled by the Cardatype:</p>

<p>The Cardatype was a modular and multi-function machine which makes it hard to figure out exactly what they did with it. It had one or more IBM electric typewriters, a verifier, and could have a tape-punching unit attached that would output a paper tape which could then control a card punch that would punch the EWCs <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> There seems to have been enough intelligence in the Cardatype to output to paper tape the data needed to punch the EWCs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>To conclude we begin by noting that Busa provided answers, of sorts, to McGloin’s criticism. Father Busa in his 1980 reflection on the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  defended the concording of function words by arguing that  “all functional or grammatical worlds … manifest the deepest logic of being which generates the basic structures of human discourse. It is this basic logic that allows the transfer from what the words mean today to what they meant to the writer”   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. The paradigmatic example for Busa was the one he used to open his 1980 article: understanding  <em>presence</em>  through prepositions like  <em>in</em>  as he tried to do in his doctoral thesis. Busa the philologist valued all the language of Aquinas as a way of understanding the historical context. McGloin wanted to focus on the philosophy and theology which he felt needed to be brought to life and made relevant to the modern world. This is an old tension in the humanities <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. McGloin may not have objected to the concording of function words  <em>per se</em> ; rather it was amount of work that he expected to be tremendous and useless. One wonders if Busa could have convinced him of the philosophical value of concording prepositions like  <em>in</em> ? That would not, however answer McGloin’s concern about the amount work required. As mentioned, McGloin probably (and rightly) inferred that the tremendous mechanical work would also mean tremendous human labor to set it all up and then deal with the results. And it should be noted that the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  project did involve an extensive human crew working in a converted factory space for decades <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. McGloin probably suspected that Busa was proposing a concording assembly line that would not be philosophically rewarding work but mechanical work that could have been better dedicated to something else.</p>
<p>A different sort of answer can be found in an article by Paul Tasman, Busa’s IBM engineering collaborator. He believed that innovations like the machine-searching application developed by the project  “may initiate a new era of language engineering.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The indexing and coding techniques developed by this method offer a comparatively fast method of literature searching, and it appears that the machine-searching application may initiate a new era of language engineering. It should certainly lead to improved and more sophisticated techniques for use in libraries, chemical documentation, and abstract preparation, as well as in literary analysis. <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tasman saw the business potential for IBM in the innovations of the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em> . While Thomas J. Watson Sr. (the CEO of IBM) may have been skeptical of the project when he first met Father Busa <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>, he ended up supporting it and it paid off in terms of innovation. In this Tasman was right. The language engineering innovations of the project underlie the digital turn of our age where not just language, but multiple media are either born digital or digitized for engineering on the computer. The computer has become the universal machine for processing information in any form. The project was the first step away from using the computer solely for numbers and towards using it for other forms of information. It should also be noted that IBM took advantage of the publicity that the Busa project offered, including it as part of their display at the 1964 New York World’s Fair (see <sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Having a sense of some of the tremendous mechanical labor involved in Busa’s project, something McGloin didn’t really have when commenting, we can conclude by asking again if such labor was worth it. Obviously, from an efficiency point of view, it was worth it if you grant that Busa was right about the value of a full concordance. Tasman <sup id="fnref3:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> estimated that mechanizing concordancing would reduce the time needed for the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  to a tenth of what a manual process would take, with a fifth of the people. One could also argue, as Tasman does, that Busa’s project not only produced a concordance but also developed innovative ways of ways of using the technologies at hand for  “language engineering.”  These developments we now know led to much more than concordances. They led to a whole alphabet of services. But, to be fair to McGloin, he was only reviewing the usefulness of the  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  for studying Aquinas, not reviewing the potential of the technology. McGloin argued that focusing on the technology would become a fetish of its own, distracting us from the interpretation of Aquinas, and he was right. But, would such tremendous labor not make it easier for others to interpret Aquinas? To claim that some words are more important and therefore more worthy of indexing for research seems to betray a limited imagination of what research could be. McGloin’s view, in retrospect, is conservative when it comes to imagining research usefulness but prescient if he meant to also alert us to reconfigurations of labor and machines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big Data has emerged a system of knowledge that is already changing the objects of knowledge, while also having the power to inform how we understand human networks and community<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McGloin was right to focus on labor and the changes in attention, what he calls fetish, though we disagree with his unquestioned association of mechanism with a loss of life. Changes in the labor of research change the object of research and the methods with which we think-through (and vice versa). Busa and Tasman were aware of this in that they discussed some of the implications of the new methods they were developing and could see some of the possibilities for different types of research and answers. McGloin is right to ask about these changes, but wrong to assume there is something necessarily dead about mechanised methods while the existing objects and methods are sacred. McGloin poses the critical question about what and how we are interpreting, but he is a romantic who does not question his own practices. As boyd and Crawford argue for big data (2012)  “it is time to start critically interrogating this phenomenon, its assumptions, and its biases”  (665). We would add that to critically interrogate a new phenomenon one needs to also ask about that with which it was contrasted in its time and also ask about the metaphors of contrast. One of the best ways to interrogate such a phenomenon of literary and linguistic computing is to do the archaeology of the technologies that actually changed the labor, objectives and methods, and that is what we have tried to do here. Much can be brought to life in the replication of liminal moments like Busa’s  <em>Index Thomisticus</em>  project.</p>
<p>Following boyd and Crawford, an aspect of the labor that McGloin might have objected to if he had had more time would have been the factory-like management systems developed for this big data project and the ways they might change what is considered knowledge in the humanities. Busa and Tasman didn’t just develop new technologies, they had to develop a physical center where the work could take place and an organization capable of carrying out so much human and mechanical labor. This wasn’t the first large scale humanities project, there had been large projects for some time, including concording projects, dictionary projects, archaeological projects, and editorial projects. It was, however, one of the first projects to integrate information technology and human labor so closely. The project needed deliberate planning, fund raising, management, public relations, and training in the use of computers. Jones (2016) has gone a long way towards documenting how this was the first humanities computing project. Nyhan and Terras have documented the gendered division of labor between male scholars and female punch card operators.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  Jones leads a web project  “Reconstructing the First Humanities Computing Center”  to which many have contributed that is reconstructing the physical space in Gallarate of the Centro per L’Automazione dell’Analisi Letteraria (Center for the Automation of Literary Analysis) or CAAL.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  Rockwell and Passarotti (2019) have looked at the project as a project.</p>
<p>From today’s perspective McGloin might have commented on how the challenge of dealing with so much text led to the development of a new organizational model for humanities projects where the integration of technology forced a new division of labor on the humans. It forced humanists to develop practices which integrated scholars with punch card operators, technical staff and engineers. We are still struggling with issues of credit and project management around these new configurations. These new configurations change the communities of knowledge and may have also changed the way knowledge is conceived. Information, often in the form of large amounts of data, has become synonymous with knowledge. The datafication of the cultural record has changed our thinking about knowledge. Scholarship has given way to information management.</p>

In this he complained about the technological materialism guiding life at the end of the war.  “Unconsciously, we have come to view life after the analogy of an assembly-line.

The punched card, despite later discussion about folding, spindling, or mutilating, was a robust way of entering information so that it could be processed manually and by computers. As a data technology it goes back to the Jacquard loom and is still used today, such as in some voting machines like those used in Florida in the 2000 presidential election between Bush and Gore.&#160;<a href="#fnref:16" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It kind of starts off with a historical perspective. That is that people from different domains don’t understand each other. There is quite a wall. Because when you have been studying a topic from a paradigm of your discipline for a long time, and others are dealing with similar things but in a totally different way, then there are certain blockages between them. And there has always been a curiosity to be the trader between those different domains. I think what we are doing here is to explore the digital tools to build bridges. [&hellip;] [However] people are not willing to come out of their comfort zone often.<br>
(interview, PhD 3, digital archaeologist) With these words, a PhD student described the ambitions but also the challenges of the Doctoral Training Unit (DTU)  “Digital History and Hermeneutics” : a four-year interdisciplinary research and training programme that was established at the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH) of the University of Luxembourg in March 2017. The DTU aims to provide an experimental space, in which different communities of practice and their epistemic cultures negotiate new forms of knowledge production and dissemination in the field of digital history.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  The programme involves thirteen PhD students with different disciplinary backgrounds, varying from history, philosophy, linguistics, geography, archaeology, computer science and human-computer interaction. One of the central aims of the DTU as such is to form a trading zone, a space for interactions and negotiations between these different knowledge domains, in order to explore how the emergence of digital research technologies and infrastructures has impacted the practices of doing historical research.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="11-research-questions-and-argument">1.1 Research questions and argument</h2>
<p>While the digital has increasingly provided a common ground between the humanities and the computer sciences during the last decades, this is not to say that connections are easily made – as the opening citation of this article indicates well. Using the case study of the DTU, we aim at discussing a number of critical questions that resonate with the topic of this special issue: How to build bridges between different knowledge domains in a specific research environment? How to stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration and to get scholars out of their disciplinary or methodological comfort zones? What is at stake in such interdisciplinary trading zones? Who are the traders – and what is being traded? Investigating these questions is not only relevant for the field of digital history, but for the wider domain of digital humanities at large: many DH research projects involve collaboration across different disciplinary fields and domains. While much theoretical work is being done on interdisciplinarity in digital humanities (e.g. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>), the questions of how to constitute an interdisciplinary trading zone in practice and how to situate this trading zone in physical working environments remain largely underexplored.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the DTU as a case study of an interdisciplinary trading zone and its situated research practices in digital history, the field that engages with digital tools and technologies in historical research practices. The shift from digital history 1.0, which was basically about analysing digital sources with traditional historical research methods, to digital history 2.0, which requires more advanced competences when  “doing things with historical data”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, made historians adopt digital tools, methods and concepts from other disciplines, like the computer sciences, and collaborate with computational experts for analysing large historical datasets. The aim of this article is to investigate the practical and epistemological negotiations of such digital historical research practices in an interdisciplinary setting.</p>
<p>Thereby, we explore how physical spaces of collaboration, specifically the Digital History Lab of the University of Luxembourg and the C²DH open space, could play a role in the formation of trading zones and serve as platforms for interdisciplinary knowledge production and dissemination. It will be argued that physical spaces, like a common office and laboratory, as research and training environments can be conductive for interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange as well as for stimulating processes of thinkering: the playful experimentation with digital tools and technologies for historical research. We argue that training infrastructures enabling hands-on collaboration are constructive for both the formation and transformation of interdisciplinary trading zones in the field of digital history.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  Whether this twofold potential can be realized, however, is dependent on various factors, such as time investment, research profiles, and the willingness to cross disciplinary and discursive boundaries. Reflecting on these matters, this article provides insights that are beneficial for scholars, administrators, curriculum developers and heads of research units in the field of digital history and the wider domain of digital humanities.</p>
<h2 id="12-methodology">1.2 Methodology</h2>
<p>Our analysis draws on literature studies on  “interdisciplinarity”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>,  “infrastructuring”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>,  “trading zones”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, and  “communities of practice”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, and is empirically based on an ethnographic study including the analysis of a series of self-reflexive training reports and semi-structured interviews, in which the PhD students of the DTU reflect on their research practices and experiences of the project’s first year. The reports were written either individually or collectively after the various skills trainings, which were organized during the first year of the DTU as part of its DH incubation phase.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  In total, nine skills trainings were organized, which led to the production of thirty-nine reports in total.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  The reports were analysed and coded on the basis of a number of predefined themes: digital history and hermeneutics, interdisciplinarity, thinkering, infrastructure, communities of practice, and spaces or places of collaboration. In addition, interviews were held with twelve of the PhD students of the DTU.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  Candidates were interviewed once or twice for an average of one hour. All interviews were audio-recorded, fully transcribed and pseudo-anonymized on the basis of the researcher’s disciplinary background, which they could formulate themselves.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  Similar to the self-reflexive training reports, the interviews were analysed and coded on the basis of the aforementioned themes.</p>
<p>The article focuses on the DTU as object of study. The PhD students of the DTU have of course numerous interactions with the wider environment they operate in - e.g. with the C²DH staff, their supervisors, or invited experts from partnering institutions and the wider scientific community.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  Inspired by laboratory studies in social studies of science <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, however, we decided to focus on the PhD students exclusively as a spatially bounded group of their own within which different communities of practice interact <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. This helped us to form a  “micro perspective”  on interdisciplinary collaboration and negotiation practices in the field of digital history <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The DTU is certainly not an exclusive example of a trading zone. Interdisciplinary settings in doctoral education have a long history<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> , and many collaborative projects in digital humanities <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and so-called  “makerspaces”   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> are inspired by the idea of collective thinkering. The specificity of the DTU is its focus on digital history and its emphasis on the hermeneutic reflection on the practices of historical research in the digital age.</p>
<h2 id="13-overview-article">1.3 Overview article</h2>
<p>The article is structured along three complementary perspectives on situated research practices and the Doctoral Training Unit as an interdisciplinary research and training programme. The first perspective, sense of place, investigates the spatial and organizational framework of the DTU, the Digital History Lab, and where and how they are situated in or related to the C²DH as one of the three interdisciplinary research centres of the University of Luxembourg. It also discusses the C²DH open space, which was designed as shared office for all thirteen PhD students of the DTU, to discuss the role of spaces and places of communication in interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
<p>The second perspective explores the DTU as a trading zone in digital history. By zooming in on the research practices and various training activities that were organized within the DTU framework, it analyses how this DTU framework has been experienced in practice by the PhD students. We will identify and distinguish certain boundary objects  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> between the humanities and computer sciences as distinct communities of practice within the DTU as interdisciplinary trading zone.</p>
<p>The third part explores the DTU from the notion of thinkering, providing an epistemological and methodological reflection on the use of digital methods and tools in situated digital historical research practices. In the conclusion, finally, we reflect on some of the main opportunities and challenges of thinkering as pragmatic digital hermeneutics in an interdisciplinary trading zone like the DTU, and the role of the Digital History Lab and the C²DH open space as physical spaces and platforms of collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="2-sense-of-place">2. Sense of place</h2>
<h2 id="21-the-dtu-framework-and-training-programme">2.1 The DTU framework and training programme</h2>
<p>The DTU is hosted by the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH), which is one of the three Interdisciplinary Centres (IC) of the University of Luxembourg. Because of the interdisciplinary character of the DTU, the training unit was a great possibility to strengthen collaboration between researchers (mainly historians) working at the Centre and colleagues from other Centres or Faculties of the University. The DTU team consists not only of the thirteen PhD students, but also includes their supervisors, a coordinating post-doc, the Management Team, and the PI (principal investigator). The DTU is framed by a number of international partner institutions which agreed to support the project and to serve as a critical sounding board for DTU activities.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="aims-and-objectives">Aims and objectives</h2>
<p>The DTU departs from the constatation that there is growing gap or a-synchronicity between the fast development of digital research technologies and infrastructures, and their rather slow appropriation within historical research practices. Everyday we witness the emergence of new digital infrastructures, software and tools, be it for text mining, data visualization, GIS-analysis, virtual and augmented reality apps, et cetera. While these new possibilities are surrounded by a discourse of revolutionary potential for future research, their appropriation in teaching and research is slow and very limited in scale so far. (See for a discussion <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, addressing the question  <em>how</em>  the digital turn does impact the practices of historical research has become more urgent than ever <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. In the introduction to the volume  <em>History in the Digital Age,</em>  Toni Weller stated that  “history as a field of enquiry is standing on the edge of a conceptual precipice. Historians need to be thinking about the radical impact of the digital turn in historiography and historical methodology in a critical and engaged manner”   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. This is exactly the aim of the DTU: to critically reflect on the epistemological and methodological implications of the digital turn in historical research practices. It thereby builds on the concept of digital hermeneutics, defined as the critical and self-reflexive use of digital tools and technologies for the development of new research questions, the testing of analytical assumptions and the production of sophisticated scientific interpretations.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="dtu-skills-trainings">DTU skills trainings</h2>
<p>But how to organize and realize such a training programme in an interdisciplinary and international setting? Based on the assumption that a PhD trajectory runs through several phases, the DTU was divided into three consequent phases: a DH incubation phase (first year), a DH problematization phase (second and third year), and a final phase of writing and defence (third and fourth year). In this article, we will only focus on the first phase, the DH incubation phase, which aimed to familiarize the interdisciplinary group of PhD students with a critical mass of digital methods and tools. For this purpose, nine specific skills trainings were organized within the DTU framework: Text Mining; Digital Source Criticism; Database Structures; Introduction to Programming with Python; Data Visualization; Tool Criticism; Algorithmic Critique; GIS-analysis, Mapping and Cartography; and Experimental Media Ethnography. The aim of the skills trainings in the DH incubation phase was to establish a common ground and shared experiences, and to encourage the PhD students to critically reflect on the use of digital tools and technologies in their own research practices.</p>
<h2 id="22-situated-working-environments-digital-history-lab-and-cdh-open-space">2.2 Situated working environments: Digital History Lab and C²DH open space</h2>
<h2 id="digital-history-lab">Digital History Lab</h2>
<p>The DTU training activities mostly took place in the Digital History Lab. Within the C²DH, the lab has been designed to serve as a space for experimentation and hands-on teaching. It is part of a larger Lab-infrastructure of the Faculty of Humanities, Education and Social Sciences (FHSE) of the University, bringing together five laboratories from different departments (the GIS-Lab, the Experimental Psychology Lab, the Media Lab, the Usability Lab, the Digital History Lab). As these Labs are all located on the first floor of the  “Maison des Sciences Humaines”  (House of the Humanities) (see Figure 1), they offer a fantastic infrastructure for doing hands-on and experimental research in a great variety of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Within this setting, the Digital History Lab is equipped with a multitude of scanning devices and digitization equipment. Designed as a laboratory setting for trainings, seminars, workshops, experiments and as infrastructure for the scanning of research materials and sources, the Digital History Lab has developed into a critical infrastructure for the Centre and a safe environment for playing with digital technologies.</p>

<h2 id="cdh-open-space">C²DH open space</h2>
<p>In order to facilitate the communication and exchange between the thirteen PhD students of the DTU, they were all located together in an open office space of the C²DH. As a collective working space with single offices the open space created some challenges in terms of spatial arrangement, so we decided to group four desks into smaller units in order to create smaller physical and social neighbourhoods. As the open space has step by step been populated by other PhD students who have joined the C²DH since its creation in 2017, it now hosts some thirty PhD students in total and the room is no longer an exclusive space for DTU members. The open space includes a smaller seminar room, which is acoustically isolated from the rest of the open space. This seminar or project room can be used by the DTU students for group discussions or team meetings. Next to the open space, the Centre has installed a cosy communication space with sofas and coffee tables that serves as meeting space for informal exchanges, smaller public events (e.g. guest lectures) as well as space for the monthly plenary sessions of the C²DH in which C²DH staff is informed about ongoing activities, decisions of the Management Team or general University politics.</p>
<h2 id="3-inside-the-trading-zone">3. Inside the Trading Zone</h2>
<p>The DTU has explicitly been designed as a trading zone, as an experimental place for knowledge transfer and exchange between different communities of practice. In the case of the DTU, these include the knowledge domains of history, philosophy, linguistics, geography, archaeology, computer science and human-computer interaction. The concept of trading zone originates from history of science and sociology of knowledge, where it has been used to analyse how different communities of practice interact when working in an interdisciplinary setting <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Communities of practice can be defined as groups of people who collectively engage in shared learning activities and base their group identity on a shared craft, domain and practice <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Three aspects are particularly relevant for analysing the DTU as interdisciplinary trading zone: (1) the notion of interdisciplinarity, (2) the notion of a common ground or common language within interdisciplinary trading zones, and (3) the notion of locality or collaborative space to facilitate interactions between communities of practice. By zooming in on these three aspects of digital history trading zones, this part explores how the DTU framework has been experienced by the PhD students and which boundary objects we can identify between the distinct disciplinary traditions within the DTU.</p>
<h2 id="31-interdisciplinarity">3.1 Interdisciplinarity</h2>
<p>Interdisciplinarity is at the very heart of the concept of trading zone: the transfer and exchange of concepts, methods, tools, techniques and skills between or across different disciplinary fields or domains. Digital history can be framed as an interdisciplinary field or domain of the wider discipline of history, as digital historians have been  “incorporating”  methods and tools from the domain of computer science <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. In  <em>Interdisciplining Digital Humanities</em> , Julie Thompson Klein distinguishes between  “methodological interdisciplinarity”  and  “theoretical and critical interdisciplinarity”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. While methodological interdisciplinarity is concerned with the  <em>application</em>  of digital technologies and their methods to humanities scholarship, theoretical interdisciplinarity concerns the epistemological reflection on the nature of these digital tools and technologies. The DTU explicitly deals with both methodological and theoretical forms of interdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of interdisciplinarity is bringing together approaches and perspectives from different knowledge domains. As one of the PhD students states: we are all  “coming from different [disciplifignary] backgrounds, [&hellip;] have different point[s] of view, [and so] see reality in different ways”  (interview, PhD 1, computer scientist). A good illustration is one of the collaborations that was formed within the DTU framework, in which a digital humanist, linguist and digital heritage specialist worked together in reconstructing the historic landscape of Larochette Luxembourg for a joint article. Bringing in different perspectives and forms of expertise was very beneficial for them, as one of the collaborators explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e all went [to the area] and actually walked around the town of Larochette together. And [the linguist] said:  “Look at the street signs, you can see that this is named after the field that stood here; and look, the church was here because this car park is called graveyard.”  While [the digital heritage specialist] said,  “If you look at the property boundaries between the houses, you can see where the city wall used to be.”  While [the digital humanist] stated:  “If you just take like three steps to the side here, your perspective totally changes.”  [&hellip;] Everybody was literally bringing their view of landscape into it.<br>
(interview, PhD 7, digital heritage specialist)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="opportunities-of-interdisciplinary-collaboration">Opportunities of interdisciplinary collaboration</h2>
<p>The possibility to learn from each other is seen as one of the main benefits and advantages of participating in the DTU. Participants engage in interdisciplinary collaboration because of a certain need for expertise from another field. A PhD student argues:  “Everybody is an expert in a certain field. And if I need something or if I have questions, it’s easy to approach people and ask them what to do.”  (interview, PhD 9, philosopher). Likewise, another PhD student states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know anything about text mining [&hellip;] But I know a lot more about GIS than some others. We are all experts in our own fields, and this makes it nice [to be part of the DTU]. So if I have a question about text mining, there is someone [in the team that] I can ask.<br>
(interview, PhD 2, historian)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While humanities scholars can learn from computer scientists’ expertise of specific digital methods and tools, computer scientists seem to be interested in collaborations with historians especially because they hope to develop specific applications for their models and algorithms. As a computer scientist in the group sums up:  “the historian needs the expertise from the computer scientist, and the computer scientist needs an interesting application. And then they can collaborate”  (interview, PhD 1, computer scientist). Some interdisciplinary collaborations go beyond the mere methodological exchange and applicability of data, but involve a debate about the epistemological underpinnings of disciplinary traditions and schools of thought. A computer scientist in the group states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to look at my data from the perspective of a historian. For example, to analyse how the language of people has changed throughout time. For this I can use the help of a historian: what kind of questions come to mind when they have this kind of data?<br>
(interview, PhD 8, computer scientist) However, sharing or exchanging between methods and perspectives across different disciplinary traditions does not only provide new opportunities. It can also be challenging in practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="challenges-of-interdisciplinary-collaboration">Challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration</h2>
<p>There has been much debate about the longstanding cultural-epistemic differences <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> between the humanities and computer sciences, and whether bringing computational techniques and quantitative methods like statistics to the domain of humanities can make the work of the historian more  “valid”  and  “scientific”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Old questions concerning the validity, objectivity and evidentiary quality of history as a social science that characterized the epistemological debates during the classical period of historicism re-emerge in the digital age through tensions between close and distant (machine-based) reading, exemplary and representative, statistical and historical evidence. Although such dualistic conceptualizations have been challenged ever since the emergence of  “computational humanities”  in the second part of the twentieth century, the idea that historians produce  “subjective interpretations”  and scientists  “objective facts”  as forms of knowledge production still prevails today <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. (See for a discussion on objectivity and subjectivity in scientific knowledge production also <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>The DTU aims to overcome these dichotomies by utilizing the concept of digital hermeneutics. As a  “hermeneutics of in-betweenness”  it allows to address the tensions between quantitative and qualitative or empirical and hermeneutic approaches in a productive way <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. In  <em>Reading Machines</em> , Steven Ramsey similarly argued to  “locate a hermeneutics at the boundary between mechanism and theory”  in order to channel the  “heightened objectivity made possible by the machine into the cultivation of those heightened subjectivities necessary for critical work”   <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. The concept of digital hermeneutics invites us to critically reflect on how digital tools and infrastructures produce new historical information by transforming  “raw”  data into  “cooked”  historical analyses and narratives <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. (For a critique on the idea of data as raw or neutral, see also <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>.)</p>
<p>Despite of the ambition of the DTU to develop the concept of digital hermeneutics as a way to overcome the longstanding cultural and epistemic differences between the humanities and the computer sciences, they nevertheless play an important role in how the PhD students  <em>think</em>  about their communities of practice. The interviews show ample evidence of how the PhD students strongly locate themselves in disciplinary traditions and epistemic cultures. One of the PhD students, for instance, stated that  “the real difference between the humanities and the hard sciences is that the humanities are a lot more subjective in many ways”  (interview, PhD 7, digital heritage specialist) and that  “[f]rom the humanities perspective, everything is about interpretation and perspective”  (interview, PhD 6, digital humanist). Computational methods and techniques, on the other hand, like machine learning and big data algorithms, are perceived to enhance the objectivity of historical analyses. Reflecting on a recent collaboration with a digital historian, for instance, a computer scientist in the group argued that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; if a person looks at the [historical] data and then says something, it’s subjective. It’s human interpretation. While you can [also] ask the same [historical] questions in an objective way using machine learning or any computer science algorithm.<br>
(interview, PhD 1, computer scientist)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using scientific methods in humanities’ scholarship has been perceived to  “prove the validity of your work”  (interview, PhD 6, digital humanist) and to  “strengthen the reproducibility”  of the data analysis (interview, PhD 7, digital heritage specialist). Having a specific working environment or laboratory to do  “scientific experiments”  is seen as helpful in that regard:  “On the third floor [&hellip;] they consider themselves scientists, because they have a lab. They do tests, and they use a scientific method”  (interview, PhD 6, digital humanist).</p>
<p>Computer scientists may indeed use different methods and skills. In order to analyse historical data computationally, for instance, one needs to be able to build a database and work with it. According to a digital historian in the group this is actually one of the most important skills in digital history:  “Simply because we [as historians] have always worked with source material. When we enhance that source material with meta-data, and add this meta-data to a database, we can see more patterns and may discover a lot more than just by looking at the material itself”  (interview, PhD 4, digital historian). However, the same digital historian also warned that if you think like a computer scientist [too much],  “you start seeing things in ones and zeros; whereas reality is often more complex. I think that this complexity is not always thought of in computer science”  (interview, PhD 4, digital historian). Despite of the new opportunities offered by computer scientists, the  “humanist way of thinking and knowledge”  shouldn’t be sacrificed in interdisciplinary trading zones (interview, PhD 3, digital archaeologist). When being asked to reflect on the future of digital history, one of the digital humanists in the group argues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; we have a discourse [at the moment] that technology is good, because it can help you if you already have a humanist mind. But if you don’t, it’s not going to help you develop one. You just base your entire career on these tools. [&hellip;] The most relevant skill [in interdisciplinary collaboration] remains the same that has always been, which is understanding: the humanities approach.<br>
(interview, PhD 6, digital humanist)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="32-common-ground-and-language">3.2 Common ground and language</h2>
<p>A second characteristic of the DTU is the ambition to establish a certain common ground and, possibly, to share a common vocabulary and develop a new  “interlanguage”   <sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. After all, key terms and concepts often mean very different things to different scholars or communities of practice. Whereas historians speak about sources, for example, librarians or archivists talk about documents and computer scientists refer to data. Such terms and concepts can be described as  “boundary objects”  in the negotiation of new knowledge, characterized by a process of  “heuristic groping”   <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Whether a common language really emerges, however, depends on the  <em>type</em>  of trading zone. In their article  “Trading Zones and Interactional Expertise” , Collins et al. differentiate between interlanguage, subversive, enforced and fractionated trading zones <sup id="fnref3:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> (Figure 2). The type of trading zone depends on whether a group is homogeneous or heterogeneous, and whether the trading or group dynamics is based on collaboration or coercion (involving power relations). As opposed to enforced trading zones, which are characterized by high heterogeneity and high coercion, interlanguage trading zones may only develop in groups with strong collaboration and high homogeneity. Subversive trading zones are characterized by a power imbalance between the involved collaborating parties or language communities, whereas fractionated trading zones show a high degree of collaboration and heterogeneity <sup id="fnref4:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. (See for a discussion of the four trading zones also <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.)</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Particularly relevant about this model is the temporal dimension involved in the development of interactional expertise, namely the possibility to  “move between different kinds of trading zones over time”   <sup id="fnref5:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Groups can change, for instance, from enforced trading zones (coercive-heterogeneous) to interlanguage trading zones (collaborative-homogeneous). The ambition to create a  “specific environment for learning, practising and reflecting on digital history”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> combined with the high heterogeneity of the group given the PhD students’ diverse disciplinary backgrounds, ages and nationalities, made the DTU an  <em>enforced trading zone</em>  in the beginning. This was especially the case for the DH incubation phase, in which the skills trainings were meant to establish a common ground among the PhD students.</p>
<h2 id="in-search-of-a-common-ground">In search of a common ground</h2>
<p>The DH incubation phase, as enforced trading zone, partly succeeded in its aim to establish a common ground among the PhD students. The trainings, for instance, provided  “an opportunity to learn something about computer science or philosophy”  (interview, PhD 2, historian) or to deal with technical or practical problems, such as applying or evaluating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to large bodies of textual sources for computational analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is something that the training made me more aware of, I think. For example, when I was going through the frequency tables and texts that I used, I asked myself: when were they OCR’ed? [&hellip;] How good is the OCR? Which libraries applied it? And why have they done this? These are questions that I try to think about, although you cannot always answer them.<br>
(interview, PhD 5, historian)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, the skills trainings were useful to better understand how researchers from other domains are dealing with specific digital tools and methods. For a computer scientist in the group, for instance, GIS-analysis was not  “completely new” , yet still participated in the training out of curiosity  “to see how historians use GIS tools: what kind of questions they try to address and what kind of problems they try to solve”  (report GIS-analysis, PhD 1, computer scientist). Likewise, for another PhD student in the group</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; the most powerful thing [in the training] was to learn how different the problems are that people face in their everyday work and how they are being solved, because the entire purpose of an interdisciplinary group [like the DTU] is to be able to try [certain] methodologies from one field and apply them to another.<br>
(report, PhD 7, digital heritage specialist)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Occasionally, the skills trainings even fostered collaborations between the PhD students and so stimulated a transfer of knowledge and skills across disciplines. In relation to the skills training on programming with Python, for instance, a historian in the group wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For me, it was not always clear how to construct certain parts of the code, or to understand their meaning, but with help from [a digital historian] and [a computer scientist] they made this more insightful for me. […] I learned a lot about Python and that everything starts with being able to read and understand code; something that I am more skilled in now than before the workshop.<br>
(report, Programming with Python, PhD 5, historian)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, the skills trainings also came with a significant time investment. While they were potentially interesting, one of the PhD students remarked that  “the [main] goal is to finish my PhD; that’s the most important thing”  (interview, PhD 2, historian). More PhD students in the group were critical about the trainings, especially because not all of the digital tools, methods and skills were necessarily applicable to their individual PhD research projects – which indeed varied significantly in terms of topic, scale, type of data, method and approach. In fact, the trainings were mostly evaluated based on their applicability and usefulness for the PhD student’s own research. It made one of the PhD students argue that the skills trainings had  “to be elective, because they are not relevant for everyone. If you would just put everyone in the same room and make them study, make them learn, it’s not productive I think. It’s just a waste of time”  (interview, PhD 10, linguist). The PhD student further explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; we all came from different backgrounds [&hellip;] by having one session on text mining, you cannot make a person capable of text mining just after one day. And the same goes about databases. I know that some [of the PhD students] have experience with SQL. I attended the training and all I came out with was just a general understanding of how databases work. [&hellip;] So, it was just an introduction. I think that those trainings, if they had the purpose of bringing everyone to the same level, they didn’t do that. And they couldn’t by definition, by the time frame, by the level. [&hellip;] because everyone has different projects. Not everyone is interested, and gets into the same level of, say, data visualization or programming. Some [of the PhD students] did not want to start programming. They said, [the training] is a waste of time. I’m not going to use it, so why do I need it?<br>
(interview, PhD 10, linguist)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the DTU incubation phase did not serve everyone equally. The question whether the skills trainings should be compulsory or not, was extensively debated within the DTU Management Team as well as by the complete project team during evaluation meetings. Eventually, half-way the first year of the project it was decided to make the trainings no longer compulsory but optional, so the PhD students could choose which trainings were relevant to attend for themselves. The idea to establish a common ground among the PhD students by means of a series of skills trainings in digital humanities research practices, in other words, led to some form of resistance. The DH incubation phase was experienced as an enforced trading zone and, subsequently, led to a renegotiation of the DTU’s training programme, framework and aims.</p>
<h2 id="33-locality-and-physical-proximity">3.3 Locality and physical proximity</h2>
<p>A third characteristic of a trading zone is locality. According to historian of science Peter Galison, locality is central to the definition of a trading zone, which he defines as  “an arena in which radically different activities could be locally, but not globally, coordinated”   <sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Digital humanists, in contrast, often describe or qualify the recent intersection of the humanities and the computer sciences as a  “generalizable global phenomenon”  (see for a discussion <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>). While digital research infrastructures and online communication technologies have certainly fostered new forms of collaboration at a distance, our interest was to study the situated and local research practices.</p>
<h2 id="the-open-space-as-local-trading-zone">The open space as local trading zone</h2>
<p>For the design of the DTU, locality therefore played an important role. One of the project’s distinguishing and grounding principles was to have one shared open office space instead of having team members work in different departments and locations. The concept of the open plan office, typically  “a shared room occupied by more than four people, where desks are arranged in groups, and where there are few barriers between desks”   <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>, can be traced back to the 1920s <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. After the 1960s, the open plan office became implemented more widely in workspace design (see for a brief history <sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>). In academia, however, this development is relatively new. While individual cellular offices remain the norm, there have been movements towards  “more open work environments”  since the early 2000s <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. This trend was pushed, among others, by new managerial and financial paradigms (promoting flexible use of space and cost efficiency <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>) as well as  “demands for more collaborative and interdisciplinary research”   <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. Research in the fields of social psychology and organizational studies shows that group interactions benefit indeed from close proximity: being physically near one another is constructive for (interdisciplinary) collaboration, communication and exchange (see, for instance <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>).<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  With this theory in mind, all thirteen PhD students of the DTU gathered together in one shared office space, also called the C²DH open space (Figure 3).</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For some of the PhD students, being in the same department (C²DH) and being situated in one collaborative working space as a group stimulated exchanges within the team. A PhD student states:  “I think it’s thanks to the open space that we collaborate. Thanks to the fact that we work in a similar department”  (interview, PhD 1, computer scientist). Another PhD student emphasized the importance of physical proximity, which the C²DH open office provides as a working environment:  “It’s important to be near each other. Yes, it creates an opportunity to do something [together]”  (interview, PhD 3, digital archaeologist). Of course, virtual spaces or platforms of communication, like Skype, Facebook and Slack, also provide possibilities for collaboration and exchange:  “You don’t have to be in the same [space in order to collaborate]. I mean, you can use Skype, use different [media], you can even call. [However] it’s easier when you are in the same space”  (interview, PhD 2, historian). One of the downsides of communication via online platforms is that it comes with certain conventions, which could make it more difficult to approach someone else in the group:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am here [in the open space] and the others are also here, it almost doesn’t involve any risks to just easily talk to people. Collaborations almost always start through chats, I think. Well, okay, you can send an official email as well, but in my experience starting off with official emails doesn’t work with people who already have enough interesting things to do.<br>
(interview, PhD 3, digital archaeologist)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Face-to-face communication and presence are mentioned as important characteristics of physical platforms of exchange. As one of the PhD students argued:  “It would be impossible to get any collaboration done if we were working from home all the time. [&hellip;] I think it’s true that face-to-face is important, for initiating collaborations in the least”  (interview, PhD 6, digital humanist).</p>
<h2 id="the-open-space-as-non-trading-zone">The open space as non-trading zone</h2>
<p>While the C²DH open space provides presence, proximity and locality, it clearly came with some limitations as well. One of the main challenges of open plan offices in academia is to find a balance between  “the promotion of communication and collaboration on the one hand and the provision of privacy on the other”   <sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the issues at stake are noise and disturbance. Some of the PhD students prefer to have a quiet space as working environment, where they can concentrate and work on their own without disturbing others:  “If I really have to concentrate on something, if I’m writing something, I prefer to have a space of my own. Because I also feel kind of self-conscious, like I’m disturbing the others if there’s stuff I need to do”  (interview, PhD 7, digital heritage specialist). More participants note that people in the open space  “can’t work really with all the chatting going on”  (interview, PhD 3, digital archaeologist) and signal the fact that  “people are wearing headphones all day just to prevent others from disrupting them from their own project”  (interview, PhD 10, linguist). Some PhD students, on the other hand, prefer to have some background noise:  “Most people don’t like the open space because it’s too loud. I [personally] don’t like the open space, because it’s too quiet”  (interview, PhD 6, digital humanist). The examples make clear how difficult it is to meet the expectations of everyone when it comes to a common working environment.</p>
<p>Another factor limiting the trading zone-effect of the open space was the fact that ten out of the thirteen PhD students of the DTU have a second office in the research institute, department or internal research groups that their supervisor is affiliated to. The wide variety of disciplinary research affiliations created a certain administrative and institutional confusion for some of the PhD students, especially in the beginning of the project. For others, having a second office space was beneficial as it provided a solution to some of the aforementioned problems the PhD students experienced in the open space. It allowed them to divide between specific working environments in relation to types of work that for instance required more concentration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I have the other office [at the Computer Science department] that I use sometimes. I go there once or twice a week, because my supervisor requires me to. That&rsquo;s why I separate [between] my focus time and more easy time.<br>
(interview, PhD 10, linguist) This last citation indicates how the supervisors played an important role in this issue as well. The spatial and institutional division of the PhD students was not very constructive for the building of a trading zone. Certainly, it didn’t help the formation of a certain group identity with the project team. A historian in the group reflected about the second offices in terms of a loss for the DTU:<br>
We [have] already lost two people [ <em>mentions names</em> ]. And [two other PhD students] aren’t here [in the open space] often. [&hellip;] Probably, because they have to be at their department. A lot of us have second offices. I also have one&hellip;<br>
(interview, PhD 2, historian)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A third reason why the open space didn’t foster interactional expertise as expected might be related to the fact that the DTU missed a common research project in which all PhD students would have to participate. Collaborations between PhD students rather happened bottom up and at smaller scale based on shared (thematic) research interests or methodologies.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  A computer scientist in the group argued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[In general] I would say a common environment helps [to stimulate group collaborations]. However, I don’t think ours [the open space] is yet such an environment. [&hellip;] I expected the DTU to have a more common research [project], in which we would all collaborate. That way, I think, the common workplace would be really relevant. But this is somehow missing now. [&hellip;] Most of our exchanges happen in the seminars and in the skills trainings [&hellip;]. Most ideas started from those kinds of meetings.<br>
(interview, PhD 8, computer scientist)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To sum up, the actual exchanges and collaborations did not take place in the open space, but in some of the other venues for collaboration provided by the C²DH and the University. These include, among others, the PhD seminar room, the University’s Learning Centre, the C²DH lounge area, the kitchen next to the open space, the University canteen, and – in the case of the skills trainings and research seminars – the Digital History Lab. The social setting of these venues plays a crucial role in fostering internal exchanges; whether informally over lunch, during a coffee break, or in group activities. While the open space mainly functioned as shared office space, the thinkering happened in these other spaces.</p>
<h2 id="4-thinkering">4. Thinkering</h2>
<p>From the start, the Digital History Lab was designed as a space for doing hands-on experiments with digital tools and technologies. By turning historians into experimenters who experience the  “mangle of practice”   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> of  “science in action”   <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> – such was the original idea – we would combine a pragmatic approach to a hermeneutic process of critical reflection. Such experimental settings of knowledge production have been coined as  “collaborative thinking”   <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>,  “thinkering”   <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>,  “heuristic groping”   <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>, or  “bricolage”   <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. All these concepts build on the idea of a hands-on approach fostering  “situated learning”   <sup id="fnref2:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> and  “learning by doing”   <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. We finally decided to adopt the term thinkering as umbrella term for the hands-on philosophy of C²DH at large, merging the tinkering with technology with the critical reflection on the practice of doing digital history.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="41-thinkering-within-the-dtu-framework">4.1 Thinkering within the DTU framework</h2>
<p>How has the DTU framework stimulated or facilitated such thinkering processes within the project group? Did the skills trainings and research seminars contribute to new forms of knowledge production in digital history research practices?</p>
<p>Building on the concepts of  “digital hermeneutics”   <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>, the so-called  “third wave”  in DH scholarship <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>, and critical approaches to digital humanities <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>, it is increasingly important to understand how digital tools or technologies mediate, represent, structure and produce research results. Since, in the words of one of the PhD students,  “we often use these tools without actually knowing how they work”  (report Digital Source Criticism, group 1). There is thus an urgent need to open the black box and critically reflect on what the use of the digital tool or technology means for the historical research process in all its phases. Or as Jennifer Edmond wrote:  “For historians to harness big data, the black boxes will need to become glass boxes”   <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup> (cf. <sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>).</p>
<p>In order to enable this to happen, the DTU framework focused on (1)  <em>the heuristic potential of thinkering</em> , which involves the methodological implementation of digital tools in historical research practices, and on (2)  <em>thinkering as hermeneutic practice</em> , which involves a critical reflection on the meaning of using such tools and the epistemological consequences of the transformations from source to data to database for historical analysis.</p>
<h2 id="42-the-heuristic-potential-of-thinkering">4.2 The heuristic potential of thinkering</h2>
<p>One of the most applied tools and methods in digital humanities is  “distant reading” : the analysis of large bodies of text-based data by means of computational techniques <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. As one of the PhD students in the group explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;if I have a library of encrypted texts, it would be really time consuming to read all of [these texts] and see how people of this area think about a particular topic. I can [also] do that with an algorithm, if the books are digitized, in less than one hour. [&hellip;] if we can build this environment [within the DTU] between historians and computer scientists, a historian can use this tool for analysing a whole dataset of text for extracting what he has in mind.<br>
(interview, PhD 8, computer scientist)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Distant reading methods were explored specifically in the skills trainings on text mining and programming with Python, where participants experimented with text analysis tools, like Voyant <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>. In one of the DTU research seminars, a historian in the group showed how applying distant reading techniques could be useful to find, analyse and visualize meaningful patterns in a digital corpus of historical texts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; looking for specific words and when counting them over time, you really saw something happening. [&hellip;] because of the word frequencies, you could zoom in on certain things, for instance how they changed over time. And then it appeared that for all my [historical] journals something was happening in the same year.<br>
(interview, PhD 5, historian)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, in the skills training on data visualization, it was explored how network visualization tools like Palladio and Gephi could be used as heuristic instruments to  “show new and to that point unknown connections in the data”  (report Data Visualization, PhD 2, historian). Visualizing such connections  “may help us see trends and patterns which may not be seen in, for example, a spreadsheet containing a lot of numerical data, or in an unstructured text”  (report Data Visualization, PhD 10, linguist). It may even help  “to find anomalies or even mistakes in data,”  which were not visible before (report Data Visualization, PhD 8, computer scientist).</p>
<p>As one of the PhD students remarks in this regard, the shift from close reading as traditional approach in the humanities to distant reading with text mining  “is all about ignoring specific features of individual texts of the corpus and focusing instead on identifying large-scale trends and patterns throughout the collection”  (report Text Mining, PhD 10, linguist). Sometimes additional tools had to be used to remove certain elements in order to make the digitized map more useful for GIS-analysis (Figure 4):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; the georeferencing process requires a high level of accuracy to map physical space onto a map while maintaining the correct proportions. This meant editing via Photoshop to remove unnecessary whitespace, especially at the joints of the map where it folds. During my first georeferencing attempt, the software was unable to proportionally juxtapose the image of the map with the georeferenced data. By removing white space it increased the overall accuracy.<br>
(report GIS-analysis, PhD 6, digital humanist)</p>

<p>Before being mined, searched through, or visualized, data thus needs to be corrected, adjusted or (re)structured to make them suitable for computational analysis. In the skills training on Database Structures, participants learned how to structure big data into SQL databases and work with queries to search through and analyse specific datasets. However, the creation and implementation of database structures also came with certain challenges. As one of the participants wrote:  “Although it seems easy at first, thinking about establishing a database from scratch is quite a complex feat. The need arises to think about the categories and relationships of the data that is to be put into the database”  (report Database Structures, PhD 11, linguist). Thinking about databases and which categories and relationships to include is not just a technical, but also a conceptual exercise. For example, in an internal collaboration on gender in computer science conferences, thinking about data categories and relationships led to a problem of how to cluster data in a database for making useful queries. Structuring data by means of an ontology and entity relationship diagram finally resulted in a graphical representation of the relations between certain data entities and their attributes (Figure 5). However, what exactly constitutes an entity, relation or attribute is subject to human interpretation and therefore not always self-evident:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, first we were thinking about putting the People category [&hellip;] in the Individuals table, but then we saw this would work better as a separate table. We first created the diagram on paper, and also visualized/sketched our database tables to make the structure more clear and understandable for ourselves<br>
(report Database Structures, PhD 5, historian; PhD 4, digital historian; PhD 10, linguist)</p>

<p>In short, by thinkering with digital methods and tools in the skills trainings and research seminars, the PhD students learned about how to work with database structures, text mining algorithms and data visualization techniques in order to analyse, visualize and interpret their historical sources and to discover certain meaningful patterns, relations or anomalies. However, as historians of science and technology have argued before, using a tool is  “neither good, nor bad, nor neutral”   <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>, but also shapes our practices and interpretative framework <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Consequently, structuring and representing data by means of databases and ontologies inevitably involves some form of transformation, translation and interpretation, which is necessary to reflect on as well.</p>
<h2 id="43-thinkering-as-hermeneutic-practice">4.3 Thinkering as hermeneutic practice</h2>
<p>Applying digital methods and tools not only comes with methodological challenges and opportunities, but also implies certain epistemological consequences that need to be addressed by the historian or humanities scholar.</p>
<h2 id="from-source-to-data">From source to data</h2>
<p>Since most historians in the group are not dealing with born-digital sources but with retro-digitized sources, the skills training on digital source criticism explored the transformation process from a historical source to data by means of hands-on exercises. In the exercises, participants needed to digitize a historical source themselves – a historical text, analogue photo, audio recording, or 3D object. This made them conscious about the ontological shift in the digitization process and how this impacts their research practices. One of the participants realised  “how actual pieces of reality are transformed from a historical type of knowledge to [a] quantified one during the process of digitisation, and how inanimate the data loss is”  (report Digital Source Criticism, group 1, PhD 3, digital archaeologist). Another participant confessed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I became much more aware of the process that is behind all kinds of digitisation techniques: from scanning books, to digitising pictures, audio or 3D material. [&hellip;] Before the workshop I hadn’t thought about if or how digitalisation altered my source material.<br>
(report Digital Source Criticism, group 1, PhD 5, historian)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other participants reflected on the loss of certain physical and material qualities. Due to the transformation from material source to data, they argued,  “it is not a physical object anymore [&hellip;] we can’t touch, taste and smell the photo [&hellip;] weigh the picture or feel what kind of texture the paper is made of”  (report Digital Source Criticism, group 1). Another report mentions the loss of  “scale, colour, size, materiality, scent, sound, historical sensation and context, storage, preservation, restoration, price, accessibility, emotional / commercial / scientific value, whether it is personal or public property, which power relations can be involved, etc.”  (report Digital Source Criticism, group 4). Reflecting on what such loss of material qualities could mean for the historian in the hermeneutic research process, one of the PhD students states in the report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found it surprising that when you manipulate sound on a computer and for example cut and paste different pieces of audio, it is almost impossible to trace if or when parts were changed. This creates problems for historical research as it is almost impossible to know what the original file was.<br>
(report Digital Source Criticism, group 1, PhD 5, historian)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other side, people noticed how the digitization process not only led to a potential loss of information, but could also enhance the possibilities for research and investigation: a digitized source  “allows digital touch-ups, zooming, and other new functionalities”  (report Digital Source Criticism, group 2). Digitization, in other words, makes the source more accessible and searchable:  “Being able to zoom in, the background of the picture becomes somewhat clearer and shows us that there is a window in the back of the photograph. Although we manipulate the picture by zooming in to get a closer look, we don’t lose the  original  data file of the picture”  (report Digital Source Criticism, group 1). However, as another report argues:  “greater accessibility [&hellip;] would turn out to be useless if digitised sources lack the necessary metadata”  (report Digital Source Criticism, group 2). It exemplifies the importance of source criticism as a key competence of doing history in the digital age.<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="from-data-to-database">From data to database</h2>
<p>In addition to the reflection on the transformation from source to data, the skills trainings also reflected on the epistemological consequences of the transformation from data to database. Especially the skills training on Database Structures discussed how the transformation from data to database could have an impact on the process of historical interpretation and understanding. One of the participants raised the question as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Databases represent data in a highly structured way. This means that we had to bring our raw data into a structured form. We did this by creating an ontology. [However] if the database is set up with the help of this ontology, it can be difficult to reconstruct the decisions that led to the creation of the ontology and the database. In this way, it could be the case, that some potentially valuable information is lost.<br>
(report Database Structures, PhD 9, philosopher)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems of crucial importance to reflect on and be critical about how database structures may impact research results, not only in terms of their indexical logic and semantic hierarchy, but also in terms of missing or corrupted information. Close reading is therefore necessary to complement – or possibly to contradict – certain results produced by distant reading methodologies. As some of the PhD students argue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through close reading and entering provisional data into the dataset we noticed that some issues remained unresolved. Most problems relate to missing data, and sometimes it is very hard to define family relations when people do not have a name (i.e. three sisters, my father). One possible solution would be an added field called other names (i.e. father of person x).<br>
(report Database Structures, PhD 5, historian; PhD 4, digital historian; PhD 10, linguist)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question of representation and the importance of being conscious about possible errors or mistakes hidden in the raw data played a crucial role in participants’ reflections. Based on experiences with the data visualization tool Tableau, one of the historians in the group stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this experiment, I learned once again that it is very important to treat your data very securely, because only after doing these experiments and going back to my data files I noticed that I did not see certain faults that were still in the data files that I used. This constituted for example empty cells that were not supposed to be empty, countries or parts of a country that were not streamlined [such as] the use of UK when England is mentioned, but writing UK Scotland when the correspondent was from a Scottish city [&hellip;] Before starting to explore information visually it is [therefore] important that you double-check all your information at least twice or three times, otherwise you keep going back and forth between the data and the visualizations which can take up a lot of time — as was the case with the experiments I did<br>
(report Data Visualization, PhD 5, historian)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The various examples show that experimenting with digital methods and tools served both a heuristic and hermeneutic objective. In short, the DTU skills trainings and researchers seminars enabled PhD students to acquire both a practical and a conceptual tool kit fostering a more reflexive attitude in digital history research practices.</p>
<h2 id="5-conclusions">5. Conclusions</h2>
<p>Digital history, as an interdisciplinary field, has brought both challenges and opportunities to situated research practices. While the DTU training programme has certainly contributed to the development of both a practical and conceptual tool kit among the PhD students involved, the question remains whether it has also contributed to the idea of the DTU as a digital history trading zone. To what extent have the skills trainings and research seminars stimulated interdisciplinary collaborations and contributed to the development of a common ground and interlanguage within the team?</p>
<h2 id="51-between-formative-and-transformative-trading-zones">5.1 Between formative and transformative trading zones</h2>
<p>We can identify various tensions in both the formation and transformation of the DTU as a digital history trading zone. With formation, we mean the importance of institutional spaces (i.e. C²DH open office) and research infrastructures (i.e. Digital History Lab) in the establishment and development of the DTU as platform for interdisciplinary collaboration and thinkering. With transformation, we mean the impact of situated research and thinkering processes on new digital history research practices and the  “interdisciplinary acculturation”   <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup> (cf. <a href="#kemman2019">Kemman 2019</a>) among participating PhD students. Though formative and transformative trading zones are intrinsically related, it is helpful to distinguish between the different dynamics involved.</p>
<p>We have discussed how interdisciplinary exchange and collaboration comes with a significant time investment. Since the PhD students have to finish their individual PhD dissertations within three to four years, this puts a certain constraint or limitation on the amount of time that they can invest in interdisciplinary interactions. In other words, from the beginning of the DTU, there has been an ongoing tension between the individual PhD research on the one side and the collaborative aims of the DTU as interdisciplinary project on the other. The tensions between individual and collaborative work were to a certain degree mirrored and even reinforced by institutional tensions between the C²DH – as host institute of the DTU – and the other research institutes or departments that ten of the thirteen PhD students (and their supervisors) are affiliated to. The dynamics between the various institutional affiliations led to centrifugal forces, challenging the shared open space as initial trading zone for the project.</p>
<p>In addition to the tensions in the formative trading zone, the perceived dichotomies between the humanities and the computer sciences as subjective versus objective forms of research make proof of disciplinary tensions in the transformative trading zone. Although the DTU skills trainings were potentially helpful to establish a common ground and so stimulated interdisciplinary exchanges and connections among the PhD students, they also came with some form of interdisciplinary resistance. Not only on the side of the PhD students, but also on the side of the supervisors and instructors of the skills trainings.</p>
<p>Transforming the formative trading zone into a trading zone were interlanguage and real interactional expertise were happening proved basically to be a challenge of communication. In fact, the skills trainings have made discursive differences between disciplines explicit. It is through the collaborative work that the different epistemic traditions become visible and make people aware of the implicit traditions of their community of practice. By experiencing these differences and making them a topic of reflection, the enforced trading zone at the beginning of the DTU slowly but steadily changed into a transformative trading zone which was able to adapt to the specific needs and interests of the PhD students involved. Sometimes, even a new terminology or interlanguage appeared, bridging (discursive) disciplinary boundaries. In one of the self-reflexive reports on the skills training on GIS-analysis, for example, a participant describes an original historical map as a non digital-born source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our task was to identify ground points both on the historical map and the digital map in order to match the former with the latter and “anchor” the historical map to the digital one. In this way,  <em>a non digital-born source</em>  such as an historical map can be not only digitalised but also enriched with other digital information and be suitable for analysis using digital tools.<br>
(report GIS-analysis, PhD 1, computer scientist, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="52-lessons-learned">5.2 Lessons learned</h2>
<p>We can draw at least three concrete lessons learned. The first lesson is the meaning of spaces and places of collaboration and communication for interdisciplinary projects. When organizing an interdisciplinary doctoral training unit, most of the attention often goes to the creation of an interesting training programme or curriculum. Based on our reflections of the Digital History Lab and the C²DH open space as situated research and training environments, however, we found that the spatial dimension is just as important for establishing an interdisciplinary trading zone. A second lesson concerns the governance of this trading zone, in particular the disciplinary and institutional disparity resulting from the dynamics between the C²DH, as the host institution of the DTU, and the various disciplinary research institutes that the PhD students and their supervisors are affiliated to. Unlike some of the literature on interdisciplinarity in digital humanities, we learned that the value of bridging disciplinary gaps in a digital history project is actually not a given – even among the DTU team members. For this, perhaps, the supervisors could have played a more stimulating role in the centralization of the DTU as an interdisciplinary project. A third lesson is that the tension between the individual PhD research and the aims of the DTU as a collaborative project could be solved, at least partly, by designing common research projects within the DTU framework right from the beginning. Although some bottom-up and small scale collaborations already emerged in the first year, and new ones have been formed in the second year as well, the question is whether such internal group collaborations could have been stimulated more, or whether this would have created just another instrumentalization of interdisciplinary collaboration similar to the DH incubation phase.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we argue that the formation and transformation of interdisciplinary trading zones depends on various factors, including time investment, collaborative spaces and research infrastructures, communication skills, research profiles, and scholars willingness and ability to cross both spatial and disciplinary boundaries. Getting PhD students out of their disciplinary comfort zone and making them fit for an interdisciplinary trading zone thus comes with a lot of challenges. Instead of striving for a homogeneous and fully collaborative interlanguage trading zone - which possibly remains a theoretical option rather than a realistic possibility - we argue that digital history trading zones should actually embrace their own diversity, heterogeneity and hybridity <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>. Because, as Peter Weingart has argued,  “interdisciplinarity is not the promise of ultimate unity, but of innovation and surprise by way of recombining of different parts of knowledge, no matter which”   <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>. The creative uncertainty that results from such engagement clearly fosters new questions and curiosity – which should be the aim and motivation of any scientific endeavour.</p>

<p>The reports were part of the skills training’s final assignment, for which the PhD students could obtain credits as part of their formal doctoral school training. The purpose of the reports was to critically reflect on the learning processes and outcomes of the skills trainings, for instance the challenges of working with a particular digital tool, like Tableau, QGIS or Voyant. Some of the reports were published on the blog of the DTU website (<a href="https://dhh.uni.lu/category/blog/">https://dhh.uni.lu/category/blog/</a>) as well as on some of the PhD students’ personal blogs.&#160;<a href="#fnref:13" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

One is a project between a computer scientist and a digital historian, who collaborated to analyse the role of gender in computer science conferences by means of digital classification of research areas based on topic modelling. Another interdisciplinary publication within the DTU includes the collaboration between a digital humanist, digital heritage specialist and linguist, dealing with the 3D reconstruction of the historic landscape of Larochette Luxembourg in cultural heritage education by means of building a virtual reality application.

<p>We live in a world connected not merely by technology but also by infrastructure, which seamlessly delivers data to our doors. What’s more, in today’s university, many a professor has become a designer of infrastructure as well as a consumer. While portals of this kind are developed by a minority of practicing scholars, they form one of the major digital complements that scholars tend to create for their traditional work. The reasons for this are seldom explicitly articulated in the existing literature that documents their use and purpose. The creation of public tools for visualizing data is increasingly important to many scholars, and it represents a non-negligible commitment in terms of time and grant money.</p>
<p>This article argues that that choice and commitment are best understood as a kind of work deeply informed by an engagement with certain  <em>values</em> , including scholarly transparency and political participation, which often align with scholars’ moral commitments, intellectual heritage, and disciplinary traditions. Indeed, that alignment has been so powerful for many builders of scholarly data that they have chosen to pursue the building of infrastructure projects even when that choice was otherwise out of alignment with recognizable promotion incentives in their professional communities.</p>
<p>In many cases, the infrastructure project advances an argument: but if web portals existed merely to convey arguments to a broader audience, they could just as easily take the form of an open-access article or monography. Why, then, would a scholar or a scholarly team choose to invest their energy in designing and constructing a web project?</p>
<p>The pages that follow then attempt to answer the question: what values does infrastructure-building represent? This article begins by situating scholarly practices around infrastructure within a broader transformation of twenty-first century life and indeed scholarship and learning by infrastructures, and distinguishing scholarly infrastructure from other kinds of infrastructure designed to share information that nevertheless lack scholarly engagement with analysis. The article next attempts to excavate a set of implicit values, while making room for the possibility that the list of values put forward here is only incomplete, and that the list of values itself is the subject of potential debate, critique, or dissent, some of which may take the form of building infrastructures differently than the patterns laid out here. A first section outlines a set of bibliographic values; while the article’s second half turns to the power dynamics of infrastructure and a set of critical  values encompassed by particular projects, before turning to the issue of why understanding these values is so essential to understanding infrastructure projects as a form of scholarly production that merit support and recognition by the community at large.</p>
<p>The principles and case-studies here suggest that infrastructure represents a conscientious choice about the format for disseminating that argument that reflects critical thinking about the value of scholarship. In designing infrastructure, many scholars today are amplifying the values embedded in their scholarship – whether values of accessibility, of replicability, or even of the political critique of institutions – and that for this reason, infrastructure needs to be looked on as a particular kind of gesture, one that not merely critiques the world but attempts to actively remake it. The author’s personal history as a theorist/historian of infrastructure and sometime builder of infrastructure are offered by way of laying out the importance of the scholarly community engaging with the critical issues represented by a choice to build – and the hazards to professional careers that can occur when activities of this kind are undertheorized, underengaged, or otherwise underappreciated. Infrastructure thereby deserves to be elevated within a humanistic discourse that privileges action as well as contemplation.</p>
<h2 id="of-infrastructure">Of Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Web portals that visualize data may strike many scholars as a strange place to begin a discussion of infrastructure. Visualizing data, of course, is but part from the whole, even as a physical mailbox is invisibly connected to a network of roads and trains, law and labor, standards and trust — so familiar that it too disappears into the background of landscape taken everywhere for granted — which allows letters posted in one continent to be delivered promptly to another quarter of the world within days. The colossus of infrastructure that has developed in university libraries and digital humanities centers to make possible the scraping, cleaning, and serving of data is the subject of a great deal of documentation, much of which takes the role of making visible otherwise invisible commitments of expense, labor, maintenance, and ideation.</p>
<p>As understood in its broadest form, infrastructure encompasses any use of technology or information which connects communities. Science and technology scholars such as Janet Vertesi have defined infrastructure in terms of a technology or management structure distinguished by its deliberate design, its scale, its capacity to deliver information, and, frequently, its invisibility <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In the digital age, new infrastructures have rapidly transformed how ordinary citizens as well as scholars access information. Individuals read e-books, consult maps, and digest newspapers whose delivery depends upon a vast infrastructure system ranging from transoceanic cables to smart phones <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scholarship too has grown to depend increasingly on a world of invisible technologies. Already in 2010, Geoffrey Rockwell described an  “infrastructure turn”  that was shaping how a majority of scholars accessed data <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which entailed new worlds of labor, storage, and expense for universities, much of which required new skills at managing digital data. Tara McPherson, founder and editor of a journal that provided one infrastructure for delivering digital projects to readers, described the creation of a  “broader culture of experimentation and change”  among faculty, particularly those with a specialty in visual analysis, as requiring new developments in infrastructure that would service, validate, and share faculty experiments – from accessible to journals tenure and review processes <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Indeed, a broad range of institutional players came into being at most universities and within many disciplines, including digital humanities centers, digital humanities majors, institutional repositories, and new guidelines for dissertation-writing and for the tenure and promotion of faculty <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Libraries began to engage data storage, standards that define the data, the data itself, metadata, and applications that retrieve and serve the data, as well as hardware, software, and structures for the management of labor <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Researchers can turn to an emerging field of similarly interoperable tools that put quantitative analysis of texts within the grasp of textual scholars from any tradition in the humanities or social sciences. Among those tools are <a href="https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/ARTFL/philologic/">   <em>PhiloLogic</em>   </a>,UChicago’s browser for topic-modeling text, analyzing word co-occurrence and re-use; <a href="https://www.hypershelf.org/">   <em>InPho Topic Explorer</em>   </a>, which allows users to apply topic modeling to their own body of text; <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">   <em>Voyant</em>   </a>, a simple web-interface which allows the user to pipe a selection of text through a variety of visualizations; <a href="https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/">   <em>Palladio</em>   </a>, Stanford’s application for visualizing correspondence such as letters within a social network; <a href="https://www.cortext.net/">   <em>CorTexT</em>   </a>, Jean-Philippe Cointet’s extremely flexible and strong tool for language-based analysis on a body of text with temporal metadata; and <a href="https://archivesunleashed.org/">   <em>Archives Unleashed</em>   </a>, Ian Milligan’s toolbox for digital humanities and social sciences analysis of archives.</p>
<p>There are also, of course, individual repositories of texts that offer particular tools for a unique set of documents, especially JSTOR’s data for research portal, the online instance of the <a href="http://oldbaileyonline.org/">   <em>Old Bailey</em>   </a>, as well as an expanding range of online portals for individual moments in time; those covered in this article include <a href="http://slavevoyages.org/">   <em>Slave Voyages</em>   </a>, the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/">   <em>Legacies of the British Slave-Ownership</em>   </a> project, and <a href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/volume/2/index">   <em>Torn Apart/Separados</em>   </a>, a project that documents the contemporary incarceration of immigrants and their families in the U.S. Effort will be made in this discussion to foreground the author’s personal experience of the successes and failures of the <a href="http://papermachines.org/">   <em>Paper Machines</em>   </a> experiment, and the strengths of the infrastructure that supplanted it, towards a genealogy of the design principles appropriate to infrastructure in the humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>Even more recently, Roopika Risam has argued for the existence of a postcolonial DH, marked by an  “ethos of building,”  where scholars create infrastructure to reconfigure access to suppressed voices that document the experience of colonization. She points to several examples of projects where scholars used infrastructure to reinterpret and challenge colonial world-making projects implicit in archives, by assembling alternative archives of information that supported research on the experience of colonized persons. Risam gives numerous examples that document the variety and importance of this work, including The Early Caribbean Digital Archive and the Online Tagore Variorum, which reassemble scattered texts documenting the experience of colonized persons, as well as Chicana por mi Raza, an archive of oral histories, ephemera, out-of-print publications that provide resources for Latina/o experience, and The Indigenous Digital Archive in New Mexico, which made available the records of Hope and Diné experience with boarding schools. Infrastructure in this case is at work reassembling the scattered voices of colonized persons, constructing alternative archives that challenge and actively provide alternatives to libraries whose holdings predominantly reflect the information matrix of the colonizer. In Risam’s eloquent phrase,  “The archive uses technology to push back against dominant cultural representations of indigenous communities”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Scholarly creation of infrastructure has become a primary realm of critical encounter with public narratives about culture, identity, and the past. Scholars who have engaged this space have forged an entirely new modality of scholarly publishing, one with tremendous power to shape public discourse. It is not clear, however, that all forms of infrastructure constitute a critical intervention in scholarship. The <a href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> is a stalwart repository for preserving the historical artifacts, the creation of which surely constituted a political act in its time. Many of its sub-collections – for instance, troves of anthropological films collected by universities over decades — represent some work of critical scholarship. Nevertheless, it would be hard to argue that the Internet Archive’s little-curated collection of historical objects represents a scholarly intervention in any particular field. While not a scholarly piece of infrastructure by design, the Internet Archive’s voluminous collections of scanned books, archival videos, and recordings nevertheless consists of a potential site of future critical interventions such as OCR, metadata, preservation, and collection analysis. Thus the distinction between scholarly and non-scholarly infrastructure is not hard and fast.</p>
<p>In a critical review of existing digital humanities and social sciences projects, I have attempted to derive an overview of the values that motivated those projects via their expression in public-facing websites. The idea that a piece of infrastructure may encapsulate scholarly values is premised, in the first place, upon the implicit understanding that the designers of infrastructure have already made critical argumentation, embedded within the larger culture of critical thinking about technology and culture, and inspired by its insights. In other words, this article advances the proposition that the design of infrastructure, when it engages critically with existing thought about power, represents a form of scholarly argumentation.</p>
<p>In the following sections, this article will take the first step towards articulating some principles that define the culture of infrastructure. These principles are divided in two parts, reflecting the distance between the concepts of scholarship and criticality that I have teased apart in the introduction. A set of bibliographic principles of infrastructure describe the principles that bring data into alignment with traditional bibliophilic concerns about verifiability and fact in the liberal arts, including web tools that link directly back to particular manuscripts in particular archives. A set of critical principles of infrastructure describe the kind of interventions that render the invisible visible, and which otherwise mirror the kind of critical thinking called upon by Arendt and others as a liberatory intervention in the public sphere.</p>
<p>The principles advanced in this essay are merely a starting point – a review of possible sources, both from the traditional humanities and social sciences and from critical politics, which begins with an autobiographical narrative of the author’s own participation in the design and building of a piece of infrastructure. It is hoped that this starter list of principles will be amended and argued with, towards the creation of a more critical discourse about what humanistic infrastructure looks like and where critical thinking takes place, with the expected outcome of generating a scholarly discourse about the choices made in designing infrastructures for the public. An essay of this kind affords an opportunity to reflect on the public purposes and intellectual orientation intended in the building of infrastructure, and the extent to which humanities and social science critiques of the flow of information and power in society have resulted in the creation of alternative or transformative flows.</p>
<h2 id="infrastructure-as-proto-argumentation">Infrastructure as Proto-Argumentation</h2>
<p>In enabling the researcher to efficiently identify the patterns that characterize a vast scale of documents, infrastructure can seed dozens or hundreds of scholarly arguments. The infrastructure thus represents a proto-argument, if not an argument or analysis itself.</p>
<p>What do I mean by proto-argument? An infrastructure contains constraints that structure and direct the format of the argument eventually produced over them, even as the shape of opera houses in London and Turin framed civic ambitions, structuring how later compositions, libretti, and performances would be received; those opera houses hosted hundreds or thousands of later productions.</p>
<p>In relationships of this kind, the architect’s work was often to envision and crystallize a set of intellectual values and ideological ambitions latent in opera. As historians of the opera have reasoned, the work of the architect was to offer a framework of imagination that included  “civic ambition,”    “unabashed commercialism,”  and  “international cosmopolitanism,”  which ran in parallel to textual forms of argument-making about history, civic identity, and teleology <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Indeed, the opera house structured the reception of operas within a  “penumbra of exclusivity”  that mirrored the social structuring of other forms of enlightenment knowledge <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Hence the proto in proto-argument. The architect’s work codified enlightenment values into a structure that would both enhance later performances, extend the potential of the. The creation of the vessel represents the moment in time when an ideology is crystallized into a form where it can be replicated. Much of the work of conceptualizing what  <em>Aida</em>  — as an epic about the tragedy of gender, race, and empire — might be was thus the work of a generation of architects and opera-designers who worked previous to Verdi’s masterpiece. Similarly, the infrastructure allows the application of one  <em>theory</em>  of text or temporality to a million data sets.</p>
<p>Architecture and infrastructure both function simultaneously as creation, vessel, and constraint. They are proto-arguments in the sense that they structure the natural course of use, exchange, and argumentation that follows from an original design. One cannot stage a Brechtian play in an opera house. In a state of disaffection, one might  <em>imagine</em>  dissolving the fourth wall from the opera house at Turin, but one would have to build a totally different kind of theater in order to realize it.</p>
<p>Similarly, scholarly infrastructures that curate particular choices of word analysis – grammar, topic, bag-of-words; transparent or not, open to interpretation or not – package an entire system of understanding about what a text is, what components of grammatical and semiotic structure or historical context matter, and who is allowed to participate in the interpretation of text. Scholarly infrastructure can be designed in such a way as to elucidate the critical function of scholarship or to diminish it; and to expand public access to polysemous interpretations or battles over the historical record or to channel them. All of those choices have enormous downstream implications for what scholarship can be executed, published, or received.</p>
<p>Builder-scholars, over the last decade, have made legion critical decisions that open up corpora to possible kinds of engagement. <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams">Google Ngrams</a> does not allow the scholar to inquire about word co-location as PhiloLogic does; Cortext allows the user to highlight discontinuities in time in a way that few other resources do; each innovation in analysis represents an opening to a critical question, informed by concerns in linguistics or history, bringing the theories of disciplines into alignment with algorithms and corpus in such a way as to  _scale _  theory into an analysis with new documents.</p>
<p>Builder-scholars are also, as I shall argue below, responsible for making choices that govern who has the opportunity to inspect, to use, or to interpret data, thus structuring entire communities of knowledge. The builder’s decisions – to model gender or not, to open the structure, to an enormous degree, whether and how fluidly later scholars who use the infrastructure will be able to compare the use of gender, race, or class in the text; whether hours, days, years, or decades of change over time are susceptible to analysis; and who is allowed to make that analysis – whether a scholarly elite or anyone at all.</p>
<p>To embrace this perspective made atop a web portal is to highlight the hybridity of labor in discoveries, where both the design of infrastructure and the scholarly analysis built upon those discoveries are crucial. When an award-winning paper is published that relies on the metrics of gender difference encoded in historical data made available by a public-facing portal, is the award properly given to the paper’s author, or to the website’s designer, who identified gender difference as a key component of that data, fit the data with the correct algorithm for analysis, and made the results available? Arguably, the award would properly be given to both: not only because the paper would be impossible without the labor of the data, but also because a large portion of the critical perspective implicit in the paper was given in advance by the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Above all, this line of reasoning underscores that the design and building of portals is itself an act of imagination, and possible critique. In the following section, I will propose some general lines of reasoning about what kinds of imagination and critique the present generations of portals embody.</p>
<h2 id="the-bibliographic-principles-of-scholarly-infrastructure">The Bibliographic Principles of Scholarly Infrastructure</h2>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-transparency-with-respect-to-a-document-base">The Principle of Transparency with Respect to a Document Base.</h2>
<p>One challenge of interoperability is making sure that the origin and nature of artifacts is preserved, even as information is exchanged. A variety of tools – including <a href="https://omeka.org/">   <em>Omeka</em>   </a> and <a href="https://duraspace.org/fedora/">   <em>Fedora Commons</em>   </a> — make possible the tracking of metadata about archival objects <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. A user in the humanities needs always to know on what documents and particular words a visualization is based. Only in this way can the user defend herself against the critical challenges of readers who will want to know if a homonym has been used in different sense, if a single word example counted by a computer is based on an OCR error, or if the statement counted as an earnest example of nationalism was made in jest.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is crucial that humanities infrastructure be designed so that every visualization is transparent. Each visualization based on data in an archive should be clickable; each word or point on a chart should link to another page that cites the documents and passages represented by that analysis. Ideally, each list of citations should link back to the snippet of original text that was counted to create the analysis. Where copyright allows, that snippet of original text would link back to the original scan of the document itself.</p>
<p>The University of Chicago’s <a href="http://guides.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/philologic">   <em>PhiloLogic</em>   </a> platform is a paragon of this value: visualizations of keyword prevalence over time can be linked to original passages in the text, which link back to chapter and edition, with the result that the scholar is always clear about upon which original texts a visualization is based, and how those individual parts of the text relate to a larger text and cycle of publication.</p>
<p><em>Paper Machines</em>  singularly failed with regard to this principle of clickability, but other infrastructures are more satisfying. In  <em>PhiloLogic</em> , each visualization of word counts over time links to a list of documents and passages that links to the original text in its context. In the <a href="https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/">   <em>Old Bailey</em>   </a>, keyword searches and crime searches link back to passages that link to the original scans of the document. The user is never deluded with respect to the evidence and where it comes from. Adherence to the Principle of Transparency with Respect to a Document Base ensures that users, both scholarly and vernacular, can link abstract word counts to original text, whether by looking up the citation given or through a link to a verbatim copy of an original text.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-interoperability-with-existing-documents">The Principle of Interoperability with Existing Documents.</h2>
<p>A basic orientation of Paper Machines that the prosthesis must be interoperable with the material that scholars already had on their computers. Despite the range of national and temporal orientations, every research scholar I knew worked with pdfs, which had recently become the standard digitized format for journal articles and scanned books. A single application would accept pdf’s and churn out a text version of the article (presumably with the noise of headers, footers, and page numbers intact). Despite the noise, the information encoded in the text would be sufficient for us to design the application so that it could generalize about collections of pdf’s, for instance creating word clouds that suggested the transition of pdf’s in a single field from one decade to the next.</p>
<p><a href="http://papermachines.org/">   <em>Paper Machines</em>   </a> was thus designed to operate within existing infrastructure – depending on the folders of pdf’s that users already had on their machines. I originally imagined it as a kind of box, into which a user would drag folders of documents, with the result of producing visualizations about the contents of those folders. Eventually, my co-designer, Christopher Johnson-Roberson, proposed a tool that would scrape text and generate visualizations from inside another existing piece of humanities infrastructure: <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">   <em>Zotero</em>   </a>, the application that many humanists use to organize their citations for books, articles, and archival materials. Inside  <em>Zotero</em> ,  <em>Paper Machines</em>  operated as a right-click menu that offered a set of commands by which a researcher could extract text from a file, or order that text to be generalized into topic models, word clouds, or networks of phrases.</p>
<p>Today, a variety of humanities applications, including <a href="https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/">   <em>Palladio</em>   </a> and <a href="https://www.cortext.net/">   <em>Cortext</em>   </a> allow users to upload their own data, typically accepting files in the form of text or Excel document. Tools like <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">   <em>Voyant</em>   </a> and <a href="https://www.hypershelf.org/">   <em>InPho Topic Explorer</em>   </a> allow scholars to cut-and-paste raw text from any source. PhiloLogic works with any TEI-encoded text sent directly to its editors for uploading. Portals of this kind offer an invaluable resource for scholars with little technical background who wish to take advantage of existing digital tools to analyze text in a given form.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-neutrality-with-respect-to-technical-literacy">The Principle of Neutrality with Respect to Technical Literacy.</h2>
<p>Consider sociologist Matthew Desmond’s website, <a href="http://evictionlab.org/">Eviction Lab</a>, which currently serves data on local eviction rates to members of the public, directly feeding local housing campaigns, but also providing a solid stream of data to journalists and legislators via the site’s API. Desmond’s web portal is friendly, we might say, in the sense of serving data within a sparsely-designed interface, set to a map of the United States; users can zoom into any locality, and explore rates of eviction and demographics for that site, as well as comparing one site to others. The portal delivers information; the cleaner the interface, the easier to use, and the more attention the portal attracts.</p>
<p>Friendliness is thus a function of obscurity, in a sense: more accessible than a monograph or scholarly journal, the portal obscures expertise; there are no footnotes or citations and few allusions to other organizations. One dimension of this friendliness is the obscuring of other forms of infrastructure – the many organizations whose work contributed to the gathering of the data; the many organizations at work, some of which initially complained at a lack of acknowledgement from Eviction Lab <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Indeed, as we have seen, one function of infrastructure is frequently its invisibility: the cables that carry data across the ocean are submerged; users of libraries rarely consider the labor and investments that created those institutions. Yet obscurity is not the only function of friendly design; rather, a clean and legible design also serves the function of inviting participation.</p>
<p>Friendly design tempts users to investigate a dataset or tool according to their own peculiar motivations, which have only been anticipated by the interface’s designer in a general way. Indeed, one aspect of the accessibility of web portals is to obscure many of the acts of accreditation and comparison that are typical of journal footnotes and published monographs, explaining the conclusions that a scholar came to on the basis of data. Instead, in Eviction Lab, the user is invited to make their own comparisons between any two geographical entities, examining rates of eviction, poverty and race between a given city and the rest of the state where it is located.</p>
<p>Another dimension of the seeming accessibility of the data is thus that the uses presented to the public are potentially open-ended: the scholar who shares data about rent, city-by-city, cannot know the political ends to which arguments about that data will be put. Data about rents is interpreted in one way by advocates of the free market and another way by advocates of welfare services; but without facts to argue about, the discussion is won merely by the fact of identification with an ideology, and thus by authority, rather than discourse, debate, and reason.</p>
<p>Faith in the  <em>process</em>  of such a discourse to produce understanding, particularly when all players have access to original texts, is part of the legacy of the enlightenment. Indeed, encouraging contemporary people to engage the shared reality of the past – to interpret it and come to understanding on their own, to begin to understand the present in relationship to shared historical experience, however naively at first – is surely part of the core duty of scholars and universities. Builders can limit the extent to which users of topic models or other abstractions can away from historical truth by linking visualizations back to the original text – a strategy we discussed in the Principle of Transparency – such that a debate on social media might occur that took the form of a series of refutations grounded in precise arguments about what to make of particular passages of texts.</p>
<p>In the humanities, it is possible that certain scholars experience an aversion to the principle of sharing learned documents beyond the sacrosanct borders of those initiated into the elite habits of hermeneutics and historiography. An anecdote shared by one scholar/builder suggests that a grant to release a public topic model of Jefferson’s correspondence was crushed, at one point, by a reviewer who feared that political forces in the public would demonize Jefferson on account of topics that referred to slaves.</p>
<p>Sharing the tools of abstracting and contextualizing arguments in their original context is surely part of the process of helping the public to perceive the past as accessible and a source of reason or rational debate to begin with: it is tools that can be argued about, linked to original passages of text, that can prove to naïve readers that the past is something about which rational arguments can be had, where arguments about the past have to be backed up by reasonable citations of an authoritative text stream. Engaging the tools doesn’t relinquish the battle over interpretation; rather, it moves the battle of interpretation out of the arcane world of footnotes, into a world of (preferably transparent) graphs and passages of text that any literate person can begin to understand. I shall return to this question of how tools help contemporary societies to establish a shared understanding of their past and present in the discussion of a later section, the Principle of Creating Knowledge About the Social World.</p>
<p>Today, portals such as  <em>Philologic</em> ,  <em>Topic Explorer</em> ,  <em>Voyant</em>  and  <em>Palladio</em>  make readily available a graphic user interface for documents brought in by the user, wrought out of precious seasons of user-testing the redesign, with the purpose of delivering a tool easy to use to those with no training. Single-archive portals such as the  <em>Old Bailey</em>  offer multiple transformations so that a user can explore the history of court cases by gender, crime, name, and other archive-supplied variables. All of these tools aim on bringing the facility and nimbleness of code to a base of users whose priority is research, rather than mastery of the architecture of coding.</p>
<p>In 2010-2, I worked on a similar piece of infrastructure –  <em>Paper Machines</em>  – which could be embedded within the existing Zotero portal for storing documents, allowing users to generate word clouds and other visualizations for the pdf’s organized on their computer. Our starting assumptions with  <em>Paper Machines</em>  departed from a moment when most scholars in the humanities lacked the technical expertise to convert files from pdf to clean text. We anticipated that scholars would want to harness the tools of aggregating information across thousands of the pdf’s that each of us already had on our desktops, and that Google Books had just made available in enormous numbers. In order to accomplish this, scholars would need access to highly interoperable tools. By the nature of the community in which I was embedded, any tool I worked on necessarily needed to bring insights to a plurality of scholars who worked on a range of topics, periods, languages and nations, who possessed a range of technical proficiencies from ample to extremely limited. Such an imagined user base underscored the importance of working with existing infrastructure, of transparency and usability as values. The idea is to present a low bar of technical literacy with the end of enabling all users – regardless of their background – to replicate a scholarly analysis, or to run their own.</p>
<p>In the case of our work, it was vital that  <em>Paper Machines</em>  serve the largest number of users with the smallest technological interventions to produce an easy transformation of the data into visual form, organized so as to be as convenient as possible to novices. It was intended to be facile and transparent, easily installed and easily opened.</p>
<p>Extended beyond  <em>Paper Machines</em> , this principle raises questions about the design of library and museum catalogues, national newspaper collections and archives of political debates, and indeed any collection of archives whose user base includes a general public which may not be literate. If the institution wishes to justify itself to a public taxpayer-base, to create transparency about national history or the nature of its political system, then builders of humanities infrastructure must follow the precepts of user interface design to enable the movement from question to analysis through a transparent, largely visual interface.</p>
<p>Indeed, the barriers to technological literacy may be more vast than the infrastructure itself. As Miriam Posner has argued, barriers may be institutional and cultural rather than defined by software. Successful digital humanities centers typically require a great deal of independence from university administration — as well as support — in order to provision researchers with the tools of committed research <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-the-primacy-of-pattern-recognition">The Principle of the Primacy of Pattern Recognition.</h2>
<p>Today, the designers of algorithms can borrow from an immense assortment of possible clustering algorithms from Machine Learning and statistics. It is not clear, in all cases, how the transformation of language encoded in these processes are applicable to humanities concerns. Put simply, pattern recognition is the coin of the realm of the humanities and social sciences, structuring insights from linguistics, history, archaeology, sociology, and political science, since at least the age of Ernst Cassirer.</p>
<p>In the design of Paper Machines, algorithms were chosen that would foreground pattern recognition and make available insights to which scholars could give their assent – on the basis of relatively easy-to-explain insights from computer science. My graduate school education coincided with the linguistic turn in British history, and my first point of orientation to the digital humanities was the possibility of measuring language as an index of political change. Another basic orientation was that we would foreground forms of analysis that already replicated, insofar as possible, the sorting and pattern-recognition functions of ordinary scholars of cultural, social, or political language.</p>
<p>Establishing and foregrounding the patterns being measured in a text has a clear benefit: it underscores examples of human behavior that other observers can easily recognize, grounded in facts that can be shown to correlate with the analysis. For this reason, pattern recognition is the gold standard of analysis in the humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>For this reason, likewise, drawing attention to cultural patterns has transformative potential because it directly relates analysis to fact. Inspired by the overwhelming power of cultural criticism based in patterns, digital humanities students at Berkeley addressed the #blacklivesmatter movement by creating an Online Hate Index (OHI) that would recognize patterns in twitter and social media <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Such a tool, in theory, has transformative political potential as much as any Frankfurt School analysis of culture, on the same principle: that enlightenment can be tagged to self-conscious reflexivity about cultural phenomena, and that awakening, therefore, can be harnessed to the recognition and analysis of patterns.</p>
<p>Not every online archive necessarily helps readers to navigate by using visualizations that foreground repeated patterns in the text. Earlier schools of infrastructure design – for example, many hyperlinked scholarly editions, web-born exhibits of art history, and keyword-searchable web repositories too numerous to mention – simply delivered text or visualizations to the user, one list or item at a time.</p>
<p>The skills of rendering insights from repeated patterns are associated with the school of Cultural Analytics, especially publications in the  <em>Journal of Cultural Analytics</em> , which has begun, in recent years, to harvest the most successful examples of pattern-recognition aided by advances in statistics and machine learning <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. The natural next expression of the methods laid out in these journal articles – which count, for example, named subjects by gender and race, or identify words associated with gender and race, or cluster documents temporally – is for those toolsets to be made usable by the public through the design of portals that would harness the full capability of our present knowledge of pattern-recognition.</p>
<p>To foreground the tools that draw attention to patterns based on repeated use of words – from basic keyword-counting to named entity extraction to topic modeling – reduces the technological intervention to something grounded in theories familiar to scholars of language such as Wittgenstein, Cassirer, Laswell, Austin, Skinner, Koselleck, and their heirs. A pattern-recognition toolkit is relatively transparent to users with respect to its possible uses and implications. At the same time, insisting on the primacy of pattern recognition must not come into conflict with the reality of the plural desires of humanists.</p>
<p>For those insights to be useable, and to garner consent, it is not enough that the types of analysis used be composed of concepts familiar to humanists and social scientists; they must also be replicable.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-replicability">The Principle of Replicability.</h2>
<p>A concept introduced in another article in this issue, the pipeline promise that the results of working with any given text base can be generalized. A term borrowed from computer science, the pipeline suggests a structure that enables the transformation of data through particular modules, each of which is completed before the next takes over. Conceptually, describing the way that a particular data visualization was produced through a pipeline underscores the need to transparently document the choices that comprise any particular approach to data. Sharing a pipeline, in the form of open data or open-source code, means being fully transparent about how a scholar arrived at a particular conclusion. Sharing pipelines also opens the gates to constructive scholarly critique, for instance, inviting other scholars to run the same code on the same data, but with a different cleaning algorithm or clustering equation, to see how different the results might be.</p>
<p>Scholarly journals in the humanities have begun to make this kind of sharing possible by adopting relationships with existing infrastructure that supports the sharing of code and data alongside shared ideas and visualizations. For instance, the  <em>Journal of Cultural Analytics</em>  asks authors to contribute their data and code to the Harvard Dataverse, an existing open-source infrastructure that allows a user to share and label datasets and code so that they are transparent and findable. The  <em>Hansard Topic Relevance Identifier</em> ,  <em>HaToRI</em> , discussed in another essay in the same issue of  <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em>  – aspires to the pipeline concept documented here, where every choice in the production of an analysis is documented, and any choice can be questioned, with the result of producing different material.</p>
<p>Sharing pipelines encourages inter-disciplinary, inter-temporal, and inter-national replication of results, comparison, and extrapolation. A pipeline designed around the Hansard debates for Great Britain can be plugged into the EU debates, the debates of the American congress or NYC council, with the same transformations executed on the same infrastructure.</p>
<p>Building infrastructure in this way makes good on the promise typically ascribed to critical theory in the humanities and social sciences since the era of Hegel and Marx, where comparisons of social phenomena from diverse places and times can be rendered understandable and compared in aggregate. Infrastructure designed to work only with a single group of texts does not do this, but infrastructure that is interoperable with a great range of material in theory allows vast comparisons and contrasts that will enable the next generation of social theorists, theorists of literature, and theorists of society to draw the generalizations that will structure our knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>Eve Kraicer, Andrew Piper and other scholars are pursuing an intellectual agenda in the design of code pipelines that make possible the critical reading of gender, class, and race in large-scale bodies of texts <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Their work differs from traditional endeavors, of course, in that it is replicable – that is, the body of code that Kraicer and Piper apply to American best-selling novels since the 1970s can, with the adjustment of perhaps five lines of code, be applied to Victorian novels or Renaissance broadsides, assuming clean data has already been prepared.</p>
<p>Potential replicability is underscored where scholars share actual code – or create a web portal that allows a body of code to be applied texts supplied by the scholar. A scholarly body of code, such as historian Lincoln Mullen’s textreuse, a toolset for comparing large bodies of text, opens doors for further scholarship, thus matching in significance works of critical theory, potentially rendering Mullen a contemporary Bourdieu. In  <em>InPho Topic Explorer</em> , philosopher Colin Allen provides an interface where scholars can submit any body of text to topic modeling, thus allowing humanists and social scientists access to a preferred tool for the machine-enabled clustering of documents.</p>
<p>Drawing attention to the wealth of postcolonial projects in the space of the digital humanities, Roopika Risam has underscored the way that digital technology allows scholars not merely to assert, but to replicate a critique of empire through the assemblage of alternative archives. Reviewing numerous examples, she shows how scholars have created and share alternative archives that run in parallel to the maps, laws, censuses, and other documentation of empire. Only through building — not merely through scholarship — she reasons, can scholars truly challenge the dominance of the colonized voice <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Unlike a one-time publication, which might critique the official archive without enabling other scholars the tools of directly accessing more voices, infrastructure projects of this sort actively provide the work for a hundred or a thousand new research projects and student papers.</p>
<p>This potential replicability of a theory across data-sets represents the fulfillment of the universalizing principles of the humanities since Vico, that is, the desire to make sense of multiple times and places. At the same time, the critical theory impulses of Piper and his cohort also have crafted forms of code (such as vector analysis of gender-index words) that enable scholars to lift nuanced semantic differences from very diverse bodies of text. In other words, the skilled reader, addressing this material, should be able, with the help of critical infrastructure, to preserve and describe cultural nuances that differentiate one moment from another, peering with ever finer attention into the characteristics and tensions within a corpus.</p>
<p>I am not saying, of course, that different cultures will not require different infrastructures or different kinds of code. Scholars of Chinese history, for example, reaffirm that many forms of digital humanities pipelines developed for western texts – which, for instance, depend upon word order for grammatical understanding – would be misapplied to their field, even while forms of analysis that jettison word order – including semantic network analysis and topic modeling – appear to work fine. The promise of infrastructure to extend and replicate scholarly inquiry is clear; the limits of that promise need still to be worked out through many case studies and much experimentation.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-creating-knowledge-about-the-social-world">The Principle of Creating Knowledge About the Social World.</h2>
<p>An implied extension of a transparent document base is that documents are a reflection of a shared historical context that has a reality and permanence, even within opposing interpretations: Jefferson’s contemporaries might have argued about the tolerability of human slavery, but none would have contested that slavery was a contemporary reality of deep and persistent concern, structuring their economic and social world to a deep degree. A piece of infrastructure can be – in certain circumstances – a tool for generating assent. Through encouraging consensus around some insight into social or economic reality, pattern recognition can offer the basis for collective action. More than simply advising a critical point of view, infrastructure can provision citizens and movements with data that actually then becomes part of their work.</p>
<p>It is clear that the humanities and social sciences have a great deal to offer, on an interpretive level, to the public, beyond merely being purveyors of data. Philosophers and feminists from Hannah Arendt to Seyla Benhabib have long valorized the role of the humanities and social sciences in the public sphere, in particular citing its capacity to enliven critical thinking about contemporary discourses of politics and identity. Working in this tradition, many scholars are used to understanding critique and complication as aligned with a political critique of empire, politics, and exclusion. More recently, Rita Felski has argued that critique reaches its limit when the hermeneutics of suspicion is turned everywhere <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, and has urged scholars to remember their value as curators of memory, critics of politics, and composers of stories.</p>
<p>Inviting the public to inspect data for itself is an action that implies political consequences. Consider the political context that motivated historians David Eltis and Catherine Hall – both historians of slavery — have turned into builders of infrastructure, in the midst of British debates about remunerations for slavery. Such projects as these represent broadly the fact that scholars are using infrastructures for serving cultural and political artifacts to the public as a way of engaging, instructing, and facilitating further cycles of engagement by the public.</p>
<p>Their projects have granted the public access not only to a curated debates about the history of slavery, but also directly to massive troves of quantitative, spatial and economic data about the British slave trade (<a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org/">Slave Voyages</a>, <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs">The Legacies of British Slavery</a>). Of the two projects, it is Hall’s – the  “Legacies of British Slavery”  – that has perhaps most directly sought to create an epistemic bridge to contemporary discourse, insofar as they profile the continuing profits that Europeans have reaped as a result of legacies of the past.</p>
<p>Both portals did three things that critical essays cannot do: (1) They reduced the arguments over Britain’s involvement in the slave trade down to a single visualization. (2) Indirectly, they invited the public to view the data upon which the visualization was based for themselves, offering it in the agnostic guise of raw data rather than as a series of footnotes compiled by an expert in the service of a project. We might, of course, take issue with raw data in principle, agreeing with Johanna Drucker that all data is already cooked: but the public fascination with raw data remains. And both scholars implicitly took advantage of the public fascination with raw data to demonstrate, in their portals, the extent of data upon which their visualizations rest. (3) They made the data interoperable, allowing the public to test conclusions for themselves.</p>
<p>At the same time, other scholars reviewing those projects might raise questions about whether all examples are equally critical in the sense of how profound is the new perspective it offers on the past. A scholarly edition represents a critical intervention in Literary Studies and is celebrated when evidence is mustered to persuade readers of a dramatically new interpretation of a canonical text. Digital editions, like <a href="https://www.frankenbook.org/">   <em>Frankenbook</em>   </a>, the most recent digital edition of  <em>Frankenstein</em>  – an exemplars of the genre, built on several generations of digital edition work — would have to pass this test of critical interventions in order to attract the notice of some departments. Clearer examples of critical interventions where humanities and social sciences knowledge is used to create a radical break with present-day narratives of politics and identity include <a href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/volume/2/index">   <em>Torn Apart/Separados</em>   </a>, which documents child separations at detainment centers along the national border, providing users with data, visualizations, and a critical narrative. At the same time,  <em>Torn Apart</em>  ejects a critical humanistic perspective into materials in the public sphere.</p>
<p>In sociologist Matthew Desmond’s ethnography,  _Evicted _ , Desmond provides accounts of families in Milwaukee who faced eviction, and the resulting stress to savings, education, children, health, and jobs that resulted from their experience. In Desmond’s companion website,  <em>Eviction Lab</em> , he provides users across the United States with information about the rate of homelessness and eviction in their neighborhoods. The infrastructure offers insight into the local realities of neighborhoods outside the Rust Belt. Another companion website, <a href="https://justshelter.org/">   <em>JustShelter</em>   </a>, offers corridors to action by connecting users with organizations that advocate for housing rights.</p>
<p>Like Desmond’s  <em>Eviction Lab</em> ,  <em>Torn Apart</em>  offers the public an open-source databank that renders visible previously invisible patterns of expenditure and violence.  <em>Torn Apart</em>  thus creates a scholarly intervention in a realm that was previously little addressed by scholars, or if addressed, in such a partial way as to make less of an intervention than  <em>Torn Apart’s</em>  open-source databank. Rendering visible the invisible, and making accessible the previously inaccessible data of knowledge, such infrastructures as these attempt interventions that differ in content, scale, and power from other scholarly productions, and they are therefore deserving of special attention as models of criticality and engagement with the public sphere.</p>
<p>The social power of documents to create an informed consensus becomes evident in digital humanities portals that illuminate politically contested episodes of national history. In portals such as  <em>Slave Voyages</em>  and the  _Legacies of British Slavery _ site, historians of Britain have published, for the benefit of a wide public, the primary records and quantitative distillation of the history of persons enslaved by the modern west. The portals, by their design, offer members of the public, as well as other scholars, access to primary-source artifacts, original numbers, visualizations and maps, as well as critical interpretations that, for instance in the case of the Legacies project, link the historical record to present-day companies and families whose wealth was bound up with the trade.</p>
<p>In such a circumstance, where the material governed by a site is potentially political, the designers of infrastructure have an opportunity to thwart the logic of naysayerdom in the era of fake news by firmly circulating primary-source evidence to users. By providing direct links to the primary source material on which the analysis is based, the  <em>Legacies</em>  site all the more firmly asserts the possibility of a new consensus around the history of British slavery and its repercussions.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more important aspect of scholarly infrastructure as argument functions in the realm of a critical understanding of the potential audiences and points of access to scholarly data. In the age of peer-to-peer networking with humanities and social science data, new collaborations are possible that never could have been accomplished in the age of individual research in the archive, and many journalistic theories have sought to characterize the generative potential of hive mind or many-to-many learning (Shirky). More recent research, however, has emphasized that many-to-many discursive spaces online create echo chambers that can be deleterious to learning, feedback, or critical thinking (Nguyen).</p>
<p>Information flows of any kind may generate echo chambers. Social theory foregrounds the potential of any flow of information to either intensify power or undercut it. It suggests that the choices made in the construction of institutions and infrastructure determine whether the experience of information will create a cult-like experience of information – where outside information is met with suspicion – or whether new information, data, and expertise will be experienced as the essence of liberation.</p>
<p>It might appear, of course, that a principle that demands consensus about reality is one of top-down power exerted over the user base by the designers. Indeed, the principle of creating knowledge about the social world operates in tension with another principle: that of a plurality of humanistic desires.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-a-plurality-of-humanistic-desires">The Principle of a Plurality of Humanistic Desires.</h2>
<p>Yet another orientation was to imagine our potential users as a plural community with a diversity of desires and perspectives with regard to electronic archives. In designing  <em>Paper Machines</em>  for an imagined diverse public of my fellow researchers, I had no ambition of creating a specific tool that would understand documents; rather I would leave it to users to organize their documents into relevant categories – for example, comparing decades, authors, subject-matter, or genres of writing. Instead, the tool would only implement algorithms that would prosthetically extend the ordinary capabilities of scholars: generalizing about large bodies of text, enabling the researcher to develop new insights into the material. By designing an infrastructure with fairly humble goals, we would offer the services of these algorithms to researchers who had little time away from the archive to code.</p>
<p>This principle holds more instruction for institutions such as libraries, museums, and national archives that have a particular responsibility to a non-scholarly user base. If the infrastructure is supposed to serve the general public, it must be accessible and transparent to a general public, whose desires from the archive may be genealogical or political in a narrow sense, rather than a reflection of current scholarship. The tools at hand should enable the finding of more documents according to a plurality of desires.</p>
<p>Indeed, Joris van Zundert has lately underscored the limits of humanities infrastructure projects tailored to a single archive – and the need of tools to help scholars who deal with heterogenous data <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. The desire principle, in theory, would facilitate not only collective research programs but also individual trajectories of research within those archives – and across multiple archives. Zotero allows a user to collect documents from multiple databases, for instance gathering trials from the Old Bailey and books from Hathi Trust alongside pamphlets help on JSTOR. By working within Zotero,  _Paper Machines _  made room for such erratic document-gathering habits, and attempted to offer tools that would allow the researcher to generalize about the collection as a whole.</p>
<p>Once a scholar who used Zotero had collected her own archive,  <em>Paper Machines</em>  was designed to facilitate individual exploration and experimentation with as broad an array of tools as possible. By trying on different categories, researchers could summon algorithms to quantitatively interpret texts, in much the same way as researchers’ own imagination typically sorts texts into different categories by decade, genre, and theme. The researcher would thus be able to  <em>test</em>  her subjective assessment of different categories using the quantitative power of a tool. Quantitative testing, we assumed, might reveal the user’s subjective categories to be grounded in fact. Alternatively, it might destabilize the user’s categories and suggest other patterns, established by regular word order, that might complement or challenge the user’s assessments.</p>
<p>Through these operations, researchers could iteratively model sub-portions of a corpus. They could view a body of texts as if through different lenses, reorganizing the corpus into different subcategories, and comparing the perspective raised by these subcategories, for instance rapidly glancing at the perspective of the corpus organized by decades and that of the corpus organized by genres or themes. Similar design principles governed the University of Virginia’s  _Collex _ , designed to facilitate the collection and exhibition of a suite of documents gathered by a researcher according to his or her own research program; they continue to inform the design principles behind  <em>Omeka</em> , the go-to resource for narrating a public story grounded in well-annotated archival artifacts. Both tools allowed scholars to extrapolate their own language for analyzing cultural documents, providing basic annotations like maps or timelines to enhance the user’s capabilities of storytelling.</p>
<p>_Paper Machines _ and other analogues like  <em>Voyant</em>  and  <em>Cortext</em>  enhanced individual story-telling with the possibility of data analysis. They provide researchers with a to test different quantitative perspectives on the corpus, rapidly switching between the perspective enabled by two different mathematical models, for example word count and topic model.</p>
<p>Yet  <em>Paper Machines</em>  added one facet that the others lacked: because it was built in Zotero – a platform that allowed scholars to share collections of documents with each other –  _Paper Machines _  facilitated research on shared archives, where a group of scholars might agree about a subset of documents of interest, and then embark on different algorithmic approaches to understanding those documents. This zone of inquiry would take place between individual research on mass shared collections and individual research on individual collections, occupying what Paul Edwards might dub the intermediary scale of research infrastructure. It would make room for shared, sociable research desires to emerge – not merely on an individual or collective scale – but also within the space of micro-communities.</p>
<h2 id="the-critical-principles-of-scholarly-infrastructure">The Critical Principles of Scholarly Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Thus far, the principles have focused on the relationship between a non-technical user base and a technical process of transformation, although embracing the principles has, as has been shown, implications for the power of the digital humanities to redound onto critical theory and seed interventions across the disciplines. Another set of principles govern the relationship between users and the erudite nature of archives themselves; these principles are best understood within a review of writings about power dynamics and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The implicit power dynamics involved with supporting digital infrastructure within the university itself have been subject to inspection and critique for at least two decades. After all, as critics of modern technologies of communication have long understood, power is at work at each scale in an infrastructure system. As many scholars in what is now called  “critical infrastructure studies”  have shown, at each scale and within each part of the pipeline, choices in values can change what is implemented <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>). On a national scale, highway systems, water systems, and other infrastructure are designed with the desire with potential interest groups in mind: for example, water policy in early twentieth-century California shored up the advantages of large landholders by giving them privileged access to irrigation (Worster), while the design of eighteenth-century road networks in Britain and nineteenth-century land redistribution programs in America was designed to give economic access to small farmers and workers (Worster, Guldi, Foner). A choice of values – which either reinforce existing power dynamics or counteract them — is thus at work in the design of infrastructure at every level of scale.</p>
<p>Digital infrastructures play into the same dynamics: they redound power dynamics of rich and poor nations and rich and poor communities, experts and non-experts, by reinforcing existing differentials of access. On a global scale, internet infrastructure is effected by choices about internet providers, such as networks of physical cables that connect rich countries to the exclusion of the poor translate realpolitik into technology <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. On the geographical scale of each community, smart phones and GPS usage require some levels of literacy and other forms of expertise in order to be useful <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. What’s more, the choice to maintain or not to maintain structures the accessibility of infrastructure and its benefits <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>: as when local maintenance of water facilities, delayed in Michigan, results in working-class populations being poisoned, or when differential maintenance across Parisian neighborhoods results in a seamless experience for an elite minority and a degraded experience for the rest <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In creating digital infrastructures, the builders of web portals have opportunities to counteract these power differentials. Builders who favor the strategies of  “minimal computing”  put their websites within reach of citizens in the global south or poor neighborhoods who frequently must access the internet through second-rate connections <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Other builders of infrastructure have primarily conceived of themselves as designing the tools for the coming of another community beyond the imagination of the designers. For example, the activists who designed toolkits for participatory mapping in the 1970s and 1980s imagined that the toolsets they wove together would be used by communities for purposes beyond what the original activists could imagine: and indeed, put into action, the participatory maps came to be used for the purposes of monitoring pollution, redistributing land, and protecting indigenous property rights (Guldi). Just so, the historical function of Britain’s nineteenth-century road network cannot be entirely understood through the work of engineers, but only through the use of the network made by the road’s users – including Methodists, journeymen, and radicals – who used the roads to create communities sometimes antithetical to the capitalist and nation-building purposes imagined by the network’s designers <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. The power of relinquishing control over infrastructure often makes the infrastructure of comparatively long use and greater effectiveness overall.</p>
<p>Some scholars will resist a form of scholarly practice marked by the relinquishing of control. They may argue that the value of traditional scholarship reflects the scholar’s command of language, citation, and transparency of sources to elucidate what facts have been used and what argument is being made. Indeed, many scholarly infrastructure project support direct control over the transmission of bibliographic information. While a web-born scholarly edition of Mary Shelley’s  <em>Frankenstein</em> , for example, may offer a useful resource to the teachers of Victorian literature grounded in printed and manuscript archives, the web-born format almost entirely replicates the form of traditional scholarly editions – something entirely useful for the purposes of tenure and promotion. Similarly, carefully-annotated digital collections of historical documents such as  <em>Vistas: Visual Culture in Spanish America, 1520–1820</em>  (<a href="https://vistas.ace.fordham.edu/">https://vistas.ace.fordham.edu/</a>) represent the equivalent labor of an art history exhibition or heavily-researched book. In format, these tools differ very little from traditional scholarly publications in books, excepting the use of hyperlinks and the scale of their accessibility. Scholarly infrastructure with a traditional form may nevertheless be radical in terms of its content; both the edition of  <em>Frankenstein</em>  and  <em>Vistas</em>  open up important questions about gender and race. Not all authors of scholarly infrastructure make the relinquishing of control over their sources or the sources’ interpretation a feature of their design.</p>
<p>Projects that emphasize the critical use of infrastructure make at least some gesture towards the relinquishing of control, pointing towards the wider uses of the community. As such, they overlap with the final instance of the humanistic principles, the  “principle of a multiplicity of humanistic desires.”  Infrastructure of this kind resonates with participatory traditions in urban planning, where planners consult the local community about the best course of development in a particular neighborhood <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. There are, moreover, traditions of literature and philosophy where the relinquishing of control is the hallmark of utility. For Roland Barthes, one of the hallmarks  “writerly literature”  is that it can inspire multiple readings and uses in cultures far from its point of origin, and so  “make the reader no longer a consumer but a producer of the text”   <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. The creation of a meaningful infrastructure project is marked by the project’s ability to support the user’s active production of knowledge.</p>
<p>The principles outlined below investigate how scale of exposure is deliberately used by certain websites to place texts of data in the public realm, often marked by the relinquishing of control over the ends to which the later products are put. Frequently, infrastructure projects of this sort work towards the multiplication of projects well beyond those imagined or intended by the designers. This article’s conclusion will strive to understand what this multiplication implies for the work of scholarly infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-that-democratization-of-access-to-information-breeds-better-democracy">The Principle that Democratization of Access to Information Breeds Better Democracy.</h2>
<p>The experiments with infrastructure that press the principle of neutrality with respect to technical literacy to its furthest extent are those that underscore mass participation, and they come to us typically from science and technology studies – a discipline familiar with theories of how technologies define the limits of their own participation or exclusion. In Science and Technology Studies, researchers have experimented with radical infrastructures that extend the principle of technical accessibility past the archive and web application, into a physical infrastructure accessible even to individuals whose computer and internet access is limited. In his dissertation on formaldehyde in FEMA trailers, anthropologist Nicholas Shapiro worked with chemists to commission post cards that would test the formaldehyde content in the trailers’ walls, if occupants mailed the postcard to a testing facility <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. The paper infrastructure of chemical-sensitive postcards thus made chemical testing of pollution in the environment radically available to ordinary citizens, allowing occupants of the trailers to test their environment for noxious chemicals by themselves. Infrastructure projects such as these have pressed the bar of what it means to offer information directly to the public.</p>
<p>Early in the scholarly infrastructure turn, many designers of infrastructure believed that delivering data and stories via the web offered an opportunity to democratize access to both scholarship and primary sources. In 2008, Harvard historian Robert Darnton was already making the case for open access to the digitized books scanned by Google, Howard Rheingold’s article,  “Participative Pedagogy: For a Literacy of Literacies” , for example, argued for digital practices that broadened access to  “literacy” , broadly defined, with the end of teaching  “the ways people use knowledge and technology to create wealth, secure freedom, resist tyranny” . For Rheingold, this  “literacy of literacy”  was more important than teaching the how-to of particular kinds of code or technology; in essence, Rheingold was arguing that the age of the internet made more necessary the proliferation of engaged and critical readings of culture <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine a humanities infrastructure that mirrors’ Shapiro’s postcards in bringing the knowledge of the university radically to bear for communities in need, but some archivists have begun to theorize the shape of such a project. At the Columbia University Library, Alex Gil’s <a href="https://nimbletents.github.io/"> <em>Nimble Tents</em> </a> creates digitization kits to help communities rebuilding after a natural disaster to map their resources. Gil has also created  “The Translation Toolkit” , another kit with which communities in impoverished neighborhoods and the developing world can record their own stories and send a copy to Columbia for preservation and translation – with the idea that recordings belong ultimately to the community, and that Columbia can aid communities in their analysis and documentation <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The elaborate series of scholarly articles introducing students to the Old Bailey archive (<a href="http://www.oldbailey.org">http://www.oldbailey.org</a>) expose students to themes of poverty, violence, gender, and race in Britain’s past. The website obviously holds the same merit as (at least one) traditional textbook, if not many more, by virtue of its carefully prepared archive and the many visualizations thereof: the main use of this part of the website is to expand the scale of potential readers who can potentially access these essays.</p>
<p>Consider  <em>EvictionLab</em> , which shares social science data about the demographic effects of eviction policies around the nation.  <em>EvictionaLab</em>  can be seen as complementary response to the social and economic critique of the harm served by eviction against families of color offered by Matt Desmond’s traditional scholarship, ethnographies published in the form of scholarly articles. The scale of harm that Desmond uncovered in eviction was a form of harm at scale. A critique – even a powerful one – barely approximates the scale of the harm that he discovered.</p>
<p>Becoming a builder of infrastructure allowed Desmond to deploy his research at scale. By creating a public portal that could answer to a multiplicity of local demands for information about the local face of eviction, Desmond was able to offer a level of detail that would be hard to rival in a traditional book or article. In a sense, the act of building allowed Desmond to enact a remedy of an appropriate scale for facing the trouble that he had elsewhere critiqued. Thus while critique illuminates our knowledge of harm, the limited effectiveness of critique hampers it: infrastructure-building, by contrast, in the form of data portal’s like Desmond’s, is a form of scholarly activity that activates a critique at scale, demonstrating the relevance of an economic critique to geographical locales.</p>
<p>The era of scholarly infrastructure has thus begun to forge a fundamentally new idiom of scholarly communication, one where the intellectual labor of critique can be married to the possibility of broad application at scale. The proposed equivalence is ethical in nature: a deep harm, which scales to the level of billions of families, requires a remedy that can travel further than a single well-cited journal article. Deep harm requires a remedy at scale: potentially, a remedy at scale also therefore requires not critique alone but also data infrastructure.</p>
<p>In many cases, by using scale and relinquishing control over the uses of data, infrastructure invites broadcast participation in arguments over social facts and public documents. In so doing, infrastructure does the work that many scholarly essays, for reasons of their small audience, often simply cannot do: elevating a political critique into the public sphere.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-community-ownership">The Principle of Community Ownership.</h2>
<p>In an article elsewhere, I have argued for the relevance to social science and the humanities of citizen science and other movements that collect and analyze data. For scholars pursuing the history of rent and eviction, for instance, the labor of an individual scholar is dwarfed by the scale of research imaginable if members of the public took up a scholarly charge to begin collecting data about the history of rent prices, rent laws, and eviction rates in every city around the world. To be sure, scholarly acceptance of such a crowdsourced database would depend upon adhering to the foundational principle of transparency, as well as existing standards for the documentation of the provenance of a document <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. The payoff of building avenues towards crowdsourced knowledge, however, would be an undertaking of research that would dwarf contemporary undertakings in its scale and potential for insight. A truly global program of insight would result.</p>
<p>Critical theory has long recognized the existence of principles of democratic participation against which initiatives and organizations can be measured. In 1968, Sheri Arnstein’s  “ladder of citizen participation”  arranged different forms of information sharing in the public sphere on a hierarchy of democracy, ranging from manipulation and therapy on one extreme to the devolution of power at the most democratic. Arstein’s theory underscored the power dynamics in information flows from government experts to the people, and raised the possibility of new kinds of citizen-governed institutions, a move that reflected current concerns of African-American populations in American cities, but mirrored radical ideas about governance going back at least to the era of the Paris Commune <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. This early theory of power and democracy in political information offers a pattern for understanding the radical potential of scholarly information on the internet.</p>
<p>Today, examples of citizen science abound, where users contribute observations, insights or desires, which are exchanged over a community-run infrastructure. Science and technology theorists have often critiqued the first generation of citizen science for the lack of discursive engagement with a program of observation laid out by experts: citizens were mobilized to count birds, to cite one famous example, but not to raise critical questions about how or why existing climate science had failed to be taken up in American public discourse.</p>
<p>There is enormous variation in whom different portals allow to play and how. The  <em>Legacies of British Slavery</em>  project makes data available to users, but stops short of allowing users to shape their own inquiries, holding tight to the overall interpretation of the moment in what may be informed by a concern for preserving the sacrosanct authority of interpretation at a time of rising ethnic nationalism. <a href="http://evictionlab.org/">   <em>Eviction Lab</em>   </a> gives away the data, allowing users to make what they will of demographics and instances of families ejected from their homes. The <a href="https://github.com/dbamman/book-nlp">   <em>BookNLP</em>   </a> software package allows users to isolate variations in the handling of gender, but lacks a public portal (as of now) that would allow a tech-illiterate user to engage such an analysis. Each of these decisions results from a complex of ideas about the scholar’s role, the expertise of their intended audience, whether scholarly production serves purposes outside the academy, and what the scholar’s relationship to that public is or ought to be. Those decisions are, by nature, philosophical, political, and professional; they are also subject to critical debate.</p>
<p>Outside the academy, communities are transforming science into the practice of citizen science by realizing Arnstein’s principle of participation and community ownership. For example, the organization Public Lab hosts  “Research Notes”  where community members like social scientist Nicholas Shapiro post requests for technical expertise – in Shapiro’s case, requesting help with the technical end of formaldehyde testing. In another online community, a community of small farmers called  <em>FarmHack</em>  shares blueprints for appropriate technology to make small-scale farming more economically viable. But experiments of this kind are less common in the digital humanities.</p>
<p>Humanists who share the values of democracy would be well-advised to consider whether the practice of citizen science has its place in the interpretation of text: for example, whether ordinary citizens require the tools of inspecting, via distant reading, the congressional or parliamentary debates of their own government.</p>
<h2 id="the-labor-of-infrastructure-building">The Labor of Infrastructure Building</h2>
<p>In the foregoing sections, I have surveyed a range of possible values expressed by the builders of scholarly infrastructure. A proposition of this kind is important because the intellectual engagement of infrastructure-builders with critical thought has not always been self-evident to outsiders.</p>
<p>Understanding value as a factor in the kind of work embodied by scholarly infrastructure projects – including the bibliographic, critical, political values represented by engaging in project-building as opposed to traditional scholarly documentation in the form of books and articles – is crucial to having those projects accepted and interpreted as interventions in the realm of scholarship, where critical commentary routinely engages the kind of intellectual values represented by a project and the way that data, visualizations, and other forms of labor support those values. Understanding the range of possible values underlying those commitments is therefore crucial, as communities and scholars come to terms with the stake of committing energy to infrastructure-building rather than to traditional scholarship products such as grants and articles.</p>
<p>The metaphors that I have offered above – comparing scholarly infrastructure to an opera house – are also productive in a number of directions that cannot be exhausted in the course of this article, especially involving the question of where labor or ideological contributions occur. Panning out from the opera and opera-house itself, one can see any given production of  <em>Aida</em>  is itself the product of architect, composer and librettist, conductor, and cast. A reader-centric interpretation even pushes this list to include the audience in the theater on any given night, and their manifold interpretations of the opera <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Just so, the work of digital production and interpretation includes all of those forms of invisible infrastructure that include scanning and cleaning texts, storing and serving them, before the design of the infrastructure; the infrastructure itself, any scholarly articles whose interpretive approach depends on the infrastructure in question, and any individual users of the infrastructure, whether or not they later become authors of analyses published in traditional academic venues.</p>
<p>The multiple locations of labor and interpretation in such a process constellate a broader transition to a hermeneutic regime of information at scale. Elsewhere, I have argued that shifts of this kind are marked by a deferment of  “critical thinking” , where insight is produced at a single point of interpretation and argumentation with the text, into a processes of  “critical search” , where critical engagement is required over the entire length of an information pipeline <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Appreciation for the values implicit in scholarly infrastructure has not always been the tone by which digital scholarship is received by larger communities in the university. In one inflammatory editorial in the  <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em> , a scholar characterized the digital humanities as being the tool of the neoliberal takeover of the university and an ally in the adjunctification of the professoriate <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. In at least one tenure process with which the author is familiar, a department threatened to stage a kind of inquisitorial panel to monitor a digital humanist already published in traditional books and articles, because engagement with digital humanities and social sciences question – including building infrastructure – was understood as somehow sullying the life of the mind with the dirty matter of service.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>
<p>The remedy for this failure is debate and conversation that theorizes what it is that people do when they build infrastructure, and at what stages scholarly discourse, humanistic discourse, technological acumen, dissent, and political thought enter the process. Scholars who think critically about infrastructure must advertise their critical engagement in the form of a scholarly essay that reflects on the format of the infrastructure adopted and its implications.</p>
<p>In teasing apart the range of values represented by modern infrastructure, I have argued that infrastructure building implies, at minimum, a commitment on the part of the scholar to scale and a relinquishing of  <em>control</em> , which imply a choice of values, including a set of traditional values, such as transparency with regards to document base and the knowledge of society, which are aligned with long-standing commitments in the humanities and social sciences, and critical values, such as participation and the critique of power, which are aligned with radical traditions in the academy and beyond.</p>
<p>Recognizing the choice values at stake in building infrastructure is essential, I believe, to understanding much of the work in the digital humanities and social sciences as well as other parts of the university today: there is something on offer that has not been illuminated in the voluminous literature on infrastructure, digital humanities, or the crisis of the humanities, which deserves to be recognized, praised, critiqued, and pressed, because it presents a challenge to contemporary practices of scholarship, and scholarly communities must decide whether that challenge is worth embracing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this-offering-and-why-has-it-been-so-submerged">What is this offering, and why has it been so submerged?</h2>
<p>On the surface, infrastructure represents a different species of animal from the scholarly article, whether single-authored or authored by many individuals. In some cases, like Andrew Goldstone’s <a href="https://agoldst.github.io/dfr-browser/demo/">   <em>Topic Viewer</em>   </a>, they are the creation of a single individual, but the individual’s responsibilities include using code to who cobble together existing packages for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, as well as scholarly insight about the kinds of cleaning, analysis, and visualization likely to produce insight from texts of a particular type. These designs thus resemble scholarly articles or narratives in that they provide users with an orientation to the data, based on wide experience; but they also resemble cartography or traditional kinds of data analysis in that they entail working with vast amounts of evidence to produce visualizations useful to different parties for different reasons. As a monument of scholarly labor and insight, the building of infrastructure typically represents a major scholarly intervention – entailing more labor than that included in the typical journal article in the humanities or social sciences. It bears the weight of a book.</p>
<p>In many cases, the committees that assign credit to academics for publishing books and articles resist crediting the development of software with the same power on the basis of the  <em>plurality</em>  of labor represented by the creation of an infrastructural project. Infrastructure often represents the product of collaborations, where labs of scholars and students, or hybrids of scholars working with university staff and/or private contractors, produce the design for the project and its execution. It can, after all, be difficult to isolate the contribution of a single party working on a project <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Typically, in these collaborative labs, coders and scholars collaborate to design a visual and interpretive strategy that governs how users interact with the data. The end product reflects ongoing collaborations, much as an edited book may be conceived of and rallied by a single scholar but may represent the work of many hands.</p>
<p>In some of the most highly-developed web portals that serve humanists, the infrastructure requires ongoing updates managed by graduate students, salaried coders, full-time staff, and administrators, whose tasks may range from insuring interoperability with users’ machines to managing lawsuits (for instance in the famous case in which Thomson-Reuters sued Zotero. In any case, the range of labor provided – from coding and design to data collection, cleaning, analysis, and more – is more diverse than the traditional scholarly processes of archival research, analysis, and writing, even where facaulty act mainly in an administrative or visionary role rather than producing code themselves. Overseeing the development of infrastructurerequires the scholars involved to conceive of their arguments in visual terms, and to produce multiple visualizations that align with different perspectives on the data in question.</p>
<p>Yet the plurality of labor necessary to realize infrastructure is only part of the story of why the university community is sometimes hostile towards infrastructure projects. A turn towards personal autobiography will be useful here. As a scholar of the history of infrastructure who researched eighteenth-century road building and wayfinding through traditional archival means, I came to the digital humanities primarily as a researcher interested in how keyword search was changing my own techniques of research. Initially, I resisted the idea of building infrastructure, preferring to think of myself exclusively as an author of books and articles and a consumer of tools developed by others.</p>
<p>The flowering of new tools in the digital humanities – the  “infrastructure turn”  identified by Geoffrey Rockwell (2010) — persuaded me that scholars with active the gap between existing tools for annotation, curation, and story-telling – such as  <em>Zotero</em>  and  <em>Omeka</em>  – and the array of text-mining and visualization practices coming into being from computer science. Some of those projects were created by affiliates of research universities such as George Mason, which had a firm commitment to building infrastructure, and whose graduates were distinguished by their knowledge of servers and code. Others were the work of senior faculty, who had already built a career composed of multiple books, who turned to building infrastructure at an advanced stage in their career when they could command a multi-year research project to build an infrastructure around an infrastructure of particular interest to themselves and their students. Admiration for those accomplishments made me question archival research as the sole expression of scholarly research and argumentation, and opened the door for my curiosity about infrastructure-building.</p>
<p>In 2010, I began writing grants and talking to colleagues about the possibility of building an infrastructure for the digital humanities and social sciences. I imagined that building a tool that would distill scholarly knowledge into frequently-repeated patterns, extending the scholar’s power of recognizing patterns over tens of thousands or millions of documents, and thus acting as a kind of scholarly prosthesis. Working in research-focused departments nevertheless forced me to reconcile my admiration for scholarly infrastructure with my own needs, as well as the needs of my students and colleagues – all of us, of course, being researchers at first-tier research programs, who were incentivized above all to discover new outlooks on the past, whether from archivally-new materials or from a new perspective on events already known but insufficiently understood. It was hard to imagine a single tool that would serve this purpose. The graduate students who I worked with at Chicago had extremely diverse research backgrounds and interests – ranging from early-modern Germany, to modern Latin America and nineteenth-century Chicago. The tool that would serve my research-focused students would necessarily need to work with documents of concern to them all, using existing language-processing algorithms and visualizations to offer insight into documents of different kinds. Thus it was important to build a tool that would allow researchers invested in text from a range of backgrounds to profit from the tools of word-count analysis and topic modeling then being used by a handful of scholars in the digital humanities.</p>
<p>Many examples mark how senior scholars skeptical of digital methods have held up the career of junior scholars — even those who have otherwise fulfilled traditional requirements for tenure — and this certainly seems to be the case for builders of infrastructure. Such affairs undermine the progress of the field, as one anecdote will illustrate. Consider the case of a scholar, known to me, whose interest in digital methods had led her — after finishing a traditional monograph in her field — to build a piece of digital infrastructure also publish a treatise investigating the future of her field with respect to the digital humanities When she did so, she was punished by her department.</p>
<p>The grounds for tenure laid out at her hiring were reversed; she was ordered to write a third book on a traditional, archival topic that was ordained by her committee, and it was conveyed to her that the department was outright hostile to her continued use of digital methods. Far from recognizing the value of a piece of infrastructure developed by a junior scholar, her department counted infrastructure as an albatross for her career.</p>
<p>In the vita that she had submitted to her committee for tenure, this scholar could count several accomplishments unusual for historians, including the aforementioned infrastructure, as well as a significant grant. Following the advice of colleagues in other departments, this scholar circulated a draft in which the infrastructure and grant-related projects were classified under a heading of  “book weight projects” . Her committee recommended that she remove the infrastructure project to a section on  “miscellaneous projects” . The message to her was clear: infrastructure would not be valued alongside books and articles as a marker of scholarly labor, intellectual value, or theory-driven critique. The double-binds that this individual faced – resistance to the digital humanities, resistance to infrastructure-building, and few incentives to document the critical thinking behind existing infrastructure experimentation — amounted to an incentive for delay. She delayed writing further about infrastructure, in part, because the culture of resistance she faced meant that even this kind of scholarly commentary on experimentation would itself be rendered suspect by tenure review committees by the same hostility that the article needed to challenge.</p>
<p>Things might have gone otherwise for the individual and infrastructure in question, of course, had there been intellectual apparatus that considered the development of infrastructure as a form of scholarship, infused with the values of critique: her investments of time might have been viewed as a viable form of scholarship and a valuable investment in future forms of scholarly community, rather than a dangerous action inappropriate for junior faculty. The problem was essentially that investments in scholarly infrastructure were obscure from the point-of-view of existing scholarly institutions; they could be seen neither as a form of scholarly argumentation, nor as a critical reflection on contemporary scholarly practice. In order for that resistance to give way, scholars would need to document the history, debate, and values out of which new experiments with infrastructure were emerging.</p>
<p>Institutional resistance to a culture of experimentation, however, is a wicked problem, in that no one solution is sufficient to overcome it: a single major publication is rarely sufficient to shift a culture. In my own career, I began to develop such a justification for scholarly infrastructure projects in my second book,  <em>The History Manifesto</em> , which set forward the promise of tools like topic modeling for opening up longue-durée analysis of problems to historical analysis.</p>
<p>Failure to recognize or support infrastructure as a scholarly achievement has consequences. Today, the infrastructure in the story is no longer maintained — a fact that highlights the differentials of commitment between senior faculty and junior faculty. As with the train system in the Parisian suburbs, junior faculty projects unprotected by senior administrators are liable to be refused maintenance and so degrade. I delayed writing explicitly about infrastructure as scholarly production and intellectual critique. Very few articles reflect on the process of building or state a case for the role of argumentation and thought in infrastructure design; there was very little, in 2013 and 2014, to point to by way of a firmly-established  “infrastructure turn”  that would be acceptable to senior historians. Indeed, at 2019, this essay offers a much-delayed assessment of the role of critical thinking in the design of  <em>Paper Machines</em>  in 2009-13.</p>
<p>The double-binds that I faced in 2014 — resistance to the digital humanities, resistance to infrastructure-building, and few incentives to document the critical thinking behind existing infrastructure experimentation — amounted to an incentive for delay. After initial hostility to the broad-brushstrokes with which we praised the potential of the digital humanities in the  <em>Manifesto</em> , I delayed writing further about infrastructure, in part, because the culture of resistance I faced meant that even this kind of scholarly commentary on experimentation would itself be rendered suspect in tenure review committees by the same hostility that the article needed to challenge.</p>
<p>We might refer to a culture that resists innovation, because the terms that inspire innovation are obscure and hostility is rife, as a culture of delay.</p>
<p>My own partial and much-delayed engagement with these problems may be symptomatic of larger failures of acknowledgement for the builders of scholarly infrastructure, as well as our own hesitance to explain our values. Scholars who have come to make major investments of time and energy in building infrastructure rarely justify those projects in scholarly or public venues, perhaps because the intellectual labor behind the work or the time dedicated to infrastructure projects is likely to be dismissed, and the labor judged with hostility. The failure of institutions to recognize or reward scholarly infrastructure compounds almost certainly compounds scholars’ slowness to highlight the intellectual values or merit expressed by their infrastructure building projects.</p>
<p>I therefore propose that the remedy for culture of delay is, ironically, more theory: theory in the service of illuminating the alignments that compel some scholars to experiment with building and sharing infrastructure at scale. The builders of infrastructure need to theorize openly about the choices they have made and the values that those choices represent. The foregoing principles have been offered for the sake of waymarking out some broad and familiar territory, but future theorists of scholarly infrastructure will necessarily have to take up the challenge of setting up their own waymarkers, or arguing with and thus refining the extremely preliminary terms in which I have framed values such as community ownership or transparency. In that process of scholarly debate, a trail of references will be created that will familiarize critical thinking about infrastructure for mainstream communities of scholars.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-the-work-of-scholarly-infrastructure-projects">Conclusion: The Work of Scholarly Infrastructure Projects</h2>
<p>What sort of work, then, is the labor that goes into a humanistic web site? This article has already suggested that the principles governing that academic labor reflect not only bibliographic and scholarly traditions, but also discourse from critical theory about the liberatory potential of knowledge and participatory research. A strong argument has thus just been made for infrastructure-building, in the humanities, as a site of intellectual argumentation, so long as the process of designing and building the infrastructure entails some moment of reflection upon the principles that governed its design and their inspiration (which need not, of course, replicate the principles outlined here).</p>
<p>Clear though the argument may be for critical reflections on infrastructure as a form of scholarly argument, some account must be given of why so little critical discourse exists on the building of digital humanities projects of this kind.</p>
<p>This article has proposed nine criteria of critical thinking about infrastructure demonstrated in mainstream projects which demonstrate an engagement by the designers with ideas about the humanities. Two of those criteria – those I have labeled critical principles – demonstrate that scholarly infrastructure embodies political and argumentative work prized by some scholars, for example, those concerned with the defense of democracy, or the radicalization of community access to knowledge. Projects that demonstrate these criteria show that the designers have actively prepared the infrastructure so as to engage with the concerns of their discipline, and building, under these concerns, represents an act of engaged criticism and argument. Many of what I have called the bibliographic principles also demonstrate an engagement with critical thinking, and also with the political insights of social theory, in the form of an engagement with infrastructure as a tool of power. Infrastructure projects that demonstrate these both criteria suggest that practitioners have not only engaged with the concerns of their discipline, but with the critical theory of the last half-century as well, particularly as translated through the social/historical infrastructure turn and its critique of the infrastructure of knowledge-making.</p>
<p>In other words, the realization of the critical principles in acts of scholarly development demonstrate that a wide variety of infrastructure-builders are actively engaging a wide-ranging critique of the institutions of knowledge and their political power. Here, scholarly engagement and argumentation are taken to an extreme largely unknown in the traditional disciplines. A double infrastructure turn – combining social insight and technological building – is at work, which merits the inspection of scholars across the academy. Infrastructure building is the present-day site of engagement with the insights about power and governmentality that defined the scholarly infrastructure turn.</p>
