Along with his colleague Thomas Kurtz and a few work-study students at Dartmouth College, Kemeny had developed the BASIC programming language and Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS), both of which went live on May 1, 1964. BASIC and DTSS represented perhaps the earliest successful attempt at programming for all, combining English-language vocabulary (e.g.,
HELLO instead of
LOGON ), simple yet robust instructions, and near-realtime access to a mainframe computer.</description></item><item><title>Computational art Explorations of Linguistic Possibility Spaces: comparative translingual close readings of Daniel C.

The algorithm at the heart of the work continually computes the minimum number of substitutions required to transform each valid English word into the next, deriving a near infinite number of combinations of words and phrases, letter-by-letter, substitution-by-substitution.</description></item><item><title>Nonsense Code: A Nonmaterial Performance</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000702/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Barry Rountree, William Condee</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000702/</guid><description>1.

An esolang (a portmanteau of esoteric and language) is not designed to solve practical issues, even esoteric ones. Instead, esolangs ask the programmer to puzzle through counterintuitive rules that challenge them or invite reflection on the act of programming.
In their refusal of practical use, esolangs are primarily cultural objects. Apart from this, they can seem at first glance to have little else in common.</description></item><item><title>Tracing Toxicity Through Code: Towards a Method of Explainability and Interpretability in Software</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000706/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>David M.

We see this, for example, in challenges to facial recognition technologies, public unease with algorithmic judicial systems and other automated decision systems. There have been new regulatory attempts to capture some of the ideas that stem from explainability such as the Algorithmic Accountability Act 2022 in the US, and the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) in the European Union.</description></item><item><title>ᐊᒐᐦᑭᐯᐦᐃᑲᓇ ᒫᒥᑐᓀᔨᐦᐃᒋᑲᓂᐦᑳᓂᕽ | acahkipehikana mâmitoneyihicikanihkânihk | Programming with Cree# and Ancestral Code: Nehiyawewin Spirit Markings in an Artificial Brain</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000699/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Jon Corbett</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000699/</guid><description>Introduction Nohkompan,1 my paternal grandmother, was Nehiyaw (Cree) and Saulteaux (Chippewa).

More to the point, how can we trust that algorithms and related technologies do not have a detrimental effect? As technologies make up more of our digital environment, they not only provide tools for thought, but they also shape and direct the very way we think. The move from relying on books to understand a topic to using the internet to research a topic is profoundly different, not only in terms of the acceleration in access to information, but also in the reliance on surfing and searching for information.</description></item><item><title>The Politics of Tools</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000690/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Stephen Ramsay</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000690/</guid><description>Zilu said, If the ruler of Wei were to entrust you with governance of his state, what would be your first priority?

Confucius, Analects To speak of the politics of tools is to take the political nature of technology for granted, and rightfully so. If the generation of historians, literary critics, sociolinguistis, and philosophers who came up in the academy after Foucault are united by anything, it is the idea that most things are wrapped up in issues of power, and therefore cannot be said to stand outside the realm of the political in any way.</description></item><item><title>Tool criticism in practice.

Although empirical research trends have existed throughout the history of the humanities 1, these recently emergent possibilities have revived an empiricist attitude among some humanities scholars schooled in more critical and interpretive traditions.</description></item><item><title>How to Do Things with Deep Learning Code</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000684/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Minh Hua, Rita Raley</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000684/</guid><description>Screen capture from This Word Does Not Exist 1.

Even apart from OpenAI’s already-notorious ChatGPT, or a Google engineer’s claim of sentience for its conversational model, the reporting on research advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) almost inevitably cultivates some degree of alarm and auratic mystery. Some of this affect is generalizable to the field of artificial intelligence, which continues to be overcoded as a dangerous and impenetrable black box.</description></item><item><title>SEDES: Metrical Position in Greek Hexameter</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000675/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Stephen A.
