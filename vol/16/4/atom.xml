<p>Annotations are ubiquitous in research in the digital humanities and beyond and have been declared a “scholarly primitive” by Unsworth. By this, he refers tobasic functions common to scholarly activity across disciplines, over time, and independent of theoretical orientation<a class="footnote-ref" href="#unsworth2000"> [unsworth2000] </a>. Julia Nantke and Frederik Schlupkothen have set out to further deepen our understanding of annotation and foster interdisciplinary exchange on what annotation is and can be. To that end, they organized an interdisciplinary conference held at the University of Wuppertal, Germany, in February 2019. The conference was called <em>Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization</em> and its results were published in a volume by the same name<a class="footnote-ref" href="#nantke2020"> [nantke2020] </a>.</p>
<p>The introduction to the volume by Nantke/Schlupkothen is in itself worth mentioning: to give a comprehensive overview of the 16 articles without reducing them to one aspect only, they provide several visualizations of the volume’s content using the articles’ keywords. A word cloud shows which keywords are the most popular, a similarity matrix displays which articles combine to thematic clusters and an edge bundling visualization gives easy access to information on which articles share which keywords. The latter unfolds its full usefulness only in the interactive version that can be found on the publisher’s website (De Gruyter):<a href="https://cloud.newsletter.degruyter.com/annotations/">https://cloud.newsletter.degruyter.com/annotations/</a>. This review, in contrast, must force the articles back into the linearity of the medium of text. The guiding principle of the following is to question both what the authors mean by the multifaceted termannotationand whether they approach it from a primarily theoretical or applied perspective.</p>
<p>First, some articles focus on analysis of annotations that have already been done by someone else and are now the object of study. Freedman extends the understanding of annotations to footnotes in academic texts and traces that type of textual expression back to its origins in the 17th century. For Bamert, annotations are handwritten marginal notes in books for which he coins the termpen traces(Stiftspuren). That term allows one to include non-verbal forms like underlinings and stresses the materiality of such annotations. Through the example of pen traces made by Thomas Mann found in books in his estate, Bamert shows that four types of knowledge need to be included in the analysis of such annotations. Most evident is the importance of knowledge of the text and the reader: readers might underline or comment on passages where they learn something from the text that they did not know before. However, the notes by Thomas Mann also document his critical stance towards the author of the text, who seems to willingly modify his interpretations to conform with National Socialist ideology. Therefore, Bamert argues, the knowledge of the author as well as of the historical context need to be involved in the interpretation of such annotations.</p>
<p>While in these examples, the annotations analyzed have been done previous to the research, most articles in the volume deal with annotations that are produced at some point in the research process. One focus, as indicated in the title, is on annotations in the context of digital editions. In a digital edition, many different types of annotations can arise. Schlupkothen/Schmidt suggest a systematic distinction between commentaries (Kommentare) and explanatory notes (Erläuterungen), two terms that have often been used synonymously. While commentaries refer to the form of the text and editorial decisions related to it, explanatory notes offer additional information regarding the text’s content and thus ensure understandability. Fanta presents the edition of the estate of the author Robert Musil, which holds special challenges for the editors: the high number of documents are interrelated in many ways that echo Musil’s writing process. Such process is reflected in a high number of comments, revisions, and explicit references to other documents by the author himself, making it possible to trace how different preliminary works lead to later, more elaborate documents. Fanta shows how the edition attempts to capture all these relations in TEI/XML. Sciuto shares lessons learned from the digital edition of the work of the French philosopher d’Holbach. He discusses the problem of how to target different audiences with one edition and proposes a two-level annotation system for this purpose. Koolen/Boot approach the topic from a more technical and infrastructural angle: for many editions, it would be desirable to allow for annotation by third-party users on the edition’s website and, where useful, publish them for other users. They discuss difficulties that result from the HTML presentation of the edition and propose a solution based on semantic web technology.</p>
<p>Five further articles consider annotation in a different sense as the application of analytical categories to an object of study by researchers. Lang reports on the semi-automatic annotation of alchemical code names (Decknamen) with a thesaurus. Alchemical texts often refer to substances via their code names which are usually unfamiliar to modern readers and should therefore by accompanied by additional information. Lück aims at an analysis of philosophical texts with respect to the examples used and, as a first step, needs to identify examples in the texts. He exploits the fact that many examples are explicitly marked as such (with text strings like <em>e.g.</em> or <em>for instance</em> ) and uses these as a starting point for the heuristic identification of further candidates. The contribution by Reiter/Willand/Gius is about the annotation of narrative levels in literature. Noteworthy is that they approached this task by adapting the format of a Shared Task from computational linguistics and asked the research community to contribute annotation guidelines, test them empirically in a competitive setting, and engage in discussion about them. In a second part of the Shared Task, the aim is the development of a system for the automatic detection of narrative levels. The article by Drummond/Wildfeuer stands out by the fact that they tackle multimodal annotation. They investigate contemporary American TV series with respect to gender differences in representation of characters. Annotation categories capture aspects like camera perspective, sound design, how active the characters are and many more. Overall, female characters are displayed as in weaker positions.</p>
<p>Another group of articles focuses on annotation as a process and tools for its support. McCarty shares his thoughts on general note making in the research process and considers them a cognitive tool not only for writing down thoughts but for developing them in the first place. He stresses how the choice for a specific tool – be it digital or analogue – impacts our thinking and calls for a thorough study of annotation practices and their embedding in context prior to software development. Lange contributes empirical data on the annotation of research articles by scholars. To this end, he analyses public annotations by researchers in the online journal eLifeScience.com, which allows readers to annotate with the help of the Hypothes.is plug-in. In comparison to what we know about private note making, he finds that most annotations were clearly written (or rewritten) with publication in mind. Horstmann follows up on questions of tool development by presenting the annotation tool CATMA (Computer Assisted Text Markup and Analysis). CATMA supports close reading practices like highlighting and manual annotation as well as quantitative analysis of its annotations and automatic annotation of some phenomena. This way, Horstmann argues, the tool can contribute to building bridges between traditional literary scholars and digital humanists.</p>
<p>Finally, some articles primarily address theoretical aspects of annotation. Hinzmann revisits the concept of the hermeneutic circle. Despite the term’s popularity, it is not precisely defined and used for many different understandings of this concept. Hinzmann suggests a differentiation of several circular relationships that are involved in annotation and interpretation: 1) The interplay of part and whole of a text or corpus in the sense that interpretation of a part is influenced by knowledge of the whole and vice versa, 2) the interplay of individual annotation categories, the category system as a whole, and its theoretical foundation, 3) the interplay of the object’s historicity and systematic categories of modern research, and 4) the interplay of induction (bottom-up) and deduction (top-down) in research processes. That suggestion is to be welcomed and communication in and beyond the digital humanities could profit greatly from more explicitness as to which understanding of hermeneutic circle is being referred to. Franken/Koch/Zinsmeister look at the different functions that annotations can fulfill in a research process. To this end, they compare typical uses of annotations in computational linguistics and cultural anthropology. One major difference is that computational linguistics predominantly works with pre-defined category systems which are then applied to data while cultural anthropology follows methods of grounded theory and develops the annotation categories in the annotation process itself. Rehm offers various reflections on annotation from the perspective of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. Among others, he provides a list ofdimensionsby which annotations can be systematically described (e. g. research question, annotators, guidelines, complexity and evaluation).</p>
<p>Overall, the volume gives a very broad and inspiring insight into what can be considered annotation, what role in the research process annotation can play, and in what contexts and with which tools annotation as a practice takes place today. With regard to Unsworth’s [<a href="#unsworth2000">2000</a>]scholarly primitive,the multitude of phenomena and approaches sometimes makes it difficult to see the primitive that they are all supposed to share.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> An abstraction of all understandings of annotation could result in a formula like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> _A_ adds information _B_ to object _C_ in mode _D_ with purpose _E_ .
</code></pre><p>This formula provides a grid for a structured discussion of different types of annotations, depending on how the variables are filled. As for A, the role of the annotator is either fulfilled by the researcher (as in most papers in the volume) or by some other scholar or author that is the object of study (academic writers in Freedman, Thomas Mann in Bamert). Fanta combines both types as the edition involves annotations by Robert Musil, but also their representation in the edition. For automatic annotation, the computer can be considered another type of annotator, even though its application is, of course, driven by a researcher. For the type of information (B) encoded in annotations, possibilities are essentially unlimited and as free as research itself, as the volume impressively illustrates. Of course, some categories can be more easily mapped to an annotation scheme or are even standardized, while others are more difficult to pin down at text surface (see Franken/Koch/Zinsmeister). Note that while the text is the most common object of annotation (C) in the book and beyond, annotation can be applied to other research objects as well, like movies in Drummond/Wildfeuer. Also, the annotation oftextholds its ambiguities, e.g. whether the text is considered in its materiality or not. The mode of annotation (D), in a technical sense, can be divided in analogue and digital approaches, the former constituting the vast majority for annotations created today (with the exception of personal note-taking, as in McCarty). A further differentiation can be made among the digital approaches by looking at annotation formats like XML (Fanta and others), HTML (Koolen/Boot) and TCF (Lück) and tools like CATMA (Horstmann) or ELAN (Drummond/Wildfeuer). Finally, annotations can be described by their purpose (E) which is also dependent on the addressee of the annotations. Purposes of annotations in the volume range from personal notes the author addresses to themself (Bamert, McCarty), analytical categories that are subsequently analyzed (Lang, Hinzmann, Reiter/Willand/Gius, and others), and annotations that are directed at a third-party reader like other researchers (Lange) or the reader of an edition (Schlupkothen/Schmidt, Sciuto). Some annotations are primarily addressed to the computer that maps the annotations to specific forms of visualization (typically) on the screen.</p>
<p>In highly interdisciplinary contexts like the digital humanities, communication can be challenging. On an abstract level, we will oftentimes agree that we all “do annotation” and thus regard it a scholarly primitive. However, concrete practices differ substantially and what a computational linguist and a historian have in mind when they say “annotation” might have less in common than both of them expect. A description model like the simple formula proposed here enables systematic discussions about concepts of annotation. Grounded in a solid understanding of commonalities and differences, multiple approaches to annotation can benefit greatly from confrontation with each other. In this way, annotation as a shared practice can foster interdisciplinary exchange. The volume by Julia Nantke and Frederik Schlupkothen is an impressive example of how the focus on an abstract practice like annotation allows various research endeavors to find parallels in their work.</p>

<p>On April 14, 2003, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, a collaborative project in the United States between the National Human Genome Research Institute and the Department of Energy, announced the successful completion of the Human Genome Project. It entailed developing a complete sequence of the Human Genome, a task made possible by 800 interconnected Compaq Alpha-based computers performing 250 billion sequence comparisons an hour<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bergeron2004"> [bergeron2004] </a>. The torrent of data produced by the project not only revealed the incredible complexity animating human life but also and more importantly, demonstrated how machinic systems could be used to both reveal and even reverse engineer the patterns and trends driving such large data sets, giving humanity an almost god-like power over nature. As President Bill Clinton announced: “Today we are learning the language in which God created life. We are gaining ever more awe for the complexity, the beauty, the wonder of God’s most divine and sacred gift. With this profound new knowledge, humankind is on the verge of gaining immense new power to heal” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#newyorktimes2000"> [newyorktimes2000] </a>. Thus began the era now known asbig dataand with it the assumption that the analysis of large data sets would allow humanity to reveal and fundamentally alter the patterns and trends driving the natural world. Nearly two decades after the Genome Project’s success, the promise of big data, however, seems more like a nightmare. In her new book <em>Discriminating Data: Correlation, Neighborhoods, and the New Politics of Recognition</em> , Wendy Hui Kyong Chun delves into this nightmare and argues that heightened polarization during the era of big data is not an error or flaw within the system<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chun2021"> [chun2021] </a>. Rather, Chun makes the argument that discrimination is in fact big data’s primary product.</p>
<h2 id="correlating-the-data">Correlating the Data</h2>
<p>As with Chun’s previous contributions, <em>Control and Freedom</em> (2008), <em>Programmed Visions</em> (2011), and <em>Updating to Remain the Same</em> (2017), Chun investigates a fundamental paradox and contradictory tension at the heart of new digital technologies. Machine learning algorithms are often marketed as free from human bias and prejudice, yet they simultaneously encode segregation into the very logic by which they promise to reverse engineer life. As Chun explains, “We need to understand how machine learning and other algorithms have been embedded with human prejudice and discrimination, not simply at the level of data, but also at the levels of procedure, prediction, and logic” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#chun2021"> [chun2021] </a>. Prejudice then is not a problem that results from human error, but it structures the basic logic animating our machinic systems.</p>
<p>The monograph’s argument unfolds around four foundational concepts in computing: correlation, homophily, authenticity and recognition. Correlation remains among the most crucial concepts undergirding nearly every aspect of existing AI systems. According to Chun, correlation is not just a conceptual category, but it constitutes an everyday practice whereby people are lumped into “categories based on their being like one another amplifying the effects of historical inequalities” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#chun2021"> [chun2021] </a>. These inequalities are in turn naturalized with data organization systems making it appear as though they are innate orsui generiscategories which already preexist in the world. As Chun warns, “correlation contains within it the seeds of manipulation, segregation and misrepresentation” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#chun2021"> [chun2021] </a>. As a result of their reliance on correlation, social networks createmicroidentitiesby default which instrumentalize and weaponize individual differences. Data analytics consequently reimagines eugenics discourses within a big data future where correlations are not only assumed to be predictive of future outcomes, but surveillance is assumed to be a necessary component of every human institution and one which will allow humanity to improve nearly every component of daily life.</p>
<p>All three other foundational concepts are conceptually linked to correlation. Homophily, for example, plays a crucial role in naturalizing correlations, making likeness seem like an obvious and innate way to group and organize data. The assumption that people gravitate toward things that are like them consequently becomes “a tool for discovering bias while simultaneously perpetuating those very biases in the name of comfort, predictability, and common sense” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#chun2021"> [chun2021] </a>. Chun in turn stresses how the very feeling of comfort which homophily generates naturalizes these acts of discrimination. Like homophily, authenticity has become automated in that authentication of one’s identity within systems of validation are assumed to be a necessary and nonnegotiable component of digitization. Before you log in, you must authenticate yourself and essentially prove yourself to be real. Algorithmic authenticity is rarely if ever challenged. Instead, we are “trained to be transparent” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#chun2021"> [chun2021] </a>. Finally, recognition makes discrimination possible, since it encompasses the process whereby we come to accept someone or something’s status and authority as authentic.</p>
<h2 id="assessing-the-costs-of-algorithmic-performativity">Assessing the Costs of Algorithmic Performativity</h2>
<p>Although Chun’s four foundational concepts might organize all computational systems, they are ultimately dependent upon our performance of them. Throughout the monograph, Chun emphasizes that data analytics requires our performance of it, since it is only through our performance of the roles that data analytics assigns us that it comes to take on its meaning. Here, Chun makes the most significant and deeply troubling argument in the monograph. Through our active participation in it, data analytics transforms the world into a research laboratory where we are its main research subjects. The rhythms of life are consequently transformed into significant patterns that reveal some sort of deeper order that can be reconfigured to improve social outcomes. People who fail to follow their algorithmically-assigned roles are either dismissed as meaningless outliers or at worse categorized as deviant actors and subject to swift disciplinary action. However, deviance, as Chun warns, is also pre-scripted and performed, since the internet requires offensive and deviant content to hold people’s attention. Deviations are consequently the very way by which users come to be authenticated and clustered<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chun2021"> [chun2021] </a>.</p>
<p>For Chun, the transformation of society into an experimental lab is one which bears explicit similarities to one of the darkest and most troubling eras of human history: eugenics. While often dismissed as a relic of a bygone era in human history, eugenics is in fact increasingly coming to undergird contemporary institutions. From medicine to education, the assumption that people can be divided into certain groups based on certain perceived behavioral or assumed physical characteristics and then those groupings can be used to evaluate and predict future behaviors and outcomes is now the underlying logic which guides human decision-making and institutional structures. As Chun warns, “If twentieth-century eugenicists however defended their work against accusations that it experimented on humans, twenty-first-century data scientists openly embrace experimentation” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#chun2021"> [chun2021] </a>. Their unyielding belief in the inherent benevolent power of experimentation is why firms like Cambridge Analytica have been able to experiment on the public relatively free of oversight or regulatory pressures, despite the fact that the firm’s claim that they were able to predict and shape voting patterns in the 2016 election was never verified and no evidence was ever provided to verify their claims of success.</p>
<p>While Cambridge Analytica might have not been able to prove their claims, that has not stopped nor mitigated data metrics’ use in other fields such as medicine where the stakes of such reverse engineering experiments are particularly high. Postmarket surveillance, for example, was once a practice unique to digital technology companies but in recent years has become a standardized practice by which medical and pharmaceutical companies can expedite the lengthy and costly process of developing new drugs and increase their profitability. Chun echoes Olivia Banner’s cautionary tale about medicine’s increasing reliance on this practice in <em>Communicative Biocapitalism</em> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#banner2017"> [banner2017] </a>. Once relegated to decades of costly and lengthy trials, today new drugs are commonly studied only after they have been approved for the public, leading to drugs later being pulled from the market after causing significant and lasting damage to patients. The adverse effects of OxyContin, for example, were only discovered years after its approval to the general public. Such examples demonstrate how our growing faith in the power of big data analytics in fields such as medicine is ultimately predicated on our underlying faith that the benefits of experimentation always outweigh its potential costs.</p>
<h2 id="rethinking-the-role-of-the-digital-humanities">Rethinking the Role of the Digital Humanities</h2>
<p>Chun’s description of the apparent parallels between eugenics and big data surveillance mechanisms make the monograph a particularly important read for digital humanities scholars, particularly those who work in the digital medical or health humanities. In particular, Chun’s five-step program to counter data-informed discrimination and repair “the mistakes of our discriminatory past” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#chun2021"> [chun2021] </a>offers a possible set of responses for scholars interested in working toward more socially and culturally conscious ways of designing and working with machinic systems. According to Chun, being more socially and culturally conscious ultimately entails critical interrogation of the historical and political conditions which propel and inform the logic underlying our algorithms and data structures. This process of interrogation, however, hinges on embracing our moral responsibility in participating in these experiments.</p>
<p>As Hannah Arendt once argued, eugenics was able to find a home in German society, because it was so banal and deflected individual moral responsibility to institutional structures<a class="footnote-ref" href="#arendt1963"> [arendt1963] </a>. In the case of Nazi officers like Eichmann, Arendt explains that they deflected moral accountability for their active participation in the murder and torture of millions of people by claiming that they were just following administrative commands and orders from higher up. Yet, Arendt aptly explains that one’s moral responsibility only increases in such situations where you might not know the victim nor personally be the one who carried out the execution. Responding to Eichmann’s defense, the judgment of the court ruled “On the contrary in general the degree of responsibility increases as we draw further away from the man who uses the fatal instrument with his own hands” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#arendt1963"> [arendt1963] </a>. Likewise, are we just following the data? Put differently, if a decision is made on the basis of data metrics, who exactly bears moral responsibility for its outcomes?</p>
<p>Although machine learning and AI systems might have ushered in a new historical era constituted by the promise of reverse engineering social systems, this era is one which carries with it many of the same moral problems of the one that preceded it. Perhaps more is needed than just critical interrogation and awareness of the propensity for algorithms to reorganize social institutions around polarizing divides. Such new technological innovations reveal the need for a new moral system, one with the potential to hold individuals and organizations accountable for the outcomes of their digital experiments on social, political, and economic institutions. If board members and executives of a company were held morally responsible for the outcomes of their use and application of data metrics, would they be more likely to critically interrogate the assumptions behind those metrics? How exactly can scholars break up this synergistic nexus between the corporate boardroom, Congress, and laboratory?</p>
<p>Ultimately, Chun’s monograph exposes the urgency for more investment in the digital humanities, particularly when it comes to the study of ethics. As the digital humanities comes to define itself as a field, ethics must remain a nonnegotiable and fundamental component of the field’s central task and purpose. The development, creation, and implementation of a moral system which holds people accountable for the outcomes of their data metrics, modeling, and social experiments must take precedence in the field as the digital humanities works toward the development and application of more socially and culturally conscious ways of using and applying digital technologies. We might not know what those moral systems look like in practice today, but the field is already increasingly coalescing around critical assessments and interrogations of the material and human costs of digital technologies as awareness and evidence of digital media’s costs continues to accumulate. The era of big data might have given humanity god-like abilities, yet perhaps it is the task of the digital humanities to expose how those god-like powers have made us even more flawed and vulnerable than we were before.</p>

<p>In digital humanities it is common to study the change in use of a word in a corpus of text by means of vector semantics, or distributional semantics. The idea is to map word-types found in a text or in an entire corpus to vectors.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Each coordinate of the vector will represent an association with another word-type. An algorithm can be written to scour parts of text near the word-type for associations. The idea is that a word like, for example, &lsquo;food&rsquo; will automatically be associated with other words that tell us about the concept of food. Prominent examples of food, like &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; or &lsquo;bread&rsquo;, or near synonyms like &rsquo;nutrition&rsquo;, or biologically related organs like &lsquo;stomach&rsquo;. Such methods have at least the following advantages: first, they are fully automated, and hence, large corpora of text that could not realistically be studied manually can now be studied. Secondly, they can track homonymy, (near) synonymy and changes in the use of an investigated word, even as the word stays linguistically constant. Linguistically these methods are justified by the idea due to John Firth that “You shall know a word by the company it keeps” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#firth1957"> [firth1957] </a>. Firth, and somewhat synchronously, Zellig Harris, defended and developed the view that the verbal connotations of a word gave us important insight into its use, more so than any definition could do<a class="footnote-ref" href="#firth1957"> [firth1957] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#harris1964"> [harris1964] </a>. We need not go that far. To justify the idea of vector semantics we only need to believe that the distributional properties of a word give us some semantic insights into the word that are of interest to a purveyor of large corpora<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gavin2019"> [gavin2019] </a>.</p>
<p>However, this does not settle the exact details of our vector semantics. There are many different ways to calculate the exact values of each of the coordinates, and it is not clear which of these characterizations of the company of a word tells us what. Some people might assume that one or the other characterization gets us closer to a word’s meaning, to be expressed for example, by scoring higher or lower on pre-defined metrics. We will offer an alternative to this approach by arguing that different methods might give us different facets of meaning.</p>
<p>In this paper we look at two particular ways to turn the company of a word into vectors. One, where each word-type in a corpus is mapped to a number representing the frequency with which it occurs near another word-type relative to its overall frequency, and another where a word-type is associated with a list of high scoring words. Both of these methods find the &lsquo;company&rsquo; of a word in some way. However, we will claim, these results need not be the same for a given word-type. Hence, the main purpose of this paper is to offer an interpretation of what these different ways of specifying ‘the company&rsquo; tell us, so that an investigator can i) more easily choose between the two methods and ii) use them both next to each other profitably. Both of these goals constitute a novelty; i) depends on the interpretations of the methods as providing different (and not competing) facets of meaning (sec.2). By doing such analysis we are applying insight from recent innovations in the philosophy of language that have come to fall under the name of ‘conceptual engineering’, to the interpretation of language by algorithms. ii) is cashed out in a new method that measures the divergence of the two methods as a new semantic measure (sec.4) whose object has no counterpart in the literature. In order to interpret these methods we will examine their workings in detail.</p>
<p>In section 2, we draw on the work of philosophers like Sally Haslanger and Mark Wilson to argue that a word has salient, more publicly known and obvious semantic content as well as more subtle and hence less salient content. We will argue that both are important aspects of the semantics of a word. The subtle, less salient, content is usually understood as an ability to navigate subtleties which we cannot or would not make explicit. We will argue that our restricted-list method tracks the salient connotations whereas the unrestricted method tracks its more complete use, including hidden semantic subtleties.</p>
<p>In section 3 we need to dive into the technicalities of the methods discussed. We will show in detail the operational difference between measuring more and less salient semantic content. In addition we will introduce methods to measure the overall stability of word-meaning in a given corpus. Stability will be a measure of the similarity of word use across multiple texts. Lastly we will introduce our novel methodological proposal which we dub Salience Differentiated Stability, which is a two-vector signifying a word&rsquo;s relative salient and less salient stability. This is a metric that will be applicable to any given corpus of texts.</p>
<p>In section 4 we provide an interpretation of SDS-scores. A word can score high and low on both salient and non-salient stability. We give interpretations for all four possible cases.</p>
<p>Finally, in section 5, we provide the results of an explorative case study where the Salience Differentiated Stability of a small set of word-types in a corpus of 17th and 18th century physics/natural philosophy is measured and analyzed. This is not a history paper per se, but rather an examination of methodology. Hence, the purpose of this case study is not to study 17th century physics/natural philosophy. It is rather to see whether the methodology, which this paper is about, yields results that make prima facie sense and are non-trivial. They might be trivial if varying salience yielded no difference in results or none that could be plausibly interpreted. We will find in the case study that words which score high on salient stability, do not necessarily score high on subtle/less salient stability, or vice versa. This means that in actual historical examples, salient and less salient semantic content can be quite different both in content and in overall stability.</p>
<h2 id="section-2-salience">Section 2: Salience</h2>
<p>When it comes to vector semantics, there are different ways to code the algorithms that determine the semantic content of a word in a given body of text. We will look at two methods using PMI and vector embedding, where a word is characterized as a large vector, each of the coordinates in the vector signifying how often another word-type appears in close proximity to it. The number appearing in these coordinates is called the collocation score. So, if we are characterizing &lsquo;gravity&rsquo; and &lsquo;gravity&rsquo; and &lsquo;force&rsquo; often appear close to one another in a text, the coordinate signifying &lsquo;force&rsquo; will have a large number (see section 3 for the relevant math and coding). The main methodological choice we will be looking at is the following: when constructing a vector for a word we might decide to ignore all but the most extreme coordinates, that is, all but those words with the highest collocation scores, but we don&rsquo;t have to restrict our attention in this way. We could instead look at all of the coordinates in our vector. The question is: which of these ways of coding best captures the semantic content we want to capture. One way to answer this is by arguing that the meaning of a word is mostly determined by the words it is associated with most or alternatively, the way it is associated with all other word-types in the text. We believe both these answers can coexist in a way. In this section we will argue that there are different ways to conceive of the semantic content of a word that justify the use of different algorithms.</p>
<p>The idea of distinguishing different kinds of semantic analysis already exists in the work of feminist philosopher Sally Haslanger. In her <em>What Are We Talking About? The Semantics and Politics of Social Kinds</em> she distinguishes different forms of analysis that yield different facets of the meaning of the same word<a class="footnote-ref" href="#haslanger2012"> [haslanger2012] </a>). A conceptual analysis yields the manifest meaning, the way we (or for our purposes, perhaps not us, but some historical population) explicitly understand the meaning of a word. A descriptive analysis would yield the use of the word which might in fact diverge from the way we think we use it. Haslanger gives the example of her son’s primary school which makes use of a concept of tardiness. Officially, any child that arrives after 8:25 was tardy but as Haslanger&rsquo;s son pointed out: “Don’t worry Mom, no one is ever tardy on Wednesdays because my teacher doesn’t turn in the attendance sheet on Wednesday until after the first period” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#haslanger2012"> [haslanger2012] </a>. Here the use of &rsquo;tardy&rsquo; diverges from the official, explicit definition. Its manifest meaning, which you would have learned by asking the teachers or school staff what ‘tardy’ is, was not the operative meaning, which you learned from studying the tracking mechanism. Beyond this rather local example, Haslanger is thinking about concepts of race and gender, &lsquo;man&rsquo;, &lsquo;woman&rsquo;, &lsquo;white&rsquo;, &lsquo;black&rsquo;, etc. These concepts might superficially, or manifestly, be thought to refer to biological categories. For this reason we might argue that the whole concept of race is misguided since the underlying biological category either does not exist or is not nearly as pronounced as the word implies. However, there is also a de facto use of our race categories that deserves study – because even though the manifest meaning might turn out to be bogus, this does not mean these sorts of word are not still doing relevant and investigable semantic work, to be found by looking at the operative meaning<a class="footnote-ref" href="#haslanger2012"> [haslanger2012] </a>.</p>
<p>In his book <em>Wandering Significance</em> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#wilson2006"> [wilson2006] </a>Mark Wilson uses the concept of a façade to denote concepts that superficially seem univocal but on closer inspection have subtly divergent uses in different contexts<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wilson2006"> [wilson2006] </a>. A simple example is that of a rainbow<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wilson2006"> [wilson2006] </a>. In some contexts it makes sense to say a pot of gold is at the end of it, presumably to be reached by riding a unicorn over it. In other, more literal contexts, rainbows have no clear ends, and cannot be ridden.</p>
<p>A better, but more complicated example is that of hardness. Most of us have some notion what it is for a material to be hard, but upon inspection of the technical details, the concept reveals itself as something much more heterogeneous than it at first appears. Wilson notes that a range of different tests and metrics exist depending on what type of material specialists speak of and for what purpose. Some of these tests identify hardness with resistance to scratching or cutting and some of these metrics identify it with flow stress or a resistance to penetration. Wilson gives examples: “In these contexts [indenter tests for common metals], yield strength becomes the attribute to which “hardness” locally gravitates (although such identification is completely unnatural for glass)” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#wilson2006"> [wilson2006] </a>. As Wilson notes, not all of these tests even make sense for each type of material and for each purpose. Hence hardness relates to a range of local patches of meaning that are tied together by the vague general notion of hardness but are each individually quite different. The use of the concept admits of a lot of subtleties that are not apparent at face value, often because they only appear in exotic contexts or because different specialized contexts are usually kept separate. This means that we should expect the use of the concept to be more divergent than its most salient description. Another example is given by Thomas Kuhn<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kuhn2012"> [kuhn2012] </a>who argues that the well-known formula <em>F=ma</em> is applied quite differently in different branches of physics.</p>
<p>We agree with these authors on the following points: first that the use of a word is not always the same as the explicitly given definition or the first description of it that comes to mind. Secondly that the use of a word often has a lot more subtlety and divergence to it than we commonly give credit for. Thirdly that both the subtle uses of the word and its more salient, obvious meaning are of interest. We will use the notion of salience to distinguish greater and smaller degrees to which the meaning of a term will be public and obvious to its users (authors and readers). The idea is that the more extreme coordinates of our vectors will show us the more salient aspects of a word&rsquo;s meaning, whereas the smaller coordinates and the differences between them are still relevant to the way a word is broadly used, but not in a way that readily comes to mind even to those who use the word regularly. Unlike different types of meaning or analysis, salience will not be a binary division with salient and non-salient features but will admit of degrees. This suits our purposes because in the digital methods employed we will distinguish the salient from the not so salient by a continuous variable, occasionally using an unavoidably arbitrary cut-off point of a value above which word-relations will be considered salient. Hence, &lsquo;salient&rsquo; will be used much the same as &rsquo;large&rsquo;, supervening on an underlying property that varies continuously (size) and being only understandable in relative terms (large compared to a human is different from large compared to the sun).</p>
<h2 id="section-3-algorithm-implementation-and-details">Section 3: Algorithm implementation and details</h2>
<p>Our two methods for the extraction of semantic information about word-types from a corpus are the following: (1) extraction of lists of collocates and (2) generation of a vector-representation. We will first introduce the generation of a vector-representation of a word in a given text and then argue that extracting collocates is a specific restriction on this vector-representation that allows it to bring to the fore the more salient features of a word-type. Then the different ways of measuring similarity between word-types will be introduced and the particular application of our proposed algorithms for conducting our case-study. Two words are of the same word-type if they are spelled identically. We might consider grammatical cases of the same stem as identical as well, in which case the unit under discussion is a lemma rather than a word-type. Word-types are used throughout as the objects of study, however, for the case-study in Section. 5 we’ve lemmatized the texts and are thus looking at lemmas. However, the methods proposed are equally applicable to both types of object.</p>
<h2 id="vector-semantics">Vector semantics</h2>
<p>In accordance with Firth’s and Harris’ intuitions, the algorithm works by considering the contexts of word-types (by looking at what word-types surround them) and saving that data in a proper data-structure – meaning that word-types will be represented <em>as</em> the other words that they co-occur with and the counts of these co-occurrences. First we must get the base information we need from the texts. This is done by counting for every word-type which other words co-occur with them within some window of size n. Here n signifies the number of words that we look at on both sides of all the occurrences of the word-type investigated. This means that if we for example choose a window of size 4, and consider the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The movement towards digital hermeneutics is fraught with difficulties, but movement is never without difficulties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can derive a representation of this sentence in terms of relative closeness of word-types. There are 12 different word-types in the text. For each word-type we can ask how often each word-type occurs (given a particular windowsize). In table 1 below you can see what values this would deliver (the first column shows how many occurrences of the word-type (WT) occur in total):<br>
Example of construction of a table of all co-occurrence vectors#WTThemovementtowardsDigitalhermeneuticsisfraughtwithdifficultiesbutneverwithout1The1111100000002Movement1211121121111Towards1111111000001Digital1111111100001Hermeneutics1111111110002Is0211111232111Fraught0111111111001With0101121111002Difficulties0200131111211But0100021111111Never0100010021111Without010001001111<br>
This is a vector-representation of the contextual information in the text. Each of the rows is a vector (i.e. there is a vector for each word-type) in a 12-dimensional space. Every individual number in the table represents how often the column word co-occurs with the row word. Important to note is that the windowsize directly impacts the nature of the results of the vector-representation of the text – in our experiment in section 5, we use a windowsize of 10. There is a strong case to be made that taking different values for the windowsize can in many ways be used to extract not better or lesser results, but properly different results from the text.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>However, these raw counts are, on their own, not particularly informative. They need to be transformed so that we can extract values that indicate how strongly two word-types are connected that is not directly influenced by the total occurrences of certain word-types. We see in the above table for example that ‘movement’, ‘is’, and ‘difficulties’ all have higher total co-occurrence counts than the other words – a direct consequence of their own higher frequency. However, it is not so that by occurring more often, a word-type is necessarily more connected to more types of words in interesting or salient ways. This means we need to transform these raw counts-scores into a score that is unaffected by total frequency of word-types. For this we have used and will now introduce the measurepointwise mutual information.</p>
<h2 id="measuring-pmi">Measuring: PMI</h2>
<p>Each of the pairs of word-types needs to be scored – or, their connectedness needs to be measured – based on the data from Table 1. The way to do this is by extracting the data about the number of times they have co-occurred, together with how many instances of the word-type there were. The method we will be using to do this isPointwise Mutual Information(PMI).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> PMI measures the chance of finding a word-type <em>y</em> within a window around another word-type <em>x</em> (within a chosen windowsize) in the investigated text, divided by the chance of finding y in the whole text. The idea is that related words should be found disproportionately in each other’s windows<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> . The overall chance of finding <em>y</em> indicates a regular proportion. We take the log of this value in order to make the results better suited for vector calculus later. We will write small <em>x</em> for the set of instances of x itself and capital <em>X</em> for the windows around instances of <em>x</em> . Notice that the different windows <em>X</em> might overlap. In this case the same word-token will be counted twice or more. Hence <em>X</em> should be seen as the disjoint or indexed union of the windows. The formula for PMI reads:</p>
<p>PMIx,y=log2Py∈XP(y)</p>
<p>This provides us with the average of the chance of finding a token of <em>y</em> in a window near a token of <em>x</em> , divided by the overall chance of finding <em>y</em> in the text. The fraction can only be a positive value (both denominator and numerator are positive), but a log of a value between 0 and 1 gives a negative value. If the two word-types are fully independent from each other, we’d see that there is no difference in the chance of finding <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> in window-proximity to each other in our actual text, versus the hypothetical situation where they have no actual relation – i.e. the fraction will then give as a result 1. <em>Log(1) = 0</em> , so PMI scores above 0 should be read as indicating a positive correlation between the two word-types in the text, whereas scores below 0 indicate negative correlation, and 0 itself indicates independence.</p>
<p>Computationally the chance <em>P(y)</em> is simply the instances of <em>y</em> divided by the total word count. The chance Py∈Xis found by counting each instance of <em>y</em> within the window of an instance of <em>x</em> , where the same <em>y</em> may be counted more than once when it appears in more than one window, divided by the size of the disjoint union <em>X</em> of all the windows, which will always be the window size multiplied by the amount of times <em>x</em> appears in the text.</p>
<p>py∈XPy=|yfoundinwindowsaroundx||x|*windowsize|y|Totalwords</p>
<p>So for example, when we consider table 1 above, we can see that the score for PMI(is, with) with a window size of four is given by the fact that we find ‘with’ around ‘is’ twice, that ‘is’ occurs twice itself, that ‘with’ occurs once and that the entire text consists of 15 words, giving us:</p>
<p>log222*4115=0.250.0667=3.75</p>
<p>When the corpus is only a single sentence, this method does not yet pick up on any significant semantic properties – but as we will see later on, when the number of sentences and words, grow, this problem diminishes.</p>
<h2 id="divergence-extracting-collocations-and-the-salient">Divergence: extracting collocations and the salient</h2>
<p>From this vector-representation of a word with scores based on PMI, there are (at least) two routes available for the extraction of different meaning-representations. We argue that one discovers more salient aspects of meaning, whereas the other discovers the more subtle/less salient aspects of meaning.</p>
<p>Many of the scores inside the vector representation are low. The connectedness of the terms is there, but not particularly salient. Specifically within the approach that is calledthe extraction of collocations, this intuition is put to good use. Collocates to a specific word are those words that areparticularly connectedto the word that is being investigated. Instead of looking at 100.000 word-types and their connectedness to a word of interest, in these cases, one restricts the list to those word-types that score at least a certain score on the PMI measure. This often leaves investigators with a handful, up to a ~100 word-types, which together provide a good overview of the interesting semantic properties of the word-type under investigation.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> In our own algorithm, we have taken the threshold to be a PMI-score of 4, so as to mimic these applications, which often aim to consider around a few dozen of word-types for an investigated word-type.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>We argue that what investigators making use of lists of collocates are extracting are those connections between word-types that are (within the investigated corpus) particularly salient, and by extension, more public and explicit. This works well for their purposes. The list of high scoring words will mostly include words that, to a reader of, or author in, the corpus, will likely ‘make immediate sense’ when provided. Of course, the nature of the connection won’t be provided, but that they are connected will be clear on most occasions to most people who read the corpus – and looking at this limited set of words can provide an investigator with a lot of useful information on the corpus.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the vector representation. Here the meaning of a word-type is not given by a list of <em>x</em> particularly saliently connected words, but by the PMI score with every single other word-type contained in the corpus. In addition, instead of taking an implicit ‘one-hot’ representation as in the collocation extraction (another word-type either is, or is not, connected enough) the vector representation typically takes the exact outcome of the PMI calculation as its score. This means that even minute differences will play a role in the differentiation between different word-types. What we are picking up on here, we argue, are the more hidden, less explicit, connections a word-type makes within the corpus. It investigates how the particular ways of using a term influence further usage and application of a term, despite it being particularly hard for a speaker or reader to explicate that such a causally productive connection exists.</p>
<p>We have suggested that PMI scores track relevant semantic properties of a word. In addition, that high scores track more salient features, and low scores more implicit and subtle features. What argument or evidence is there for this? Perhaps the use of a word is part of its meaning but surely what other words it appears near in written text is at best an approximation of how the word is used.</p>
<p>Psychological research shows that PMI is positively correlated with judgment of similarity, that is to say if words have higher PMI scores in sample texts then test-subjects are more likely to judge them similar<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcdonald2000"> [mcdonald2000] </a>. In addition, texts with high PMI scores for given word pairs have been shown to make people see the words as more related in meaning<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcdonald2001"> [mcdonald2001] </a>. In addition, as McDonald points out, such scores can be correlated with other psychological variables such as effect in lexical priming<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lowe2000"> [lowe2000] </a>, analogous reasoning<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ramscar2000"> [ramscar2000] </a>and synonym selection<a class="footnote-ref" href="#landauer1997"> [landauer1997] </a>.</p>
<p>This shows that whatever properties are tracked by PMI are not mere artifacts of the texts studied but have at least some correlation with psychological indicators of word meaning. What does not follow from this work is that lower PMI scores indicate less salient aspects of the use of a word. That would, by its very nature, be hard to extract from straightforward questions to test subjects, though it might be studied in other ways. In section 5 we will include results from an explorative case study that show that in at least some cases, looking at just the high scoring words yields different results from looking at all word associations.</p>
<h2 id="similarity-measures">Similarity measures</h2>
<p>The above methods describe how we propose to be able to extract an approximation of less or more salient aspects of meaning. In the first case, the vector is the representation of the less salient aspects of the concept of a word-type in a text/corpus, in the latter case, the list of connected terms is the representation of the more salient aspects of the concept of a word-type in a text/corpus. In the case of the extracted list of collocates, research sometimes focusses on the qualitative investigation of this list of words itself (indeed, the ability to do so is one of the attractive features of the entire approach).<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> The vector approach generally does not allow for this and is often coupled together with a measure of the similarity between vectors. This allows the researcher, for example, to check the stability of terms over time, find synonyms, and discover dissimilarity between terms which are expected to hang together.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> We introduce a commonly applied similarity measure for vector-representations and argue that there are useful options for measuring the similarity of lists of collocates. These measures will be used in the case study to extract useful information about our corpus for both sorts of meaning-representations.</p>
<p>In the case of the vector representation, what we are looking for is actually a measure for <em>closeness</em> of coordinates in a multi-dimensional space. A number of different options is available, but one of the more often used measures iscosine similarity<a class="footnote-ref" href="#han2012"> [han2012] </a>. Intuitively, how similar two vectors are is measured by looking at how much they coincide for each of their coordinates. A simple measure for this is provided in linear algebra by the inner product, or, dot-product. This measure sums the products of each pair of coordinates that lie in the same dimension, or:</p>
<p>v⃗∙w⃗=∑i=1Nv1<em>w1+v2</em>w2+..+vN*wN</p>
<p>Partly, this measure does what we want; the more (high) values shared between two vectors in similar dimensions, the higher the similarity of the two vectors will be. However, what is counter-intuitive is that longer vectors (vectors with higher values in many dimensions) will <em>generally</em> be scored higher than shorter vectors will be. However, it is not the case that just because a word-type has more strong connections with other word-types (higher PMI-scores) it should be deemed to be expected to be more similar to other word-types in general. This problem can be amended simply by normalizing the lengths of the two vectors; in this way, we only measure the similarity in distribution of values across the different dimensions of the two vectors, while negating the influence of their absolute lengths. We get for our similarity measure:</p>
<p>v⃗∙w⃗v⃗*|w⃗|</p>
<p>Linear algebra shows that this formula captures the same thing as taking the cosine of the angle between the two vectors <em>v</em> and <em>w</em> , hence the measure’s namecosine similarity. Higher values are attained when the distribution of values between two vectors amongst all the possible dimensions is similar – or, when the angle between the two vectors is close to zero (in addition, for orthogonal vectors, we get a similarity of 0, and for opposite vectors, a value of -1). This allows our measure to provide values between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>In the case of the lists of terms, how to model similarity is less researched because lists of terms do not easily translate into a question about vectors in space. Intuitively, however, what we want to measure is the amount of overlap two terms exhibit in their lists of collocates. The greater the overlap, the larger the amount of saliently connected terms two words share. What is dangerous however is that we do not want that word-types that have a larger number of strongly connected terms be more similar in general to other words (which would happen if we would take ‘a large overlap’ to be signified by a large number of overlapping terms). This needs to be normalized. One of the measures used for these purposes is the Jaccard index, which scores the overlap between the neighborhood of two nodes in a network in the following way:</p>
<p>|A∩B||A∪B|</p>
<p>The intersection provides the overlap and the union provides the sense of the ‘total’ size of the neighborhoods; sharing a large amount of terms provides a higher score the smaller the total sample size of potentially shared terms becomes.</p>
<p>This measure is straightforward in the special case that the neighborhoods have the same cardinality. The sets {E, F, G, H} and {G, H, I, J} will have a Jaccard index of 1/3; the intersection contains two elements (G and H), whereas the union contains six elements (E, F, G, H, I, J). In the case of the same cardinality, we also have the nice property that complete overlap will provide a score of 1. This breaks down in the case of dissimilar cardinalities. Take the Jaccard Index over {E, F} and {E, F, G, H}. This will turn out to be a half (two shared elements and four total elements). This means that the scores will be influenced by the lengths of the lists of collocates. However, this on its own is not a bad thing, as the length of the list tells us something about how much salient connections there are for the word within the corpus. If two terms significantly differ in this respect, it is reasonable to take this along in the calculations. What we do want to avoid (and what the Jaccard Index avoids) is that words with larger or smaller lists of terms get scored more or less highly on their similarity scores in general. This is not the case, since the length of the list only comes into play relatively to the length of the list of another word-type with which the similarity is measured. Word-types with the same, or a similar, neighborhood size will have a higher potential score, but this does not translate into a preference for either larger or smaller neighborhoods to influence the scoring on its own. In addition, the Jaccard index is commutative. It will always tell us that a first word is as similar to a second word as the second to the first. This maintains the intuitive symmetry of the similarity relation.</p>
<h2 id="intermezzo-a-comparison-with-word-embeddings">Intermezzo: a comparison with word embeddings</h2>
<p>As a brief intermezzo we will discuss why our mode of interpretation, which focuses on the salience of individual scores in the PMI-based semantic vector, would be much harder for word embedding based methods like word2vec<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mikolov2013"> [mikolov2013] </a>and BERT<a class="footnote-ref" href="#devlin2018"> [devlin2018] </a>. Such methods have been used in many semantic and linguistic contexts, including recently the tracing of semantic change in historical corpora<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hamilton2016"> [hamilton2016] </a>,<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wevers2020"> [wevers2020] </a>. In fact, for many tasks like tracking synonymy and homonymy word-embeddings are superior to the sparse vector approaches that have been interpreted above.</p>
<p>Word embeddings can make use of different architectures, but let us look at the continuous bag-of-words model. Making use of a neural net, an algorithm attempts to invent word vectors that are maximally useful in the task of predicting, on the basis of a collection of words surrounding a word’s position (the bag-of-words), what word will occur in the middle of these words. By altering the values (weights) of a word’s entries into its vector so as to be maximally effective at this task, a vector representation of the word is learned. As the algorithm learns, it doesn’t find the eventual weights, or scores, of words along a number of axes, it defines its own, maximally informative, axes. That is to say, in using a method like word2vec, not only are the scores that should define a word-vector extracted, but also the best conceptual frame of representing the word-vectors is constructed. However, due to the difficulty in interpreting what a particular axis stands for, it also becomes difficult to interpret individual scores along this axis as is done above (entries being interpreted for example, as more or less salient connection between word-types).</p>
<p>Consider the vector describing word type ‘The’ in table 1. This vector has 12 values, each representing the number of times the word ‘the’ co-occurred with the 12 other word types. Each of the vectors can be retraced to interpretable quantities through its elements which are interpretable quantities. By contrast a comparable word2vec vector would contain entries that represent variables invented by the algorithm. This does not allow for the word-type-pair-based analysis we propose.</p>
<p>To put it a bit more technically, word embeddings use various techniques to represent semantic properties in lowdimensional spaces. This reduction in the amount of dimensions has computational advantages, but the downside from an interpretative point of view is that it is less clear what the elements of vectors represent (in any case, there is no reasons to expect them to represent word-type-pair relations). Our methods also allow us to define a vector-space and norms on it (see the section on similarity measures) which has far more dimensions, but the directions, vectors, and individual entries can be much more readily interpreted because this space was invented by and for people.</p>
<p>It might be possible, instead of trying to interpret the individual steps of the algorithm produced by a teaching algorithm, to instead interpret what word embedding methods are good at, or what using certain training data teaches them<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> , but that is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>
<h2 id="stability-introducing-salience-differentiated-stability-scores">Stability: Introducing salience differentiated stability scores</h2>
<p>Having discussed two ways to model words, vector-representations and collocate-representation, which respectively model the less and the more salient aspects of its meaning, we now move to the concept of the stability of a word-type within a corpus of individual texts, which is the final ingredient required for our proposed application of combining differently measuring the more and less salient aspects of meaning.</p>
<p>For each of the works in a given corpus we can generate both vector and collocation representations of a set of different word-types that are relevant to the corpus. Using the similarity measures we have discussed above, we are able to compare each of these models to one another. In particular, we compare the models of the same word in different works. For instance, the usage of the term ‘cause’ in one work of the corpus can then be compared on the level of similarity (for both facets) with the usage of ‘cause’ in another work. For our two methods we then get a relation of similarity for each word-type between every work in the corpus. These results can be used for building up a network representation of the corpus. Consider for example Figure 1 below, which provides the resulting graph, based on the network of all similarity scores between all works in the corpus of early-modern English physics/natural philosophy textbooks that will be further detailed in section 5, for the vector-representation based method, indexed on the word ‘body’:</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The nodes stand for the different works in the corpus, while the weighted edges that connect them stand for the similarity between the two works in the generated models of the investigated word-type. Of course, one can analyze such a (set of) networks (one for each word-type) in many different ways to allow for interesting corpus analysis.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> We will only make use of a particular route of investigation – we will look at the average weight of the edges for each of these different networks (i.e. word-types) for both of the models available. On its own, this average of the edge weight intuitively gives a number that indicates how similar the word is used across the corpus. A high score indicates that many of the works have particularly similar models for their particular meaning of the investigated word-type. A low score by contrast tells us that the word is not used particularly similar across the corpus, and that the meaning of the term is particularly unstable. We’ll label these scores ‘stability scores’. Higher values signal that a term under investigation is used more similarly across the entire corpus, i.e., the term’s usage is more stable in that corpus than one that scores lower.</p>
<p>Our important claim regarding these numbers comes from the divergence between stability scores obtained by the same word-type, depending on whether we are considering their more or less salient aspects of meaning. Indeed, whereas one might expect to find two kinds of terms – terms that have high stability scores for both the more and less salient aspects of their meaning, and that score low on both – we find divergence between these scores. It is these divergencies of stability scores when one differentiates between more and less salient aspects of meaning that must be interpreted and that will be provided as our case-study. To investigate such scores we callsalience differentiated stability analysis.</p>
<h2 id="section-4-a-framework-for-interpreting-sds-scores">Section 4: A framework for interpreting SDS-scores</h2>
<p>We have used two methods to distinguish similarity between word usage. One of them, we argued, measured the most salient associations with a word, whereas the other measured it’s overall usage, including the most subtle differences in emphasis. We then used the Jaccard index and cosine similarity to gain an overall measure of how much a word is used similarly across texts, according to our two methods. It turns out that the two scores are not always correlated. Some words score highly on their average jaccard score but low on their average cosine similarity and vice versa. If this were to happen often, and in ways we could predict this would in itself be evidence that they measure different things.</p>
<p>For doing salience differentiated stability analysis, we can divide words into four categories, or even better, a two-dimensional grid where each word is closer to one corner or another. A word will either have a lot of salient difference in usage or not across a corpus, and it will have a lot of less salient differences in usage or not. Something interesting is to be said of each of these four categories.</p>
<p>The simplest are words which score high on both scores. These are words which are similarly understood by most authors and which are used in much the same way. We should expect them to have a straightforward and broadly understood meaning. Given that the terms are central to the corpus (to be ascertained via domain knowledge, or other methods, like topic modelling) one can expect the terms to be discussed, but not conceptually controversial.Words which score lowly on both scores are also quite straightforward. These are words which are understood differently and used differently. We should expect them to be at the center of controversies which are difficult to resolve, or to be outright polysemic.More interesting are words which are similar in salient ways but dissimilar in more subtle ways. Here superficial similarity may mask slippery differences in usage. We will call such words façades. If we follow Haslanger we should expect these words to be used in masking certain hypocrisies and if we follow Wilson these words may suggest a straightforward usage when they are in fact used in a façade-like manner, being used subtly differently in different areas of application. Alternatively it could indicate a controversy in a narrow domain, where the broad subject of discussion is fixed but the details are the subject of controversy.Lastly we have words which have a lot of salient dissimilarity but which are overall used relatively similarly. We should expect these words to be the subject of controversy whilst their actual use is relatively fixed.</p>
<h2 id="section-5-explorative-case-study-of-early-modern-natural-philosophical-terminology">Section 5: Explorative case-study of early modern natural philosophical terminology</h2>
<p>Now we turn to the case study. We reiterate: the purpose of this case study is not primarily to study the history of natural philosophy/physics. It is rather to provide a proof of concept of salience differentiated stability. If the case study were to bear out that all words are similarly stable, or that Jaccard scores do not yield different results from cosine similarities, our methods would be trivial. If some of the results were not plausibly interpretable, the results would simply be too garbled to show anything meaningful. Neither appears to be the case in this case study which provides at least a minimal proof of concept for salience differentiated stability.</p>
<p>Our corpus consists of early-modern British natural philosophical/physics textbooks (1600~1800), published in English. The corpus has been built within the context of the “The Normalisation of natural philosophy” project, based at the university of Groningen. It consists of abroad selection of natural philosophical/physics texts, annotated for their level of systematicity, from four geographical areas (Great-Britain, The Netherlands, Germany and France), between 1600 and 1800.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> From this corpus we’ve made use of the most systematic works in the British English language corpus that were also available in a digitized format. This led to a sub-corpus of 50 works, each of which has been OCR’ed in the context of the “Normalisation” project. The OCR’ing has been conducted with an expected accuracy of 90-95%<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sangiacomo"> [sangiacomo] </a>, sufficient for many text-mining methods, including for example vector-semantic modelling<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hill2019"> [hill2019] </a>and collocate-extraction<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sangiacomo"> [sangiacomo] </a>.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The texts are preprocessed by the lemmatization of the texts using the Natural Language Toolkit’s lemmatizer in Python<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bird2009"> [bird2009] </a>, removing low frequency words (&lt;4), removing numbers, interpunction and singular letters, decapitalization of all words, and the removal of OCR-based nonsense word types and articles. These steps are particular to this case-study, but the SDS-scores do not depend on any of these steps and can be applied to raw-texts as well as more heavily cleaned texts.</p>
<p>On the basis of this corpus we modeled 15 key terms’ SDS-scores. These key terms were derived both via domain knowledge and via topic modelling – a computational method that aims to extract the topics most central to the text.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> That is to say, they play a central role within the corpus, but the list of these 15 words is in no sense exhaustive of such terms.</p>
<p>In Figure 2 we have provided the results of our explorative case-study as to the differences in stability one can find in salient and non-salient connections for technical terminology in early-modern English language natural philosophy/physics. For each term and for each work in the corpus, we have generated models based on the distributional algorithms mentioned above (one to be interpreted as a model of the salient elements of the terms’ meaning, and the other as the less salient parts of the terms’ meaning). Based on the outcomes, the terms will be classified in our system introduced in section 4.</p>

</figure>
<p>Above we see a plot of the scores of our terminology. On the horizontal axis we have the average similarity normalized to the average corpus-wide similarity scores based on the collocation based approach, on the vertical, the same for the vector-based approach. From this, we are given four quadrants in which our values are plotted, which agree with the four categories we introduced in the previous section. The lower left quadrant signifies terms about which there is neither salient nor subtle stability in the terminology, the terms provoke discussion and their legitimacy is opposed. The upper right quadrant signifies terms that exhibit stability both in salient and subtle facets of their meaning – i.e. unproblematic, generally simple, terms. The lower right quadrant signifies terms that exhibit façade like behavior – the terms are stable and unproblematic at the surface level, but at the operative level exhibit unrecognized semantic shifts. Finally, the top left quadrant signifies what we have dubbed integral controversy terms – despite being central to much discussion, the terms exert a unifying power on the discourse through their subtle similarity. What follows is an interpretation of these results that places them within the literature on the development of early-modern natural philosophy – the case study is explorative and has as its main aim to show the possibility for fruitful application of the method.</p>
<h2 id="simple-terms">Simple terms:</h2>
<p>In the upper right quadrant we find 4 terms (excluding motion) – ‘earth’, ‘water’, ‘sun’ and ‘object’. The commonality between the first three terms is that they all refer to identifiable, concrete, phenomenally accessible, things. This is of course not to say there were no interesting discussions about these terms (a lot of astronomical work was done on the relation between the earth and the sun, and on the nature of these two planets) but the terms are still relatively straightforward qua meaning. For the sun in particular a simple ostensive definition is available, somewhat similarly for water (water being this ostensively available stuff, and other similar stuff). Indeed, the three terms are all very neatly counted as easily identifiable, concrete, objects of investigation within the discipline of natural philosophy (fire and electricity also inch close to this quadrant). ‘Object’ is the only abstract term of the four and also scores somewhat closer to the façade quadrant than the rest. But, the usage of a term like ‘object’ is simple – and there can be little truly different applications of it. Because even when speaking of mental, biological or physical objects, in all cases nothing changes about the ways in which they are objects.</p>
<h2 id="integral-controversy-terms">Integral controversy terms</h2>
<p>There are three terms in our case-study that fall (or almost fall) in the upper left quadrant that we have proposed to understand as being comprised of terms that are extremely central to the discourse, are central to much controversy, but enforce a certain unity into the discourse via implicit agreement on the more general connections that such terms have. ‘Motion’ and ‘matter’ are edge cases, so let’s first look at the clearest case, ‘body’.</p>
<p>‘Body’ is extremely central to early modern natural philosophy. The early mechanicist philosophies in the 16th century (like Descartes’ philosophy) let themselves be summarized in the striking sentence “bodies in motion,” or, “matter in motion” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#nadler1993"> [nadler1993] </a>,<a class="footnote-ref" href="#roux2017"> [roux2017] </a>. Although many schools (already existing in the form of scholastic schools, or following schools, like experimentalists and Newtonians) will reject mechanicism’s claim that the investigation of “bodies in motion” exhausts the activities of the natural philosopher, they however will all have to concede that the mechanicist has set the program: to be a natural philosopher is to (at least) have answers to questions pertaining to bodies (whatever they might exactly be) and their movements (whatever that might end up meaning exactly).</p>
<p>Once the program has been set – the natural philosopher is to say something about bodies – it is natural that ‘body’ itself becomes a contested term. The philosopher who can provide and defend a conception of ‘body’ such that it easily fits with his/her more general outlook is a philosopher who has successfully scaled the walls of natural philosophy. At the same time, these moves need to be made out in the open – since the eye of the reader is fixed on these terms. Façade-like behavior is not to be expected – all of the disagreement is out in the open, not hidden, nor is there any manifest agreement that could help hide subterranean disagreement.</p>
<p>A few examples will show the extent of the mutability of ‘body’ within early modern philosophy, where these mutations are central to the arguments provided. Descartes’ mechanicism comes together with a very explicit statement about the nature of what bodies are – they are primarily to be characterized by their extension. This is coupled together with a statement about the other ‘type of thing’ there is in the world, namely, thought. Bodies being extension means that all the other properties of bodies can be explained reductively by reference to their extensional properties (and their motions) – except any properties (or movements) that are to be explained via thought. If body is anything, it is to be extension, and if body is to not be anything in particular, it is not to be thought. Amazingly, in opposition to this, we find later natural philosophers to remain true to Descartes style of reasoning about body (1. Body is central to their activity as natural philosophers and 2. It is an investigation into body’s essential attributes and motions that should occupy them in particular) while in the meantime moving away wholly from his conception of body. Indeed, to make room for their particular systems of natural philosophy, we find thinkers like Moore, Cavendish and Conway, more or less destroy all properties ascribed to bodies by Descartes. For Conway, both the impenetrability (one of the ways the space filling ‘extension’ was often fleshed out) of bodies is opposed and it is claimed that bodies are both spiritual and material-like<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lopston1982"> [lopston1982] </a>. Cavendish phrases the issue somewhat differently, but for her too, bodies are coupled together with mental properties<a class="footnote-ref" href="#shaheen2019"> [shaheen2019] </a>, as is the case for Moore, who arguably provides less reworking since he mostly takes the extended conception of motion to be gappy in accounting for phenomena<a class="footnote-ref" href="#roux2017"> [roux2017] </a>. What allows for these very deep metaphysical discussions is that, in the end, bodies can be somewhat easily identified in everyday activity. And whatever the exact nature of bodies turns out to be, it should in the end still be mapped on a set of paradigmatic instances of bodies (even the radical turnaround one finds in a thinker like Conway, where one would expect the concept to be so definitively deformed to no longer map unto the same objects as previous concepts of body, is still applied to recognizable cases, like the different unmixed fluids and how they hang together in a single bottle).<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>So, what about ‘motion’ and ‘matter’? Generally, ‘matter’ was used more restrictively than ‘body’ – and was less easily identified with everyday objects in the way that bodies could be. One would expect that matter was less stable in application because matter was not so strictly tied together to phenomenally accessible paradigmatic examples (bodies might be best imagined as spheres, houses, coherent swathes of fluid, cannon balls whilst matter was often understood to encompass more restrictively the corpuscles that make up bodies). This is due to the Aristotelian roots of the concept – matter plays a role in the hylomorphic theories where things are essentially made up out of the combination of matter and form<a class="footnote-ref" href="#manning2012"> [manning2012] </a>.</p>
<p>Motion get reinterpreted radically within early-modern philosophy, motion as change makes place for motion as mere local-motion. However, this move is not as extensively challenged in the development of early modern natural philosophy as was body. While body functioned as the pivotal point where different conceptualizations could be made to do all of the metaphysical lifting, motion did not take up such a place. Motion was on the agenda but was more easily understood and less prone to the radical reinterpretations (after the initial reconfiguration) than occurred for body.</p>
<h2 id="façade-terms">Façade terms:</h2>
<p>In the lower right quadrant we would expect to find terms that exhibit façade like behavior. These are words similar in salient ways but dissimilar in more subtle ways. Superficial similarity may mask slippery differences in usage. Three terms seem to apply – ‘fire’, ‘electricity’, and ‘method’. We will not discuss ‘fire’, because, as we can see in the plot the distance between ‘fire’ and the ‘x=x’ line is very small. That is to say, the difference between the more and less salient scores is very small (98/104).</p>
<p>Similarly, ‘electricity’ will not be extensively considered for two reasons. Firstly, it’s quite close on the line toward the upper right quadrant. In addition, the technical nature of the term precludes a useful analysis without more extensive background knowledge of the term. A few short remarks that should be read in that light are that: ‘electricity’ has properties in common with ‘earth’, ‘sun’ and ‘water’ in the sense that it is a term that designates a somewhat properly delineated group of phenomena. In particular, static electrical effects (which resulted in the attraction of other objects) and magnetic materials (which show somewhat similar behavior) were termed electrical. Although practitioners disagreed on how to explain these phenomena, for some time, this set of phenomena was clearly delineated. However, further study revealed that some previously ‘electrical’ phenomena should be delineated from ‘the electrical per se’, in particular excluding magnetic phenomena from the term&rsquo;s extension<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gregory2007"> [gregory2007] </a>. In addition, there is the novelty of the topic in natural philosophy as a systematic topic of interest – whereas it was of fringe importance in foregoing natural philosophy, it gets conceptualized more systematically within early modern natural philosophy – the novelty should induce us to expect less stability in the application of the term in its non-salient features, whereas identifiable phenomena should make us expect more stable non-salient applications. What is less easily explained is the cause for the agreement about salient facets of electricity’s meaning – especially since the debate about electricity is often characterized as a number of schools disagreeing fundamentally about the nature of electricity (Ibid, p.35-42). Note that most of the systematic early modern explanation started to come up in the second half of the 18th century, making it only a small part of the timeline of our corpus. We leave this discussion as is.</p>
<p>Central in the lower right quadrant is ‘method’. Many early modern thinkers agreed on the centrality of method in science and presumably its salient stability can be explained by this as well as by a shared understanding of the overall concept. We might be able to explain its subtle instability by the fact that method as a word generally signifies that some technicalities are to come, but which technicalities differs depending on which method in particular will be discussed.</p>
<p>If we are correct, method’s presence in this quadrant can be explained without calling it a façade. Electricity might be a façade, but to uncover this would require more in depth analysis of the development of the concept of electricity in this period. This means that our case-study did not bear out our expectations – no clear cases of facades were found in the lower right quadrant.</p>
<h2 id="crisis-terms">Crisis terms:</h2>
<p>The most densely populated quadrant is that of the crisis terms (5 terms, excluding ‘matter’) – ‘part’, ‘cause’, ‘specie’, ‘form’, ‘experiment’. These are words which are understood differently and used differently. These terms are thus such that we should expect both that the terms were controversial and discussed explicitly in natural philosophy and that there were little methods available to tie these terms together via, for example, implicit agreement on the (paradigmatic) extension of these terms (as in the case of body).</p>
<p>All of these terms agree with this characterization. The four terms ‘part’, ‘cause’, ‘specie’ and ‘form’ are all derived from scholastic philosophy and heavily debated in early modern natural philosophy. Species, (substantial) forms and causes were all important aspects of the scholastic/Aristotelian framework, and were all reworked, or even outright rejected, in subsequent schools of natural philosophy (like Cartesianism and Newtonianism)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#blair2006"> [blair2006] </a>. Cause is already reworked by Descartes, who also rejects (although not fully) substantial forms<a class="footnote-ref" href="#flage1997"> [flage1997] </a>. We see species being rejected by mechanicists as well, as well as non-mechanicists like Conway<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conway1996"> [conway1996] </a>. Cause is outright rejected as being the proper object of investigation for natural philosophy by later Newtonians like van Musschenbroek<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sangiacomo2018"> [sangiacomo2018] </a>. Forms are sometimes reintroduced and reworked and all the while remain in play in the strong scholastic school that remains in operation for most of the early-modern period, particularly in the university context<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sangiacomo"> [sangiacomo] </a>. What differentiates these terms from body are two things: i) body has easily accessible paradigmatic instances of the concept’s extension which are not so readily available for, for example, part and form (and arguably, at least some of the fourfold of Aristotelian causes) and ii) whereas body was extensively discussed in the light of its given central position to the discipline, these terms were discussed because their position within the discipline were under dispute. Experiment has a similar structure, except there the discussion will not have been most explicitly between scholastic and new philosophies, but between rationalist/Hobbesian conceptions of natural philosophy and experimental/Boylean<a class="footnote-ref" href="#shapin2018"> [shapin2018] </a>. Again, not only is experiment a more technical term that allows for less easy identification of its extension (what even counts as an experiment, as opposed to observation, or an uninformative ‘account’)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#shapin2018"> [shapin2018] </a>. In these debates, it is also still up for grabs whether it has any place in natural philosophy. In this sense we propose the terms in quadrant to be crisis terms – they are central to the discipline, because in many ways, the form of the discipline is transformed by drastically questioning the contents and validity of these terms.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this paper two methods for the automated semantic investigations of corpora often used in the digital humanities have been compared over which facets of meaning they track. We’ve claimed that full vector-representations of a word’s meaning tracks the word’s more hidden, subtle and less salient aspects of its meaning and that the collocate-representation tracks the more salient aspects of its meaning. We’ve proposed a new measure on the basis of this which makes use of these features: Salience Differentiated Stability. SDS-scores signify the divergence between the salient stability and the non-salient of a word in a corpus of works. Finally, a small case study making use of SDS-scores concerning a corpus of early-modern natural philosophy has been provided.</p>

<p>For example, the problem with a very small windowsize is that it starts picking up on syntactic relations moreso than semantic relations (verbs will generally be scored lower with one another due to the syntactic restrictions on following up verbs with verbs for example) – meaning windowsize is not just an optimizable parameter, but one that can be tweaked to pick up on different features that may prove to be of interest. We have followed a windowsize that (very roughly) is small enough to approximate a ‘sentence length’ window, while being large enough to smooth out some of the syntactical connections – but the choice for 10 and not, say, 15, is somewhat arbitrarily made here. Other variations are also available, see for example<a class="footnote-ref" href="#debolla2019"> [debolla2019] </a>&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This is analogous to methods of finding out how two subsets of a probability space are correlated. There the normal procedure is to divide the chance of being in both by the chance of being in both under the hypothesis that they are independent: <em>P(x, y)/P(x)P(y)</em> . If the result is 1, they are independent, if higher, the two sets are positively correlated with higher numbers indicating stronger correlations, and if lower, they are anticorrelated, with lower numbers indicating stronger anticorrelation. Here we use the same idea albeit slightly complicated by the fact that we are working with windows around tokens of <em>x</em> , and that instances of y may be counted doubly. In most formulations of PMI<a class="footnote-ref" href="#church1989"> [church1989] </a>, the notation mimics more closely finding correlations between subsets of a probability space – computationally, we do the same thing as these authors.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The choice for the minimal threshold for the PMI value might appear arbitrary, while also being significantly influential in the differences between the output of the two methods we propose to give an interpretation.

<p>The execution of Maximillian, Emperor of Mexico, by the army of Benito Juarez in 1867 had international ramifications, and the world became polarized. The press around the globe reported it and rallied the population in favor or against the event. In this analysis, we explore the underlying sentiments and emotions embedded in the texts that circulated inthe press, as a case study of the project Oceanic Exchanges, whose aim was to uncover how the international was refracted through the local as news, applying text mining methods to a corpus of national digitized nineteenth-century newspapers.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is that regional emotional content variations of news reveal the political undertones and biases of information flows. The latter aspect is fostered by the fact that the execution of Maximilian was, from the outset, an incident that divided opinions.</p>
<p>To that goal, we put together a corpus that includes digitized newspapers from different regions in North America and Europe, encompassing material from the actual arena of the execution, Mexico, from the country of Maximilian&rsquo;s ancestry, Austria as well as from the US and Germany<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that covered the news abundantly<a class="footnote-ref" href="#priani2019"> [priani2019] </a>. After dividing the corpus into geographical regions, we use quantitative methods –word frequency distributions and named entity recognition (NER)–to first look at the corpus. Then, using qualitative content analysis, we narrowed the information to compare the different regions. Finally, using automated sentiment analysis tools, we were able to compare the automatic analysis to the human one, showing a similar and clear sentimental trend in both methods depending on the geographical region: the Austrian/German press had a negative bias, while the Mexican newspapers showed a more positive picture, and the US showed mixed sentiments.</p>
<p>The case of Maximilian is particularly illuminating from the perspective of global news flows since it happened soon after the inauguration of the transatlantic cable in a country that was fighting a civil war between liberals and conservatives. The execution news tells a story of control and manipulation over the flow of news and, at the same time, a story that could be wired and rapidly forwarded over the Atlantic.</p>
<h2 id="historical-background">Historical background</h2>
<p>In 1860, Mexico was broken. The War of Independence (1810) bankrupted the country and fuelled endless confrontations between liberals and conservatives, who came and went in the presidency during the century.</p>
<p>Benito Juarez&rsquo;s introduction of the Reform Laws between 1855 and 1859 separated the Church from the State, suppressed military and religious tribunals, declared the nationalization of church properties, and introduced free press and civil registration, deepening the struggle between these political groups. In 1861, Benito Juárez, a liberal, was reelected to the presidency. With minimal financial resources, he decided to suspend the payment of debts and interests to Britain, Spain, and France.</p>
<p>According to Josefina Zoraida Vázquez (<a href="#vazquez2007">2007</a>), monarchists and conservatives living in Europe took advantage of this decision and proposed to Napoleon III the establishment of a Mexican monarchy. The idea that an Emperor could put an end to the turmoil was extensive among Mexican liberals and conservatives, as Duncan (<a href="#duncan1996">1996</a>) has pointed out, and with that support, the emperor of France saw the opportunity to extend his influence over America and stop the growing power of the United States.</p>
<p>On October 31, 1861, summoned by France, the three countries signed a treaty to block Mexico&rsquo;s ports on the Gulf of Mexico to pressure payment of the debt. After negotiations, Britain and Spain accepted new terms, but France refused and decided to invade Mexico.</p>
<p>After a year of confrontations, the invaders took the capital. Juárez&rsquo;s government was exiled but continued a guerrilla-style confrontation all over the country. Two years later, on April 10, 1864, Maximilian of Habsburg –brother of the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I and married to Charlotte of Belgium, daughter of King Leopold–, accepted the Mexican throne and traveled to the country.</p>
<p>In the last months of 1865, circumstances changed. The end of the Civil War in the United States opened the doors to new credits to Juárez, which helped fortify his army. At the same time, the French army abandoned Mexico, and the Maximilian government went bankrupt and started losing battles and territory.</p>
<p>In May 1867, Maximilian was captured –along with commanders Miguel Miramón and Tomás Mejía– by the Republican Army Commanded by Mariano Escobedo in the City of Querétaro in central México. Juárez and his Foreign Affairs secretary, Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada, resisted international pressure to exile Maximilian back to Europe in the following month. After a short trial, on June 19, 1867, Maximilian was executed at the Cerro de las Campanas, Querétaro, along with the last remaining commanders of the conservative army (Vanderwood 2010, 367-8). This execution resulted in an abundant flow of news analyzed in this article.</p>
<h2 id="corpora-description">Corpora description</h2>
<p>Our corpus<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> was obtained by searchingMaximilianandDeathin digitized European, Mexican, and United States newspaper collections (on the nature of these collections, see<a class="footnote-ref" href="#beals2020"> [beals2020] </a>). The US papers originated from Chronicling America, maintained by the Library of Congress, the Mexican papers from Hemeroteca Nacional Digital de México. For the German-language press, we drew on the Europeana dataset, which includes newspapers from Germany (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Hamburg State Library and Teßmann Library) and Austria (Österreichische Nationalbibliothek). In order to work with the German-language corpus, we automatically extracted the newspapers&rsquo; publication city and further divided the corpus into two regional categories: German and Austrian, resulting in a final corpus of 1,382 news stories published between the 5th and 20th of July 1867. Although Maximilian&rsquo;s execution took place two weeks earlier, on June 19, 1867, the news did not break until later because of the control of the Juarez&rsquo;s army over the telegram around Queretaro and the flow of the news from there<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mendezmoreno1967"> [mendezmoreno1967] </a>.</p>
<p>Neither the size of the corpora nor the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) quality was the same for all subcorpora. Cultural, political, and economic differences in each region affected the number of newspapers circulating. Mexico was going through a political crisis, and there was much control over the press. On the contrary, the United States had a lot of local newspapers. These differences result in an imbalance in news coverage, and therefore in the regional corpora. The US news occupies as much as 53.1% of the news coverage in the whole dataset. The proportion of the Austrian subcorpus is 12.6%, the German one 32.5 % and the Mexican one only 1.8 %.</p>
<p>In addition to the imbalance of digitized contents, another common obstacle is the quality of the original OCR from each newspaper library (on the problem of OCR noise, see<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jarlbrink2017"> [jarlbrink2017] </a>). Each nation establishes its newspaper digitization methodology, determining the quality and how and what can be extracted from each source. The OCR processes have been different, including the scanning practices and OCR software and the quality of the original newspapers, the objects of scanning. In most cases, the scanning has been done from microfilm, not from paper, and the original typeset, characters, and font sizes cause variation in the quality of OCR.</p>
<p>As a part of the Oceanic Exchanges Project, we decided to work with the OCR from each library without cleaning it. According to Beals and Bell (<a href="#beals2020">2020</a>), the Oceanic Exchanges corpus OCR quality ranges between 60-85%, but it varies within each country&rsquo;s corpora. Nonetheless, as Ryan Cordell pointed out, “methods such as text mining rely not on the nineteenth-century newspapers themselves, but on those newspapers as a remediated by mass digitization, a phrase that shorthands elaborate systems of scholarship, preservation, bureaucracy, human labor, machine processes, and economics” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cordell2017"> [cordell2017] </a>.</p>
<p>However, following this path, we faced two challenges: one practical and one human. The practical challenge was that the US and Mexican subcorpora had poor OCR quality compared to the Austrian and German. The human challenge was that as an international team, participants from different countries have different scholarship cultures. The Mexican team, for example, was not familiar with working with dirty OCR and, because the corpus was not large, decided to transcribe all of their news items.</p>
<p>We decided to work with the Mexican corpus as it was prepared by the Mexican team, respecting its work and effort. In the case of the US subcorpus, the automatic extraction included everything on the page, and there were no breaks between news stories and columns –like in the German and Austrian corpus. The raw data included the news item about Maximilian&rsquo;s death and any other news stories on the page, making it hard to work with. Since there were thousands of hits, we narrowed the information down through an automated process, i.e, filtering chunks of surrounding text (windows of words to the right and to the left) wereMaximilianis mentioned. This eliminated most of the unwanted information, although it was a superficial strategy prone to some noise. As we assume newspapers are remediated by mass digitization, we also assume that our corpus expresses how digital humanities are produced in global teams that must manage cultural and technological differences. Finally, Table 1 shows the size of the text corpora (in terms of number of words) that we used for our analysis.<br>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>We employed several methodologies to study the sentiments and emotions in news stories that circulated in the press after the execution of Maximilian I, the Mexican emperor. First, we used existing digital tools that draw on NLP, a multidisciplinary field aiming to automatically process large amounts of natural language data, and we performed qualitative analysis of the automatically extracted named entities (discussed below). After this process, we analyzed the emotional contents of the corpora by drawing on such automatic NLP tools. In recent years, sentiment analysis has been applied to extensive collections of news, online product reviews, and other types of corpora. However, little attention has been paid to historical news documents<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sprugnoli2016"> [sprugnoli2016] </a>. Few works have applied sentiment analysis to drama plays, literary texts, and other types of historical sources<a class="footnote-ref" href="#schmidt2018a"> [schmidt2018a] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#schmidt2018b"> [schmidt2018b] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim2018"> [kim2018] </a>.</p>
<p>In our case, we used automatic tools based on machine learning techniques to detect named entities and estimate a text&rsquo;s polarity. Thus, these systems are not based on explicit rules for each language; instead, they rely on statistical methods trained in large amounts of data. Particularly, we used Google Cloud<a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language">Natural Language API</a>, Python programming and the<a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK toolkit</a>to pre-process the documents and extract information.</p>
<p>Our initial point of departure was to extract general statistics to explore the word frequency distributions in each subcorpus. This provided a general overview of the relevant terms in each region. It is essential to mention that the corpora were pre-processed, i.e., we tokenized it and filtered the stopwords that do not carry semantic content (prepositions, determiners, conjunctions, function words). We then used Named Entity Recognition (NER), Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology that automatically identifies words (or sequence of words) that belong to specific categories, i.e., abstract or physical entities denote proper names. Previously, these tools have been used to analyze nineteenth-century newspapers, but never in tandem to study news stories&rsquo; underlying sentiments and emotions. For example, some international projects are using NLP to study big data corpora, as well as developing analytical and visualization tools, like the Media Monitoring of the Past (2020) and the NewsEye (2020) projects, as well as Gale&rsquo;s Digital Scholar Lab (2020), which offers several NLP tools for researchers.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of knowledge about the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to analyze newspaper collections<a class="footnote-ref" href="#neudecker2014"> [neudecker2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#mac2015"> [mac2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#kettunen2017"> [kettunen2017] </a>. Likewise, there is an interest in identifying and making more robust computerized tools for historical newspapers analysis<a class="footnote-ref" href="#yang2011"> [yang2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ehrmann2020"> [ehrmann2020] </a>.</p>
<p>There are several approaches for performing NER tasks. In our case, we automatically identified the following entities in the documents: person, location, organization, event, consumer good, and others (using Google Cloud Natural Language API). We extracted named entities from the subcorpora of Austria, Mexico, Germany, USA. Once we automatically identified named entities for each subcorpus, we performed a manual selection of entities. This selection was based on three criteria: 1) frequency of the entity, 2) the entity appears in at least two regions, 3) it has historical significance –understood as it references an important event, person, location, or organization in the shooting of Maximilian.</p>
<p>We identified the reduced set as &ldquo;entities of interest.&rdquo; It was helpful to make a contrastive analysis across subcorpora, i.e., the different approaches to specific events, persons, locations, or organizations., depending on the country.</p>
<p>To facilitate the analysis of these entities of interest, we extracted contexts for each entity in the text. We defined context as a window of 20 words to the left and the right of each entity (fixed size), as seen in Table 2. Moreover, we extracted a list of words that appear in similar contexts to each entity of interest using NLP techniques and the NLTK toolkit. Then, Google Translate API was used to automatically translate the extracted contexts into English. Since we were a multilingual team and we worked with a corpus in several languages, we chose English as the lingua franca to communicate and work. Early on, we decided to translate all the news stories into English, adding certain complications to the analysis, which were controlled but never entirely eliminated.<br>

El 1and military and met the deadline, the prisoners were taken to the gallows; to get to the place of execution, it was held by order of Supremo_Gobierno, which extended the deadline for another three days.

Finally, we ran an Automatic Sentiment Analyzer on the news of each corpus. Automatic sentiment analysis is the task of identifying and quantifying the polarity of an opinion expressed in a written text, e.g., positive or negative. This is done employing NLP and text mining techniques<a class="footnote-ref" href="#liu2012"> [liu2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#feldman2013"> [feldman2013] </a>.</p>
<p>The automatic sentiment analysis provided a negative, positive or neutral sentimental score for the newspaper publications. This allowed us to determine if there were underlying differences between regions.Since we are using models already trained by Google Cloud Natural Language API, no external dictionaries of setiment/polarity words are needed to perform this task.</p>
<p>We performed a qualitative content analysis<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fernandez2002"> [fernandez2002] </a>to identify attitudes, beliefs, wishes, values, and interest to understand the sentiments and emotions underlying the corpus&rsquo; news stories and identify geographical differences. We extracted the textual contexts for the named entities for each region. Each entity was analyzed, and main sentiments and emotions were pinpointed by identifying words that carried emotional content, such asdisgust, horror, revulsionfor the entityexecution.This produced an organic identification of sentiment categories in the new stories selected by region, which allowed us to compare and contrast, thus understanding how Maximilian&rsquo;s death was perceived.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the used automatic tools are not explicitly adapted to specific domains such as historical news documents. However, these statistical methods can cope, to some extent, with language variation and diachrony. This means that they do not rely on fixed lexicons and rules. Instead, they focus on different features of the text to predict how likely it is that a token is a maned entity, e.g., the structure of the sentence, distributional semantics of the words, and training with millions of examples before. Due to this, our methodology does not entirely rely on the automatic tool&rsquo;s output, but it is complemented with a fine-grained qualitative analysis.</p>

<p>We started by obtaining word frequency distributions for each region. Function words were automatically eliminated to work only with content-filled items. Just for the sake of illustration, Figure 1 shows word clouds with the most frequent words in Austria’s and Mexico’s corpora.</p>
<p>Going into more detail, Figure 2 displays the relative frequency of the top 10 most frequent words per region. These plots show which concepts were the most used per region:maximilian,emperor,andmexicowere at the top of all of the regions, of course — followed by items such asgovernmentanddeath.Since this is what the news reports were about, they are expected.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the ones that are not repeated are also important to our study. For example, in Mexico&rsquo;s media,republic,president,andQueretaro–the city where Maximilian was apprehended and shot–, stand out, whileemperorimperial,majesty,andparisfrancehave more preponderance in the European press. In other words, this exposes a Eurocentric point of view: for the old continent, it was more important to refer to European cities and the idea of a Mexican Empire –since this was the power system held over there– while to Mexico’s press, Queretaro is an important city to the country, and the Republican president had just taken over.</p>
<p>Given we only show the top 10 words, some terms may appear in every regional media but without the same relevance. Some European newspapers did use words likerepublic,but they got ranked lower in frequency. Likewise, terms likeemperorandempireare not ranked in the top 10 for Mexico&rsquo;s corpus but appear in lower frequency ranks, as seen in Figure 2.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that the plots show relative frequencies to make them more easily comparable across corpora, i.e., each word count is divided by the total number of words in the current corpus. As mentioned, the data is unbalanced from the outset. The US material is abundant while other subcorpora are limited.</p>

<p>As we mentioned before, we used NER techniques for a more detailed analysis by identifying the significant entities in each subcorpus. Since NER techniques enlist all entities in the subcorpora, meaning thousands of results, we decided to only focus on the 100 most frequent entities. Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 in the following section show the named entities frequency distribution for each region.</p>
<p>Although we revised the 100 most frequent entities, we only show the 30 most frequent entities on the plots for the sake of illustration. For complete results, see the repository.</p>
<p>The range of absolute frequency values is larger in regions like Austria or Germany than in Mexico. This is due to the unbalanced nature of the corpora, i.e., the sociopolitical factors that impacted the amount of news produced in each country.</p>
<p>The automatic NER techniques faced some problems when dealing with this corpora. Sometimes, the algorithm detected non-content words that did not provide relevant information, although they belonged to a specific NER category, e.g.,sir,man,mister.</p>
<p>The algorithm was also affected by the OCR errors, since in some cases, it could mislabel broken words, e.g.,sp,gr,schorm,as named entities, registered in all regions to some extent. However, these mislabelings did not constitute a major problem since they were not within the most frequent named entities.</p>
<p>Moreover, orthographic variations also had an impact on the frequency distributions. For instance, we could find entities like Mexico or Maximilian written differently and with different frequencies associated.</p>
<p>In the end, we tried to be careful with all these considerations. We eliminated errors and normalized the variations to take them as a single entity.</p>
<p>Table 3 shows the selectedentities of interestlist for the content analysis from all the entities. In order to obtain this list, first, all the most frequent items per entity were contrasted between regions. Then, those that appeared in several regions or were of high historical significance were selected.</p>
<p>Although the entities were extracted in the original language, they were then translated into English. We extracted reduced lists of named entities for the Mexican, Austria, German subcorpora.<br>
Selected list named entitiesEntityEventPersonLocationOrganizationExecutionPresidentWorldArmyDeathEmperorCitySupreme GovernmentExpeditionPrinceRepublicMagnusCountryFrench People<br>
From these contexts, we found that there are many reprinted stories, especially in the regions of Austria and Germany. In other words, some articles reappeared in different newspapers, occurring both within and between regions. This points to the fact that there is a cultural resemblance among them, viewing Maximilian&rsquo;s shooting through a similar lens: a negative one in the European press. We found a similar situation in the United States newspaper. Table 4 shows an example of these repetitions. Meanwhile, in the Mexican press, this was not as common. This probably is the case because new information from far away was harder to get, and articles were reused.</p>
<p>This implies that the emotions, at least in part, are a result of external factors. The newspaper&rsquo;s position is determined not just by an editorial decision but also by the need to fill space, lack of a correspondent, or the popularity of a particular text. This is also important to consider when analyzing the score from the automatic sentiment analysis because reprints will bias the results.<br>

<h2 id="content-analysis">Content Analysis</h2>
<p>To continue the analysis from the reduced list of entities, we did a qualitative content analysis<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fernandez2002"> [fernandez2002] </a>to understand the sentimental underlying per subcorpora qualitatively. These items are essential content words in Maximilian&rsquo;s shooting and expose how each region considered the news story particularly. The study of the entities of interest showed two different points of view about Maximilian&rsquo;s shooting: the Mexican press tends towards neutrality with a bit of positivity, and the European and United States press inclines to a neutral-negative position. For examples of each entity of interest, see appendices 1A-1J.</p>
<p>For the category &ldquo;event,&rdquo; four words were the most predominant in the analysis. These either appeared in all or most of the regions or refer to key aspects of the situation. Figure 3 shows the distribution of these entities within each subcorpora.</p>

<p>The wordexecution,for example, in the Mexican press, is used in terms of official governmental statements about the execution. Most of the published documents in Mexican newspapers are the telegrams sent between Mariano Escobedo, head of the military army in Queretaro, and Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada, Minister of State to President Juarez, in San Luis Potosi, discussing the procedure, trial, and shooting of Maximilian. We found few opinion pieces (op-ed) in the corpus, which leads us to think that there was governmental control of the press, not an unprecedented situation in Mexico. The situation is kept under control by publishing short, non-emotional telegrams, probably avoiding a more prominent international situation. After the breakthrough of telegram connections, international news events were often quickly reported through this technology that favored short notices: longer texts, with more emotional undertones and editorial considerations, came with a delay<a class="footnote-ref" href="#oiva2019"> [oiva2019] </a>.</p>
<p>In the Austrian and German press, as well as in the United States newspapers, there is a clear negative sentiment towards the execution of Maximilian, and it is expressed through the use of adjectives such asdisgust,horror,revulsion,regrettable,tremendous sensation,without mercy,shameful,pain,sadness,vigorously protested. For example, Regensburger Anzeiger in Germany wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emperor Maximilian was handed his opponents in his sleep. The assassination of the Emperor Maximilian will excite general disgust. This infamous, arranged from Juarez (July 06, 1867).<br>
<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><br>
Similarly, outlets from the United States expressed a negative sentiment by describing the execution with words likedenouncing crime against humanity,indignation,horror,brutal,infamous,question international law,compared toLouis XVI. In the Mexican press, the worddeathmainly refers to the death sentence in the published official telegrams. Sometimes, though, it exposed fake news from the time because they reported about Charlotte&rsquo;s death in Europe and Miramón succumbing to his war injuries. Both did not happen at the time, but they seem to help the official narrative emotionally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The German and Austrian press useddeathin different ways. Some reports exalt Maximilian&rsquo;s positive characteristics:honorable,good,noble,brave,amiable,chivalrous,prince. Others concentrate on blaming and finding out who was ultimately responsible for his death: Napoleon for abandoning him in Mexico or the United States for not stopping Juarez. The third type of news story was about European royals and dignitaries mourning. The US press paints his death as unfavorable by condemning it. The use ofexpeditionandcatastrophe(disaster) also alludes to sentiments. Expedition refers to England, Spain, and France&rsquo;s 1862 invasion of Mexico, which led to Maximilian&rsquo;s proclamation as emperor. German and Austrian newspapers, on the one hand, present some criticism towards the expedition, particularly towards France and Napoleon III. On the other, they call for an immediate new expedition to avenge the destiny of the Austrian Prince. The newspapers from the United States also use the termexpeditionto refer to the attack the European countries charged against Mexico but do not publish anything about a new expedition.</p>
<p>In a similar matter,catastrophe– meaning an emotional disaster, not a natural one– is a window into the sentimental biases of the press. While theMexican Expeditionwas good, Maximilian&rsquo;s death is aMexican Disasterin the Austrian and German corpora. In other words, for some of the European press, an expedition that cost thousands of lives the death of one person is a disaster, but the killing of thousands of Mexicans during the war is an expedition. As seen in the previous analysis of entities, language indicates the newspapers&rsquo; point of view (see Appendix 1c and 1d).</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the Mexican press,expeditionandcatastrophewere found only once but were depicted differently: the expedition is unfortunate, and the results of the expedition were catastrophic. In other words, Maximilian&rsquo;s death is not perceived as a disaster. The English, Spanish and French invasion was a military intervention to the Mexican press, which became historically known as theFrench Intervention(see appendix 1e).</p>
<p>For the entity of person, the most notable names or political figures that constantly appear in the news are president, Maximilian, prince, Magnus, and French people. Once again, they are used differently depending on the regional context (see Figure 4).</p>

<p>In the Mexican and USA press,presidentrefers to President Benito Juarez, while for the Austrian and German press, it mainly refers to the head of the legislative branches of European governments, for example, President Schneider of France&rsquo;s Corps Legislative; with very few allusions to President Juarez (see appendix 1f).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ness which “will now come back to it was brought. (Stormy interruption.) President Schneider: The last words de «honorable gentleman JnleS Favre could be facing the whole country” (Das Vaterland, Wien, July 13, 1867).<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Juarez won the war against Maximilian, being referred to as President is expected, as happened in the USA press. But the European press never mentions Juarez as president, showing how newspapers use the title as a way to accept or refuse his authority. This does not mean that there are no occurrences, but they are rare.</p>
<p>We found the opposite situation with the itememperor.While it is true that it is used in all regions, there are essential differences that contrast with the use of president. Primarily,emperorrefers to Maximilian and Franz Joseph of Austria and Napoleon III of France. Nonetheless, in the Mexican press, it is used to refer mostily to Maximilian and is followed by negative descriptors, such asusurper: the use of appellatives reveals the emotional underlying of news stories (see appendix 1g).</p>
<p>A similar situation happens in the last three entities –prince,Magnus,andFrench people– (see appendix 1h).Prince,referring to Maximilian, usesunfortunate,noble,andbraveadjectives in the German and Austrian papers. In the Mexican publications, he is alluded to asprince of Europeor, in some cases, asprisoner prince.For the rest of the newspapers, the word is not associated with anything directly linked to Maximilian&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Magnus was a central person to Maximilian&rsquo;s shooting because he was his lawyer during the trial. Many Mexican papers mentioned him because he was constantly talked about in governmental correspondence. He is also mentioned in other international newspapers because we detected a reprint of a letter he sent. Nonetheless, he does not appear among the first 100 frequently used person entities.</p>
<p>French Peoplewas an interesting case because it is mainly used in the German-language newspapers to assign blame for abandoning Maximilian in Mexico to his death. It is also used similarly in the USA. In Mexico, this term does not appear. Both the mentioning or lack of it helped understand the underlying sentiment in news publications in this entity. For example,Juarez!does not appear among the most frequent terms in European newspapers. The algorithm probably causes this due to an OCR problem: parts of his name can be read often, but often cut. If the materials were cleaned, Juarez would probably become more prominent.</p>
<p>Worldandcitywere the two most relevant location entities. Many cities are mentioned because they refer to the publishing place and important landmarks or battles, but allusions to Paris and Vienna were most common. In Mexico, the press refers to Queretaro constantly. The US papers mainly mention Mexico City. There were few references to the Cerro de la campana, where Maximilian was shot (figure 5).</p>

<p>In the Mexican papers, the entityworldis used to express that the world will understand or that the world mourns the death, but in the European press, the world is interror,condemns,loathes,or claims it was a murder. Also, there was a distinction between the civilized world and the barbarians and between the old and new world. There are allusions to a shock to the civilized, Christian, and old-world in the USA.</p>
<p>Other entities asrepublicandcountryare persistent in some regions but not in others, although they appear in all the corpora (see appendix 1i). For example,republicis constantly alluded to in the Mexican press, especially the president, while this is rarely done in European material. The US press does acknowledge this form of government in Mexico. On the other hand, the country often does not appear in the Mexican newspapers, but it does in the Austrian next to words such asbarbariansormisfortune.This antagonism helps create a negative sentiment towards Maximilian&rsquo;s death. Nonetheless, since his shooting was perceived as a positive moment in Mexico, the negative adjectives and points of view are not frequent.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The last of the entities isorganization(figure 6). In this category, two items stood up:armyandSupreme governmentorgovernment (see appendix 1j). Each region gave more prevalence to different armies: in the Mexican press, most mentions are about theEjército del Norte,Marino Escobedo&rsquo;s North Division; for the German and Austrian press, most references are made to the French army abandoning Mexico and leaving Maximilian to his fate, while few mentions allude to Juarez&rsquo;s Liberal Army. Similarly, the Mexican press -and sometimes the US media-usesSupreme Governmentto write about Juarez&rsquo;s administration. . Meanwhile, in the European press, it primarily refers to the European governments.</p>

<p>Once more, the different use of words depending on the region shows a bias towards specific themes or sentiments. While in Mexico,Supreme Governmentappears many times since that is how they referred to Juarez&rsquo;s government. In Europe, these words allude to the governments of that continent and only sometimes to the Mexican one. The same thing happens witharmy.In both instances, it is clear that, for the Europeans, what matters tends to be local issues, while in Mexico, Juarez dealings tend to be exalted.</p>

<h2 id="automated-sentiment-analysis">Automated Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p>To complement the previous results, we explored emotions using a fully automated sentiment analysis that quantifies the sentiment trend in each newspaper story. We obtained a sentimental score for the newspaper publications, which allows us to know the general sentiment trend per region.</p>
<p>Table 5 shows the average sentiment score per region — the more negative the values, the more negative the polarity. Likewise, positive values indicate positive sentiment polarity (zero represents neutrality).<br>

The following bar charts (Figure 7) show a more detailed overview of the sentiment score by region. We have averaged the score of all news stories published by each newspaper in the different regions in these plots. Also, it can be observed how the number of sources varies in each region. The Austrians and Germans wrote many news stories showing a general tendency to one side of the sentiment continuum. For example, the Austrian bar chart has mostly negative stories, while the Mexican bar chart has mainly positive stories. We have excluded the USA from these visualizations since, for this particular case, we did not preserve the newspaper source information for each news story. This is due to the OCR cleaning and pre-processing steps involved in this specific database, where we had to filter just the text portions with relevant information about the Maximilian case. Still, the graph shows the sentiment distribution of the news stories, albeit without the name of the newspapers (see appendix 2).</p>

<p>Table 5 shows this general tendency clearly. Mexican newspapers are inclined towards a positive direction, while European newspapers and those from the United States are prone to consider Maximilian&rsquo;s shooting as negative.. Meanwhile, the Mexican press shows an alliance with the government in power, meaning Juarez&rsquo;s republic. They only printed official statements and communications from the events, meaning telegraphic messages between Mariano Escobedo in Queretaro&rsquo;s battlefront and Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada –Minister of Foreign Affairs under Juarez– in San Luis Potosi. Since they are mostly short and to the point messages, the sentiment analysis results closer to neutrality. The United States, while it might not agree with the imperial governmental system, opposes the actions taken by Juarez. Therefore, news stories tend to focus on the negative aspects of the shooting. The German newspapers are less extreme than the Austrian ones, maybe because Maximilian was an Austrian prince.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the averages are very low since both sides are very close to neutrality. It should be considered that newspapers, as an institutional ethos, tend to strive for certain neutrality. Although not always achieved –like songs, poems and op-ed can be found– it does tend towards the middle and away from extreme views.</p>
<p>In summary, the use of fully automated tools to measure sentiment in newspapers about Maximilian shooting provided similar results to the analysis previously done using other techniques –such as content analysis, obtaining the frequency of common words and named entities–, which shows that these digital techniques can identify the underlying ideological positions from each region. It is important to mention that the differences are small but significant enough to evidence the variations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This study has focused on the international news flows on the execution of Maximilian, the Emperor of Mexico. The execution took place in June 1867, and the news started to flow across borders at the beginning of July, reaching global readership through newspapers. The aim of this study has been twofold. First, the study concentrated on finding ways of analyzing sentiments in a multilingual research setting. Second, it was to investigate the regional differences in sentiments evoked by the execution in the press internationally.</p>
<p>This study has explored the use of several digitized newspaper corpora on a transnational scale. It has drawn on newspapers from four regions: Austria, Germany, Mexico, and the United States in three languages. We selected the timeframe from 5 July to 20 July, extracted the news on the execution from the available corpora, and explored this multilingual data set with several strategies.</p>
<p>Contentwise, our article has been the first study on the transnational reception of a significant news event of its time, the execution of the Emperor of Mexico. It has covered newspapers from two continents and four geographical regions. The case itself is illuminating from the perspective that it happened very near to the inauguration of the transatlantic telegraph cable and indicates how quickly news circulated. The execution was a politically loaded media event that aroused mixed feelings and ambiguous emotions. The execution was not only a domestic case to Mexico because the United States and some European countries were deeply involved in the affair. Our analysis shows content variations in the corpora, meaning that the news was framed differently in each studied region, indicating that the local perception of the event and polítical interests shaped the news. In our corpus, the Mexican press –published in the middle of a political crisis– tended towards a neutral stance, the Austrian and German papers mainly were negative, and the United States showed mixed sentiments on the incident.</p>
<p>Our study faced two limitations that have to be addressed in most newspaper projects in the digital humanities. On the one hand, the size of each subcorpora varied because of cultural, political, and economic reasons. On the other hand, digitized newspapers have been optically recognized with an OCR software based on particular scanning practices, which produced differences in quality. However, we argue that it is possible to transgress the OCR problem and the multilingual nature of the data, as we have done, and conduct transnational research. We drew on quantitative solutions such as named-entity recognition, frequency distributions, and textual context analysis in conjunction with qualitative analysis. This permitted us to study the underlying sentiments in the newspapers from the nineteenth century. We have a significant outcome contrasting the result of automatic sentiment analysis tools combined with quantitative and qualitative analysis that suggested the automatic sentiment analysis tools results are trustworthy for our nineteenth-century newspaper corpus.</p>

<p>It should be noted that in the 1860s, there was no Germany in the present understanding but independent states that formed the German Confederation. In 1867, the New German Confederation was born under the Prussian leadership, excluding Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden, and Hesse-Darmstadt (that joined the Confederation again in 1870). Austria, in turn, was a multilingual, multiethnic empire that reached many present-day areas, for example, Northern Italy, Slovenia, and Romania.

<p>The recent history of the humanities in American and European universities is one of neglect. Governments have shifted towards an instrumentalization of education policies, which has included the accelerated expansion and promotion of tertiary education in STEM subjects, partly due to competition with the growing economies of Asia. An influential 2011 report on STEM education and employment from the U.S. Department of Commerce argues that “science, technology, engineering and mathematics workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and are a critical component to helping the U.S. <em>win the future</em> ” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#langdonetal2011"> [langdonetal2011] </a>. There is a general perception that this strategic focus on STEM has been detrimental to fields beyond its scope, particularly to the humanities. Rarely does a semester go by without a prominent academic declaring that the humanities are in crisis, and some have even predicted the death of these venerable disciplines altogether. (See<a class="footnote-ref" href="#winterhalter2014"> [winterhalter2014] </a>for a good summary of the issues.)</p>
<p>It is not without a certain irony, then, that one may note that many governments in Asia are, in contrast, investing more than ever now in the humanities, arts, and social sciences. The reasons are complex, but a general need for fostering greater creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship among their populations is an important factor. In the last twenty years, China has established several liberal arts universities and has forged partnerships with liberal arts programs at U.S. universities, such as Duke and NYU<a class="footnote-ref" href="#godwinandpickus2017"> [godwinandpickus2017] </a>, as did Singapore by fostering a collaboration between its established, flagship national university and Yale in the form of the liberal-arts model that was Yale-NUS College<a class="footnote-ref" href="#roth2015"> [roth2015] </a>. Taking inspiration from institutions like MIT, there are also a growing number of specialist science and technology universities with integrated arts, humanities, and social science programs throughout Asia. The prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) are perhaps the oldest examples of adopting this MIT model<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kaur2005"> [kaur2005] </a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> More recently, in 2009, MIT itself helped establish the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) “to advance knowledge and nurture technically-grounded <em>leaders</em> and <em>innovators</em> to serve society needs, with a focus on design, through an <em>integrated multidisciplinary</em> curriculum and <em>multidisciplinary</em> research” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#magnanti2018"> [magnanti2018] </a>.</p>
<p>The very different political and institutional situations facing the humanities worldwide ought to influence the debates and challenges surrounding the digital humanities (DH). However, disciplinary discussions about DH generally assume an academic audience located in American or European institutions and, until recently, have rarely reflected the potential global diversity of the field.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Less remarked upon, perhaps, is that, institutionally, thewhatquestion in DH pedagogy usually speaks to researchers and students in a specific, normative setting: <em>humanities</em> departments and units, while thehowquestion usually pertains only to teaching methods relevant to students pursuing humanities degrees in these departments and units — ignoring the fact that both of these questions about DH could actually have very different answers in different institutional contexts. An approach to these questions that is disciplinarily more inclusive can therefore offer lessons for DH that are not normatively circumscribed by the specificities of the most commonly encountered scenario.</p>
<p>This paper is a step in that direction: we discuss our efforts and those of our colleagues to establish a DH program at SUTD in Singapore, and we address the challenges and rewards of introducing DH to undergraduate students pursuing STEM degrees. This academic environment is unusual for a DH program, but, given that it is becoming more common in Asia, rethinking the question of how to teach DH from the perspective of this setting allows us to critically appraise current pedagogical methods as well as reconsider what DH is or can be, particularly in its relationship with the humanities and computational science.</p>
<h2 id="1-sutd-and-the-digital-humanities-minor">1. SUTD and the Digital Humanities Minor</h2>
<p>SUTD is Singapore’s fourth publicly funded university, and, in its first seven years, the university was run in collaboration with MIT, which helped to develop its unique degree programs and curriculum as well as to establish research centers, such as the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre (IDC)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#magnanti2018"> [magnanti2018] </a>. SUTD has fivepillarsthat offer degree programs that cut across the traditional fields of architecture, engineering, and computer science: Architecture and Sustainable Design (ASD), Design and Artificial Intelligence (DAI, introduced in 2020), Engineering Product Development (EPD), Engineering Systems and Design (ESD), and Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD). Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, or HASS, is a disciplinaryclusterindependent of these pillar programs that offers elective courses to students throughout their undergraduate degrees as well as two core courses in the humanities and social sciences that they take in their first year.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> HASS subjects constitute 22% of our student’s curricular exposure, slightly less than at MIT (25%) due to the specific requirements of Singapore’s Engineering Accreditation Board.</p>
<p>In establishing SUTD’s pillars, MIT introduced a level ofintegrated multidisciplinaritythat is not found in MIT’s schools, which follow traditional disciplinary divisions, such as architecture, engineering, computer science, etc. The HASS cluster, however, was established as a smaller equivalent of MIT’s School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS), perhaps because the latter already embodied a multidisciplinary ethos. Unlike at MIT, all students must take core courses in the humanities and social sciences in their first year as part of a common curriculum before subsequently choosing one compulsory HASS elective each term. MIT also established multidisciplinary teaching weeks where all subjects, including HASS, tackle a common problem from different perspectives. Since the completion of the MIT collaboration in 2017, there has been a further effort to integrate HASS more directly with the pillar subjects in a shift towards a more radically interdisciplinary educational ideal.</p>
<p>Key to this shift are HASS’s new minor programs: a Design, Technology, and Society (DTS) minor and the DH minor. Students minoring in DTS learn to analyze the social dimensions of design and technology using humanistic and social scientific methods, mainly within disciplines such as anthropology, history, psychology, and sociology.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The DH minor has two main goals. The first goal is to teach students how to utilize the tools and techniques of computation to help them analyze and interpret culture. The second goal is to have students think more critically about computation and about digital culture through the lens of the humanities.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Students can sign up for the DH minor at the end of their first year after they have taken the compulsory “Global Humanities” core course that is run on a Great Books model. The students minoring in DH tend to come mainly from those majoring in two computationally focused degrees, Computer Science and Design (offered by the ISTD pillar) and Engineering Systems and Design (offered by its eponymous pillar, ESD). Apart from the humanities core course, they have almost no prior experience in studying the humanities.</p>
<p>All students enrolled in the DH minor begin the program by taking a compulsory introductory DH course. This course focuses mainly on teaching how computational skills can be used to better understand objects of human culture. After this core DH course, the students take four humanities electives in subsequent terms. These electives are of two main types based on the different goals of the DH minor. Some electives focus on the digital world and teach students how to think humanistically about digital methods and culture via such fields as digital and environmental studies. The majority focus on traditional subjects such as history, literature, and philosophy and require students to conduct digital research projects where they use computational methods to investigate an aspect of human culture relevant to the elective.</p>
<h2 id="2-introducing-digital-and-humanities-methods-in-the-classroom">2. Introducing Digital and Humanities Methods in the Classroom</h2>
<p>DH has developed as a field primarily as a result of its common computational methods and approaches. Inevitably, the debates and practices of the discipline have largely focused on exploring the possibilities of these new methods as well as on thinking critically about their applicability in humanities teaching and research. These two sides of the conversation concerning DH have sometimes run into conflict. In the early 2010s, debates emerged about how far the field should be concerned with the humanistic critique of computation in addition to the more practical matter of applying computational methods. Scholar-bloggers sometimes framed this debate on DH approaches as one betweenhack(practice) andyack(theory). While the opposition was never as fundamental as this dichotomy suggests, the distinction between these two sides of DH nevertheless resonated with many digital humanists. (See<a class="footnote-ref" href="#nowviskie2016"> [nowviskie2016] </a>for a brief history of the debate).</p>
<p>Related issues have also tended to structure and define conversations about DH teaching. Introductory courses and workshops in DH, in particular, can often struggle to find a balance between the immediate need to introduce humanities students to computational tools and techniques and that of having them think more critically and abstractly about the ideas that underpin these methods. John Russell and Merinda Hensley have criticized the tendency in DH teaching for “buttonology,” that is, the focus on “showing how to use software” rather than critically engaging with digital methodologies<a class="footnote-ref" href="#russellandhensley2017"> [russellandhensley2017] </a>. (See also<a class="footnote-ref" href="#giannetti2017"> [giannetti2017] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#goldstone2019"> [goldstone2019] </a>). At the same time, there has been a recent push toward placing more emphasis on critical digital pedagogy and digital literacy<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stommeletal2020"> [stommeletal2020] </a>, though many introductory courses in DH remain structured around the use of particular software packages<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stanleyandvandegrift2016"> [stanleyandvandegrift2016] </a>.</p>
<p>Recent debates about the balance of theory and practice have focused almost entirely on the digital side of DH, and there has been relatively little discussion about its relation to the humanities in general or, for that matter, about what humanities methods actually are, not to speak of how such methods can combine pedagogically with computational methods. There is an assumption in many DH courses and workshops that students will intuitively know how to put the computational tools and techniques that are taught to productive use in their research or coursework. Similarly, courses might engage in the critique of digital culture but rarely teach how exactly humanities methods inform this critique.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> This is not to say that DH researchers have not thought about these issues. John Unsworth, for instance, famously argued that computational work in the humanities should support the basic functions of humanities research, which he called “scholarly primitives” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#unsworth2000"> [unsworth2000] </a>. Unsworth pointed to the need for more epistemological reflection on the processes of humanities research so that computational methods could be better integrated with them. Despite the longstanding influence of Unsworth’s article on the field’s self-definition, it is rare to find a systematic discussion of humanities epistemology in DH textbooks and other introductory literature, presumably because it is assumed that their readers would be students in the humanities who are already familiar with it.</p>
<p>This issue became problematic for us when introducing DH to non-humanities students on our foundation course. While all introductory works provide definitions of DH, most speak only in general terms about humanities research and methods, if at all. The exact meaning of terms, such asclose reading, is largely left open to interpretation, perhaps because, as Martin Paul Eve notes, “to many in the field of literary studies this question of what we mean by close reading might seem so obvious as to need no answer” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#eve2019"> [eve2019] </a>. This willingness to leave the methods of one half of DH so loosely defined may go unnoticed in the humanities classroom, but it was an obstacle for some of our students. Variations of the same question kept coming up in our class discussions: “What exactly is meant by humanities research?” It seems obvious to us now, but we had not foreseen how vital this question would be. The students’ primary concern was understanding what humanities knowledge is and how the epistemological framework of the humanities and that of computation could be integrated to produce new humanities knowledge. While thinking about how to address this concern and guide our students, we came to understand that thisoutsiderperspective on humanities epistemology, namely that of STEM students trying to apply DH, also provided an opportunity to demystify humanities epistemology and make it legible to non-humanists.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we have begun to revise our DH core course and some of our electives to better address students’ needs. Rather than focusing on eitherhackoryack, that is, computational methods or the humanistic critique of them, we are instead structuring our DH core syllabus around our own groups of humanistic scholarly primitives that can productively interface with computer science approaches. We base our selection of these scholarly primitives on the principle that humanities research creates new knowledge about objects of human culture by discovering <em>meaningful patterns</em> both within them and between them. Here, we have been inspired both by Rens Bod’s <em>A New History of the Humanities</em> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bod2013"> [bod2013] </a>as well as the work of other DH scholars who have similarly thought about this process as a form of “modeling” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#beynonetal2006"> [beynonetal2006] </a>. We have also benefited from the work of theDM2E (Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana)project, which published a report introducing a revised set of scholarly primitives, the activities based on the primitives, and the specific operations involved in those activities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hennickeetal2015"> [hennickeetal2015] </a>.</p>
<p>We have started to structure the DH core course around three modules. The first module, “analyzing and discovering” , focuses on how we can interpret cultural objects by identifying their formal aspects and the meaningful patterns they make. We focus on both textual objects as well as visual objects and, using works of literature and art, first have the students think about how the interplay of particular words, colors, or shapes of these objects influence how they interpret them. We thus introduce the students to a loose idea of formalism and its epistemological role in the humanities before turning to how these methods can mesh with computational approaches. We then have the students engage each week in simple computational tasks — counting words and pixels at different scales, for instance — to get them to think about the epistemological overlap between intuiting forms versus inferring digital features. In these, we have drawn on inspiration from studies that have highlighted the continuities between French and Russian formalism, in particular, and DH methods (for instance,<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fortier1991"> [fortier1991] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ustinov2016"> [ustinov2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fischeretal2019"> [fischeretal2019] </a>) as well as made use of the more explicit operationalization of the continuity between topic modeling and the precursors of Russian formalism that Matthew Jockers points out in his book <em>Macroanalysis</em> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#jockers2013"> [jockers2013] </a>, parts of which we use as a text for a section of our course.</p>
<p>The second module, “conceptualizing and comparing” , explores how humanities scholars derive new concepts from connections between cultural objects. Researchers in the humanities use the structures that underpin the concepts they employ to help compare different cultural objects. For instance, historians may create and debate the idea of a particular historical period; literature scholars may investigate issues of genre, authorship, and theme; and philosophers may create new forms of metalanguage to represent the different ideas and elements of their reasoning. We have the students try to come up with automated, machine-learning-based computational approaches that complement these humanistic connections. For example, topic modeling can allow students to ascertain how thediscoveryof topics shared between texts by means of quantitative analysis matches up with the intuitive, thematic connections they make between those texts. Standard techniques in textual DH such as stylometry and vector models of the semantics of words and concepts lend themselves particularly well to this kind of pedagogy. The key point here is that, for these STEM students, quantitative analysis is often more easily graspable and can be built on to help them see the importance of humanistic methods of inquiry — especially when quantitative methods fall short, and their limits are exposed.</p>
<p>The final module of the course departs somewhat from previous studies on scholarly primitives and focuses on “creating and generating” as research activities. Here we explore the role of the creative arts, in particular, the literary and visual arts, as a form ofaction research, that is, as a practical and creative means of better understanding the forms and processes of cultural objects<a class="footnote-ref" href="#skains2018"> [skains2018] </a>. As part of this module, students particularly experiment with artificial intelligence and generative art and build on their previous work on the interface between humanities conceptualizing and machine learning of classification. They learn about the capacity of algorithms to create new artistic objects and think critically about how this creative process reflects the cultural archives and datasets on which an algorithm is trained. In some cases, this also enables students to see not only the limitations of computational approaches but also the distortive effects that could ensue if any and all residue that cannot be quantified and computed is automatically devalued (and, conversely, if anything that can be quantified and computed is allowed to lead to what Sareenet al.describe as “performative legitimation” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#sareenetal2020"> [sareenetal2020] </a>).</p>
<p>In subsequent electives, we build on our work in the DH core course by continuing the conversation about epistemological connections between the humanities and computer science. For instance, one of us (S.B.) teaches an elective, “Form and Content in Arts, Science and Society” , that exposes students to concepts from structuralist semiotics by tracing, first, the analogy between the relationality of Saussurean semiotics and the computer scientific notion of semantic fields in the vector-space approach to semantics in text analysis. The course also provides our students with a gentle introduction to post-structuralism by way of Derrida’s “Structure, Sign and Play” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#derrida1970"> [derrida1970] </a>, based on the foundation of that earlier analogy. The operationalization of complex and abstract notions like sign and signification in structuralist semiotics, as well as the foregrounding of the limits to such an operationalization when we get to more complex notions such as post-structuralism and deconstruction, provides a route for our undergraduate students from STEM disciplines into advanced topics in humanities theory that they normally would not have had the means to engage with (and which are challenging even to humanities undergraduates).</p>
<h2 id="3-research-project-centered-pedagogy">3. Research Project Centered Pedagogy</h2>
<p>Teaching DH to students who otherwise have little background in the humanities requires much more attention to research practices than digital tools. Alison Langmead, who has taught DH courses to both humanists and information scientists, has noted that “humanists tend to have an easier time forming a research question, while the information scientists tend to have an easier time becoming familiar with the tools” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#birnbaumandlangmead2017"> [birnbaumandlangmead2017] </a>. Based on this insight, she and David J. Birnbaum have suggested beginning with research questions when teaching humanists and tool application when teaching information scientists. However, in our experience, computer science students can be skeptical about working with digital methods without a clear purpose. We have found that it is important to introduce them first to practical examples of DH research that tackle real questions. Even then, some of the students have echoed Nan Z. Da’s recent criticisms of DH research that “what is robust is obvious (in the empirical sense) and what is not obvious is not robust” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#da2019"> [da2019] </a>. When assigning DH research articles to students, one major challenge then has been to find work that does not simply computationally confirm what is already known ( “the obvious” ) and that also can stand up to scientific scrutiny ( “the robust” , whether in method, statistical analyses, etc.).<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>We have found that introducing students early on to impactful DH research papers is an efficient means of inculcating in them an appreciation of how digital methods support humanistic inquiry. From the start of our introductory DH course, we encourage students to put these theoretical perspectives into practice, and in our weekly seminars, we have them work on focused research problems. In the mid-term and final assignments too, the students design, implement and report on their own research projects. As the course progresses, the scaffolding we give them diminishes until, in the final project, they are encouraged to take the lead as the principal researchers. The confidence and independence the students gain from this allow us to embed DH more firmly within the general humanities curriculum at SUTD. The faculty who run most of the humanities electives that students take subsequently as part of the DH minor are not DH practitioners by training. The DH component of these humanities courses comprises projects that students undertake with little technical supervision. So, it is important that the students develop, early on, the skills to carry out such research projects independently.</p>
<p>Early exposure to the difficulties of devising and executing research projects also helps us dispel a fairly common presumption our STEM-minded students have that DH will be easy for them. We have found that some of the introductory DH literature can reinforce this student bias by overly focusing on the role of play, tinkering, and screwing around<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ramsay2014"> [ramsay2014] </a>. This is not to say that this kind of approach is not valuable. On the contrary, all humanities scholars can vouch for the importance of casual browsing and serendipitous discoveries. It is simply that, as a form of pedagogy, an emphasis onscrewing aroundis probably more effective in a classroom of humanists who may be intimidated by computational methods. As far as possible, we have our students think more carefully about what Andrew Goldstone<a class="footnote-ref" href="#goldstone2019"> [goldstone2019] </a>criticizes as “rationalizations of inconclusive arguments as exploration, play, or productive failure.” As such, we try to have our students focus their research projects on clear objectives relevant and of interest to scholars in humanities disciplines. Rather than downplaying the importance of concrete disciplinary arguments in their projects, we allow our students to learn from and appreciate the “ugly feelings” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#walsh2019"> [walsh2019] </a>that arise in attempting to reach this goal.</p>
<p>The reason why this goal is difficult is that, as Helen Small has recently pointed out, drawing upon the work of Gayatri Spivak<a class="footnote-ref" href="#spivak2009"> [spivak2009] </a>, the qualities by which the humanities claim “distinctive” purpose often tend to be sharply different from the epistemology that practitioners of science and technology are used to. Small points out that the humanities value “qualitative above quantitative reasoning” , “interpretative” above “positivistic” thinking, and historical analysis as much as “synchronic structural analysis.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#small2013"> [small2013] </a>The humanities, she says, distrust “proceduralism” and lay special emphasis on the role of the perceiver “in ascertaining even the most philosophically secure of knowledge claims.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#small2013"> [small2013] </a>As a corollary, it is an individualized response to cultural objects that the humanities value, rather than the lowest common denominator, or statistically averaged, responses<a class="footnote-ref" href="#small2013"> [small2013] </a>.</p>
<p>Centering the DH minor program on research projects is not without challenges. Our students take elective courses mainly (though not exclusively) with non-DH specialists and often tend to have better computational skills than their instructors. This is overall a good thing since students can organically bring into the classroom what they have learned from their degree programs. This leads to a more equitable exchange of ideas between students and instructors in devising projects. As such, the results are often more ambitious and innovative than if the students were to carry out a project determined by their instructor. There is a danger, however, that this teacher-student collaboration can unintentionally turn into a form of compartmentalization<a class="footnote-ref" href="#birnbaumandlangmead2017"> [birnbaumandlangmead2017] </a>, in which the student simply acts as a programmer and the teacher formulates the humanities side of the project. Instructors must remain vigilant that the students give as much time and attention to the humanities question they are investigating as they do to the computational methods they are using. There also can be an additional problem in that the instructors do not always feel comfortable grading a project that employs methods they do not fully understand. As far as possible, we try to mitigate this by having DH specialist faculty available to mentor students and instructors in all phases of their projects.</p>
<p>In carrying out research projects in their elective courses, students also face difficulties designing a feasible project in the month or so they have to complete them. Sometimes students have unrealistic expectations of what they can accomplish and are unable to finish their work. For instance, they often have to spend a lot of time at the beginning of their projects engaging in corpus-building due to the lack of readily available corpora in their areas of interest, which are very diverse — having ranged in recent terms from Southeast Asian science fiction to the philosophy of Heidegger. Sometimes we can mitigate these challenges with better guidance from their instructor and DH specialist mentor. In other cases, we encourage students to design prototypes instead or create proofs of concept. In addition, we are currently experimenting with offering students the opportunity to continue and build upon the projects that their peers started in previous iterations of the elective courses. However, we have found that many students are not as interested in doing this as they like to create something new and feel a sense of personal ownership over their work.</p>
<h2 id="4-global-and-local-digital-humanities">4. Global and Local Digital Humanities</h2>
<p>The lack of datasets and specialized DH tools for many of our Asia-focused humanities electives is part of the more general challenge we face in designing a DH curriculum for a Singaporean and Asian regional context.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> And yet we also consider this to be one of the most meaningful opportunities in building our DH program. DH as a field is fairly new to Singaporean academia<a class="footnote-ref" href="#varelaetal2019"> [varelaetal2019] </a>— our minor is currently the only one on the island — and our program is still finding an “accent” that “recognizes both local specificity and global coherence in DH” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#risam2017"> [risam2017] </a>. This SUTD-specific DH approach will ideally come to reflect our culturally diverse and multilingual student body. A typical classroom at SUTD will consist of around 75% Singaporean students who speak English and Chinese, Malay, Tamil, or other languages as their mother tongue, and around 25% international students, mainly from China, India, Korea, and Southeast Asia. In making our DH curriculum more locally specific, however, we must also work with English as the mandatory medium of instruction in Singaporean universities.</p>
<p>Finding relevant English-language material can be particularly difficult as many English-language DH textbooks and tutorials reflect the Eurocentric research interests of their authors and intended audiences. As such, it can be hard to convince our students that DH’s potential is much broader than the American and British literary canon. This is another reason why we rely much less onstandardDH textbooks and increasingly have our students read research articles that align more with their cultural interests and those of our general humanities curriculum. This can often mean assigning our students regional readings that do not specifically identify as DH research but may be in fields such as data science. Students thus learn to recognize and appreciate regional DH work beyond the purview of U.S. and European academia. For example, in a course taught by one of us (A.G.) on classical South and Southeast Asian literature and art, DH students were introduced to Osaka University’s BUDA.ART project, a collaboration between data scientists and art historians analyzing archives of Buddha statue images<a class="footnote-ref" href="#renoustetal2019"> [renoustetal2019] </a>. This work does not identify as DH, but it serves as a starting point for DH students on the course to create and analyze their own 3D models of museum artifacts.</p>
<p>While our common class readings must be in English, it is sometimes possible to provide non-English course material along with an English translation, particularly in the elective courses. We are also developing our own datasets of Singaporean cultural material, such as political speeches, that we can use for class tutorials instead of American and European datasets. This will be a long-term task since most material in Singapore’s national archives and libraries is not digitized in an easily usable form. In their assignments and class projects, we encourage our students to explore the vast amount of non-English DH scholarship in Asia, particularly in Chinese (see<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mahonyandgao2019"> [mahonyandgao2019] </a>), and devise projects that focus on topics that reflect their own interests. However, students frequently encounter difficulties finding machine-readable data in their research area. They also soon realize that many tools do not support the languages they want to analyze. Furthermore, when dealing with Singaporean English (Singlish), our students often confront the epistemic normativity<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bhattacharyya2017"> [bhattacharyya2017] </a>of tools trained only on American or British English. Faced with these obstacles, we challenge our students to build upon the available tools so that they can deal with the local specificity of their projects. Previously, for instance, we have had students use spaCy to train a sentiment classifier on Singlish to analyze tweets and online reviews. However, this kind of building can be difficult in a small classroom project as it tends to be very time-consuming, and the results are not always readily presentable.</p>
<p>We face a pedagogical challenge, then, that is deeper than simply increasing the diversity of representation in our class materials. It is not enough for us to correct theperceived exclusionsof DH by adapting current DH practices so that they can encompass local cultures. There is a danger that we will simply reproduce U.S. and European DH in a Singaporean context and therefore perpetuate a Eurocentric orientation that has excluded many of the world’s cultures from the field in the first place<a class="footnote-ref" href="#risam2018"> [risam2018] </a>. This is particularly problematic for our research project-based curriculum, where students have sometimes uncritically modeled their Singapore and Asia-focused projects on the topics of American and European DH work on the assumption that these projects represent a universal ideal. In this regard, our students would benefit from greater exposure to critical and postcolonial theory, though we need to be mindful that we do not simply reorientate ourselves towards the theoretical preoccupations of the Global North. In addition, further deepening our engagement with the computational cultural work going on in the region would help expose our students to a productively different set of preoccupations and interests.</p>
<p>Finding our scholarly accent as a Singaporean DH program will involve balancing between connecting with global DH currents and engaging with more local and regional DH work (that may or may not fall within thebig tentof globally defined DH). An important step will be broadening the scope of global DH by allowing for greater diversity in how our students engage with the field. A critical task will be for students and faculty to collaborate to create new datasets and build and modify tools to accommodate the wide variety of cultural interests in the department and student body. At the same time, our program needs to be more actively engaged in shaping a truly de-centered, global DH. There are several steps we plan to immediately take to do this. First, we can reach out to other universities in Southeast Asia and beyond to foster regional teaching and research collaborations. Second, we can establish translation groups among faculty and students to translate DH research in regional languages for use in our courses. Third, we can compile annotated bibliographies of regional DH work and write English-language tutorials and reviews for regional tools and projects that can serve as a resource for ideas in our elective courses and for the global DH community.</p>
<h2 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>SUTD’s DH program represents a new, experimental chapter in DH pedagogy. From the perspective of American and European DH, the challenges we face in establishing an independent DH curriculum outside of a traditional humanities program and within a STEM-focused Asian university are certainly unusual. But as DH becomes more global, the various types of institutional and cultural settings for DH as a field will continue to diversify. We have argued here that this diversity will and must raise important questions for DH as a local and global field. This will involve the challenge and opportunity to rethink both what DH is and how we do it independent of its classroom origins as a parergon to traditional humanities disciplines. Our approach at SUTD is only one of many possibilities, and we hope that this article is a starting point for further discussions about how we can make DH pedagogy more inclusive, particularly within Asian regional and STEM-orientated contexts.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<p>Scholarly workflows in the Digital Humanities can benefit from the application of natural language processing (NLP) tools<a class="footnote-ref" href="#argamon2009"> [argamon2009] </a>. To serve any practical use to DH scholars, these tools must produce accurate and reliable results for the corpus under study, especially when the intent is to provide linguistic annotations that enable syntactic analyses. For historical texts, such an application is non-trivial because pre-trained tools are usually trained over contemporary materials (e.g.,newswirearticles, microblog text, and general books), making any direct application prone to error<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcgillivray2020"> [mcgillivray2020] </a>. For trainable language-agnostic pipelines like UDPipe that provide annotations for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization, and dependency parsing simultaneously using Universal Dependencies (UD), it becomes necessary to train UDPipe from scratch using model training data derived from the historical literary materials<a class="footnote-ref" href="#shirai2020"> [shirai2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#straka2017"> [straka2017] </a>. Developing these UD annotations can be done through manual effort alone or by applying a pre-trained UDPipe model to the raw text and then later post-editing its output manually for errors<a class="footnote-ref" href="#scannell2020"> [scannell2020] </a>. However, the structure of nodes in the dependency tree may also require changing and, for East Asian languages like Chinese and Japanese that can be written without specifying word boundaries other than insertion of punctuation marks, tokenization is often difficult, and thus errors in the tree can be severe when tokenization is inaccurate. Consequently, manual revision can be challenging to carry out in terms of time and expertise needed in working with UD.</p>
<p>Motivated by this issue, the present paper purposes to address the following questions with respect to modern historical Japanese corpora: (1) can accurate UD annotations be developed from scratch using pre-trained tools while also minimizing the amount of manual effort needed for correction, (2) can said generated annotations be used as model training data to achieve improved accuracy on a fundamental NLP task, e.g., word segmentation, (3) does the trained model adapted to historical materials have a substantial effect on the output parsings produced when compared to pre-trained tools, and (4) can the proposed workflow be carried out by non-experts in UD? The answers can be encouraging to DH scholars working with historical corpora who are not subject experts in UD, but would like to make more frequent use of linguistic metadata in their scholarship.</p>
<p>To attempt an answer, this paper introduces a rule-based workflow for modern historical Japanese corpora that produces more accurate UD annotations directly from the raw text in the corpus using the output of pre-trained tools as a starting point. It consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>text normalization</em> step using handcrafted rules to normalize historical lexical variants to a more canonical form so that the input text may receive a more accurate parsing by a pre-trained model, and</li>
<li>An <em>assignment</em> step in which these annotations are linked with word forms in the original text.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, any parser that learns their model from this data also learns how to deal with historical text.</p>
<h2 id="2-related-work">2. Related Work</h2>
<p><a class="footnote-ref" href="#shirai2020"> [shirai2020] </a>proposes a related workflow to reduce the amount of manual effort needed for correcting sentence boundaries in modern historical Japanese materials maintained by the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics (NINJAL)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ninjal2021"> [ninjal2021] </a>. Their method trains a combination of UDPipe and CRF++ usingcore datamanually corrected by experts to predict sentence boundaries on unlabeled data. Our approach also corrects UD annotations, but aims to do so automatically and does not use anygold-standardor already corrected data as a starting point.</p>
<p>Text normalization is a well-known preprocessing problem in NLP with many proposed solutions. For Japanese text normalization,<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ikeda2016"> [ikeda2016] </a>presents a deep learning encoder-decoder model for normalizing Japanese social media and microblog text. Our approach uses text normalization in the context of historical text, which has received recent attention in Bollmann’s survey though Japanese is not covered specifically<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bollman2019"> [bollman2019] </a>. Moreover, the goal of our approach is not historical text normalization and involves it only as an intermediary step as part of a larger workflow that aims to provide accurate UD annotations to modern historical Japanese text.</p>
<h2 id="3-methods">3. Methods</h2>
<h2 id="31-data-source-and-model-selection">3.1. Data Source and Model Selection</h2>
<p>We follow<a class="footnote-ref" href="#shirai2020"> [shirai2020] </a>and adopt the Taiyo (太陽) magazine published by Hakubunkan and maintained by NINJAL as a historical corpus of written Japanese<a class="footnote-ref" href="#maekawa2006"> [maekawa2006] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ninjal2021"> [ninjal2021] </a>. Taiyo was the best-selling general-interest magazine of the time, consisting of 3400 articles written by about 1000 writers published during the Meiji (明治) and Taisho (大正) periods between the years 1895 and 1925. Chief among the reasons for its selection in this study is the challenge the corpus presents computationally because it reflects the dramatic changes in literary and colloquial writing styles that were occurring at that time with both styles sometimes coexisting within the same article. Therefore, Taiyo is representative of the kinds of historical corpora humanities scholars regularly deal with.</p>
<p>To evaluate our methods, we also incorporate three other magazines made available by NINJAL in its corpora of Modern Japanese: Josei (女性) (1894 - 1925), Meiroku Zasshi (鳴鹿) (1874 - 1875), and Kokumin (國民) (1887 - 1888)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#tanaka2012"> [tanaka2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ninjal2021"> [ninjal2021] </a>. Table 1 shows the distribution of punctuation and sentences across the four collections according to the NINJAL markup.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The Meiroku and Kokumin collections are especially valuable to this study as NINJAL has further adorned the text with morphological information in the form of short-word units (SUWs).<br>

GiNZA is a recent open-source NLP framework that advertises as an easyone-stopsolution for providing tokenization, part of speech tagging, and dependency analysis on Japanese text simultaneously and enjoys popularity among NLP researchers<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ginza2021"> [ginza2021] </a>. It can also supply output in CoNLL-U format which can be used to train pipelines like UDPipe to fulfill fundamental NLP tasks, e.g., word segmentation<a class="footnote-ref" href="#nivre2016"> [nivre2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#straka2017"> [straka2017] </a>. However, its parsing model is trained on a portion of UD Japanese BCCWJ – an annotated corpus of contemporary Japanese – and, therefore, is unsuitable for historical Japanese corpora<a class="footnote-ref" href="#maekawa2014"> [maekawa2014] </a>. This makes GiNZA a candidate for use as a pre-trained tool in our study.</p>
<h2 id="32-workflow">3.2. Workflow</h2>
<p>We present the workflow used by our research to produce improved UD metadata directly from the raw sentences of the Taiyo corpus. Three steps organize the work: (1) a development phase where a set of handcrafted rules is generated to normalize portions of the historical text, (2) a text normalization phase that then applies the rule set to fulfill the needed transformation, and (3) application of GiNZA to the normalized text followed by an alignment step that assigns the UD metadata generated to word forms from the historical text. These steps are realized by means of a Python script, which we have made available through GitHub at<a href="https://github.com/jerrybonnell/Rules2UD">https://github.com/jerrybonnell/Rules2UD</a>. We have also provided a Binder link through this repository that launches a live Jupyter notebook in an executable environment so that users can interact with the tool without needing to install any packages on their machine.</p>
<h2 id="321-overview">3.2.1. Overview</h2>
<p>Before proceeding to describe our workflow in detail, we offer a brief overview of the dichotomy between symbolic and non-symbolic approaches, and how both are combined into a single workflow in the proposed work. The developed collection of rules used for producing normalized text can be viewed as anexpert systemthat generates direct applications of domain knowledge for decision-making tasks. A salient aspect of this system is that rule application is a symbolic transformation: a sequence of symbols is substituted with another sequence where the symbols compose written language as either ASCII (e.g.,a,z,+), UTF-8 unicode (e.g.,あ,タ,勉), or numerals (e.g.,0,2,3), and the representations before and after the substitution support human comprehension. In contrast, non-symbolic systems in the form of pretrained language models like GiNZA transform raw text into an internal numerical representation (e.g., word embeddings, contextual word embeddings, etc.) through means of deep learning that, while necessary for its computation and effective for achieving state-of-the-art across NLP benchmarks, obstructs any meaningful interpretation as per current methods<a class="footnote-ref" href="#qiu2020"> [qiu2020] </a>. A system, then, that were to make use of both symbolic and non-symbolic approaches simultaneously would be difficult to achieve because the representations are incompatible.</p>
<p>However, if the expert system is allowed to carry out its work as a separate preprocessing step and the language model follows with its own independent computation, then the language model can take advantage of any symbolic transformations made by the expert system when receiving its input, thereby guiding its own computation. While the representations used during that computation are no longer symbolic, the output returns to a representation that is, which can again be used by the expert system for further postprocessing to complete the required annotation. By making these interactions indirect, the systems can inform one another effectively. This approach forms the basis for the workflow presented here.</p>
<h2 id="322-phase-i-rule-development">3.2.2. Phase I: Rule Development</h2>
<p>We define a rule as some mapping between two word forms, a historical usage and a normalized usage. A collection of rules is a set of these mappings which, in implementation, is a Python dictionary of key-value pairs. We generate rules by manual evaluation of the GiNZA output to identify errors in the parsing that occur primarily because of historical usages. For instance, a significant portion of the rule set are character substitutions, mapping historical kanjis presently rare in use (called Kyukanji 旧漢字), e.g., 黨, to contemporary usages (called Shinkanji 新漢字), e.g., 党. Also included are substitutions of 「わ行」Hiragana and 「ワ行」Katakana to their modern forms, e.g, changing「ゐ」to「い」. A key feature of this evaluation is that only the FORM field is considered for correction and no review time is given to the HEAD and DEPREL fields that form the dependency tree, reducing the overall amount of manual effort needed.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> We have crafted approximately 600 rules under this approach using only the Taiyo corpus as a data source. Figure 1 shows an example output from the GiNZA tool with its associated dependency structure. The transliteration of the sentence is as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>社 會 の 發達 に 從ふ て、 sha kai no hattatsu ni shitagou te
</code></pre><p>The fourth component consists of two characters. The first character of the pair is ordinarily pronouncedhatsu, but when combined with the next character, which is pronouncedtatsu, the pronunciation changes to its shortened versionha-, thereby yieldinghattatsuinstead ofhatsutatsu. The sixth component also contains the modification in the pronunciation. The first character is nornally pronouncedshitaga, but whenふis attached, the pronunciation changes toshitagoand the pronunciation ofふchanges fromhutou.The encoded dependency tree given by the HEAD and DEPREL fields is shown using the CoNLL-U viewer tool<a class="footnote-ref" href="#straka2021"> [straka2021] </a>. The fields FEATS and DEPS specified by the CoNLL-U format are not supplied by GiNZA and the MISC field is omitted for sake of presentation. A curious result is the treatment of the first two characters社會, which meanssociety.</p>

</figure>
<p>Because some rules can be general, a global pattern match-and-replace could be too aggressive and prone to error. To overcome this, the rule set is partitioned into disjoint sets so that some rules may apply only after a condition is met. For instance,つた→った. may trigger only when the word formつたappears after some kanji. Table 3 shows the different rule sets and distribution.<br>

Rule sets are expressed as conditions needed for application, e.g., rules in KANJI + * may only fire if the historical word form (denoted by wildcard *) is preceded by some kanji.Set / ConditionProportionExampleGlobal rules93%假令 → たと, 舊 → 旧KANJI + <em>5%はら → わら, へば → えばHIRAGANA + * + {さ, し, す, せ, そ}0.8%照し → 照らし</em> + ¬HIRAGANA0.8%假令い → たとえHIRAGANA + *0.3%がよい→ が良い¬KANJI + <em>0.3%大なる → 大いなる</em> + KANJI0.2%亦た → また</p>
<h2 id="323-phase-ii-text-normalization">3.2.3. Phase II: Text Normalization</h2>
<p>This step receives as input a single sentence from the target corpus and returns the sentence after normalization. Each rule set is visited in turn for possible applications. If a match is found and meets the condition of the group, the word form is replaced by the value in the rule’s key-value pair. The procedure builds state about the match in a list ofstartandendindex pairs; this information is stored in a dictionary and is needed for successful alignment of UD annotations to the historical word forms in the proceeding step. Following is a breakdown showing an example sentence, two matches, and the corresponding normalized output:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;其 れ で 寧 ろ 小 黨* 分 立 で 行 く 所 ま で 行 く が* よ* い*&#34; so re de mushi ro shou tou* bun ritsu de i ku tokoro ma de i ku ga* yo* i* 黨 → 党 (global rule), がよい → が良い (hiragana + * rule) {&#39;黨&#39;: [(6, 6)], &#39;がよい&#39;: [(17, 19)]} &#34;其 れ で 寧 ろ 小 党* 分 立 で 行 く 所 ま で 行 く が* 良* い&#34;* so re de mushi ro shou tou* bun ritsu de i ku tokoro ma de i ku ga* yo* i*
</code></pre><p>This sentence contains one historical word form, 黨, and an ambiguous character sequence がよい. The former is normalized to the form 党. The latter in this context can be spelled as が良い with the use of one kanji. The alternate form is「通い」, which is normally pronounced as 「かよい」, but in the case where it is preceded by a general noun representing a commercial location, pronounced as 「がよい」. The former is a global rule while the latter may only trigger if the word form is preceded by a hiragana. This normalized sentence is ready for submission to GiNZA for parsing, which returns UD metadata in CoNLL-U format.</p>
<h2 id="324-phase-iii-aligning-ud-metadata">3.2.4. Phase III: Aligning UD Metadata</h2>
<p>The fundamental problem with the CoNLL-U output returned by GiNZA in the previous step is that the UD annotations supplied are for the <em>normalized</em> text and not the <em>historical</em> text. Meaning, any model trained using the normalized output loses information about lexical variation and, consequently, is ill-suited for direct application on the historical text. Therefore, we desire a procedure that aligns <em>normalized</em> UD annotations with the <em>historical</em> word forms present in the source sentence.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The state built up during the match is brought forward to this step to determine the start-end locations where the alignment should occur in the word forms given in the FORM field. Once found, the historical form is referenced from the state dictionary to string replace the normalized form identified by the start-end pair. This aligns the historical word form with the normalized UD annotation.</p>
<p>However, the alignment is complicated by nature of tokenization: the normalized word form that needs to be replaced may not be contained within a single row of the FORM field. This yields two scenarios when doing the alignment:</p>
<p>the normalized word form is contained within a single row, andthe normalized word form spans multiple rows in the FORM field</p>
<p>We envisage each row as containing two parts: a part that is not influenced by the normalization (part A) and a part that is (part B). The two scenarios are demonstrated using the GiNZA output from the example sentence in the previous step.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>其れで寧ろ小 <strong>党</strong> 分立で行く所まで行く <strong>が</strong>  <strong>良い</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario #1: the normalized form 党.</strong> The start-end pair (6,6) identifies 小 as the part not influenced by normalization (part A) and 党 as the part that is (part B). The normalized form is fully contained by the row and, therefore, string replacing 党 with 黨 completes the alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2: the normalized form が良い.</strong> The start-end pair (17, 19) identifies part A empty and part B to be split across two rows, rows 11 and 12. To help make informed decisions, we use the normalized GiNZA output to guide the character lengths to maintain for each row. Meaning, the lengths of each normalized row should remain unchanged after the alignment is completed.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> For row 11 in the example, this means string replacing が with just the first character from the historical word form, which happens to also be が. Proceeding on to the next row, the remaining characters to be aligned are now contained within a single row – a Scenario #1 case. In other examples where this is not true, the operation of Scenario #2 is repeated.</p>

<p>There is a possibility for conflicts to arise during processing. Two main issues are addressed here: (1) overlapping rules, and (2) rows withblankforms.</p>
<h2 id="331-overlapping-rules">3.3.1. Overlapping Rules</h2>
<p>There are scenarios where multiple rules can fire on the same historical word form or portions of it. These are usually due to the large number of kanji substitution rules in the rule set. This introduces undefined behavior as the alignment step is unable to determine which rule should have precedence and be applied first. The following gives an example of such a case with two rules that overlap:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>將* た 又 軍 港 な り ha* ta mata gun kou na ri candidate rule #1: 將*た又 → 果て又 candidate rule #2: 將* → 将
</code></pre><p>The second rule is a simple substitution of a traditional kanji character with a modern character. The first rule is a bit of ahackwhere the second character 「た」, pronouncedta,is substituted with 「て」, pronouncedte.The application of the first rule thus changes it to a more modern way of communicating the same meaning at the cost of changing the pronounciation.</p>
<p>We define two or more rules to beoverlappingwhen the ranges of the indices covered by the historical forms to be substituted overlap. When a rule is fully covered by another rule, that is, its historical form is fully contained by the historical form of another rule, the covered rule is jettisoned from application as it is assumed that longer rules are more specific – and, hence, more useful – thangeneralshort rules like kanji substitution rules. The above is an example of such a scenario where candidate rule #2 is a kanji substitution rule and is removed from processing.</p>
<p>Some scenarios can be more complex when the historical form is not covered by another rule, as in the following example. The seventh character of this sentence 「か」 is normally pronouncedka,but the traditional (early modern period) spelling, with the succeeding character 「う」(u), forces the pronunciation 「こ」instead.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>働 く べ き に 働 か う と す る hatara ku be ki ni hatara ko* u to su ru candidate rule #1: か*う → こう candidate rule #2: 働か* → 働
</code></pre><p>When the simple deletion technique above is no longer applicable, we form non-conflicting combinations of rules that also maximize the number of rules to include. Only two exist for this example: {かう} and {働か}. To determine which to use for processing, each combination is scored along four axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of rows in the CoNLL-U table returned by GiNZA.</li>
<li>Number of rows with abad reading,that is, the reading given in the MISC field does not contain a katakana pronunciation (e.g.,日本 instead of ニホン).</li>
<li>Number of rules present in the combination.</li>
<li>A normalized value giving theagreement percentagein the BLEX, CLAS, and MLAS metrics by comparing the aligned accuracy parsing from a combination against that with no rule application<a class="footnote-ref" href="#zeman2018"> [zeman2018] </a>.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Lower values denote more difference which shows that the rule combination exhibits a larger effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination with a minimum score is selected for processing. If multiple minima exist, the instance is flagged for inspection. However, this has not occurred during our experiments with the rule set applied as of this writing.</p>
<h2 id="332-rows-with-empty-forms">3.3.2. Rows with Empty Forms</h2>
<p>Situations can arise where there are not enough characters in the historical word form tofillthe rows spanned by the normalized word form. In the following example sentence, the normalized form而かして(or, alternatively,しこうして) spans the first four rows of the FORM field in the CoNLL-U output returned by GiNZA.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>而* て* 移 轉 せ ら れ た る 繪 畫 は shikoushi* te* i ten se ra re ta ru kai ga ha rule: 而て → 而かして FORM field from CoNLL-U output: 1 而 2 て 3 4
</code></pre><p>Only two characters from the historical form are available to distribute among four rows, which results in the alignment step after completion leaving the third and fourth rows in the FORM field empty. While the issue seems like implementation error, it points to a problem with the rule itself: the normalized form is not helpful in guiding GiNZA to a more accurate parse that sees 而かして as a single word form, hence the tokenization into multiple rows. The solution is an adjustment of the normalized form in the rule, e.g., changing 而かして to 而して. This yields a parse where the normalized form spans a single row, is more accurate, and allows the alignment step to proceed without error.</p>
<h2 id="4-results">4. Results</h2>
<p>This section evaluates the rule set introduced by this research along three criteria:<br>
generalization of rules crafted from the Taiyo corpus to other similar corpora,the effect of the rules on the CoNLL-U output when compared to a parsing without rule application, andevaluating the performance of a word segmentation task when training a NLP pipeline using the proposed rule set.</p>
<h2 id="41-generalization-to-other-corpora">4.1. Generalization to Other Corpora</h2>
<p>Figure 2 shows the top 10 most frequently applied rules in the Taiyo corpus, and the frequency of application for said rules across the other three corpora.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Overall, we observe fair representation of the Taiyo rules in the other corpora. These rules make up roughly, on average, a quarter of applications with respect to the other corpora, with the other three contributing about evenly to the remaining 75% of application. Indeed, some rules saw disproportionately more application in Taiyo than in other corpora, e.g., ‘會’ saw over 30% application in Taiyo while only 10% in Meiroku. The character as a noun meansgroupand as a verb meansto meet. The use of the character is used mostly in the former sense. The difference in the frequency is due to the fact that Taiyo speaks more frequently about groups (specifically, political parties and groups) than Meiroku.</p>
<h2 id="42-effect-on-conll-u-output">4.2. Effect on CoNLL-U Output</h2>
<p>If the proposed approach is to be successful in bringing improvement to a fundamental NLP task like word segmentation, it must first have an observable effect on the resulting parsings generated by GiNZA. This is especially critical when evaluating the method against unlabeled corpora like Taiyo where it is not possible to compare predictions made with any ground truth labels. In the absence of ground truth, visualizing disagreements in CoNLL-U output between the proposed approach and what a pre-trained tool would normally generate can showcase whether any effect can be seen in the output and the quantity of that difference. If the answer is in the positive, then this raises the possibility for improved performance on the historical materials.</p>
<p>To evaluate this, CoNLL-U output with and without rule application is compared across the 4 corpora using the BLEX, CLAS, and MLAS metrics as defined in<a class="footnote-ref" href="#zeman2018"> [zeman2018] </a>. The proposed rules are gradually introduced into the collection before application, and a test is done at every 10% interval. Rules are selected according to frequency, with most frequently occurring rules introduced last. Because of the large corpus size and the repetition of this test at multiple intervals, a random sample of 1,000 sentences is selected to avoid incurring high computation costs. This process is repeated 10 times and the mean disagreement percentage over the 10 runs, derived from the aligned accuracy score given by<a class="footnote-ref" href="#zeman2018"> [zeman2018] </a>, is reported. Figure 3 shows these results.</p>

Each test selects a random sample of 1,000 sentences for comparison and the test is repeated 10 times. The mean score is reported and error bars are given at 99% significance.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We observe a gradual increase in disagreement with the original parsing as more rules are introduced, with the maximum disagreement at full rule usage reaching 22.8% in the BLEX metric from the Taiyo corpus and the minimum 12.8% in the CLAS metric from Josei. BLEX results yield the highest disagreements because of the strict conditions it places on the two CoNLL-U files being compared, relative to the other two metrics. Despite frequent rules being introduced last, the amount of disagreement begins to plateau when rule usage approaches the complete rule set; this could be an artefact of character substitution rules that, while frequently applied, have minimal effect on the dependency structure.</p>
<h2 id="43-improving-word-segmentation">4.3. Improving Word Segmentation</h2>
<p>We evaluate whether the observed effect on the dependency structure of the CoNLL-U output can bring an improvement in a basic NLP task in word segmentation using UDPipe. The test is performed by comparing three experimental set-ups:<br>
a pre-trained UDPipe model trained on UD Japanese-GSD, a UD resource curated from Japanese Wikipedia<a class="footnote-ref" href="#asahara2018"> [asahara2018] </a>;a UDPipe model trained over GiNZA CoNLL-U output using Taiyo documents without any rule application; anda UDPipe model trained identically but with the addition of rule application.</p>
<p>The training data is prepared using five-fold cross-validation over the documents in the Taiyo corpus where the testing fold is not used due to lack of word-level metadata. Instead, the trained models are tested against documents from the Kokumin and Meiroku collections which supply short word unit (SUW) annotations and can be used for ground truth. Figure 4 shows an example of the SUW tag for two tokens in the Kokumin corpus,陛下and及び.The experiment is repeated 10 times for the two setups with and without rule application. In total, 101 different models are evaluated.</p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of XML code" src=""

</figure>
<p>In keeping with the methods proposed in<a class="footnote-ref" href="#shirai2020"> [shirai2020] </a>, our evaluation scheme measures correctness ofBlabel estimation using the metrics precision, recall, and F1. However, we adjust the meaning of theBlabel to meanstart of tokenandIlabel asrest of token. Predictions using the tokenizer option in UDpipe are compared with theBandItruth labels derived from the SUW tags in Meiroku and Kokumin. Figure 5 reports the results.</p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="Image of a bar chart with bars in pink, orange, and yellow. The pink is the model, the orange is false, and yellow is true" src=""
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw"

     ><figcaption>
        <p>Mean precision, recall, and F1 scores on a word segmentation task on the Meiroku and Kokumin corpora using the tokenizer option in UDPipe and comparing against SUW annotations supplied by NINJAL. Three UDPipe set-ups are evaluated: a pretrained model (PRETRAINED), a model trained over 5-fold cross-validated GiNZA CoNLL-U output from Taiyo documents (FALSE), and a model trained identically but with addition of the proposed rule application approach (TRUE). Error bars are reported with 99% significance.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Significant improvements obtained using rule application are in precision and F1. For Kokumin, thetruemodel gives a 3.4% improvement in precision and a 1.7% improvement in F1 over thefalsemodel, and a 7.5% improvement in precision and a 9.3% improvement in F1 over the pretrained model. For Meiroku, thetruemodel gives a 3.4% improvement in precision and a 1.7% improvement in F1 over thefalsemodel, and a 7.0% improvement in precision and a 10.2% improvement in F1 over the pretrained model. We emphasize the improvements brought by precision as being most significant as tokenizations that are inaccurate often produce many tokens (i.e.,Blabels) that result in high recall but low precision.</p>
<h2 id="5-discussion">5. Discussion</h2>
<p>Indeed, some management of the rule set is needed to achieve an observable improvement. The proposed workflow is not totally automatic and care is needed to ensure rules that are introduced into the collection do in fact lead to more accurate parsings produced by GiNZA (or a pretrained tool of choice) and that overlapping rules do not produce a condition where multiple minima exist. Problems with the former usually present as rows with empty forms that can be detected with ease. Moreover, the amount of manual time needed for review is still reduced as the reviewer need only to concentrate review on the FORM field to obtain improved dependency parsings on historical materials.</p>
<p>While the proposed workflow has an effect on the CoNLL-U output produced by GiNZA and said effects bring a significant improvement in precision and F1 forB-label word estimation, the results also point toward a need for developing mechanisms that facilitate expansion of the rule collection that, in turn, furthers the changes made to the dependency structure in the CoNLL-U output; this has the potential to bring more improvement in the performance of trainable NLP pipelines like UDPipe on fundamental NLP tasks for historical materials.</p>
<p>Perhaps one step in this direction are NLP methods that can flag instances of pretrained output with inaccurate parsings that need review, thereby allowing easier rule introduction. Alternatively, another approach is to orient the research towards automatic rule inferencing that pave the path for rapid expansion of the current rule collection. One possibility is to allow forrule chaining,that is, the application of one rule that triggers the application of one or more new rules that were not directly applicable on the original sentence. Furthermore, methods from deep learning like the encoder-decoder model shown in<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ikeda2016"> [ikeda2016] </a>offer rich potential for automatic inferecing. These research directions are appealing, however, caution must be exercised to avoid developing methods that are exciting computationally but offer little to the DH scholars that make use of them<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcgillivray2020"> [mcgillivray2020] </a>. Therefore, any NLP tool developed for the purpose of aiding analysis with historical materials must first work for the DH corpus at hand.</p>
<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this work we introduced a rule-based workflow for providing improved UD annotations to historical Japanese corpora. The principal advantage of our approach is that nogold standarddata is required for training data development, only the availability of a pre-trained model in the target language. Moreover, the amount of time needed for post-editing pre-trained model output is significantly reduced as the reviewer need only to develop rules that address problems in the FORM field and the review does not require deep expertise in UD. We showed that thischeaperreview strategy exhibits an effect on the dependency structure in the CoNLL-U output and, furthermore, brings an improvement in the performance of trainable language-agnostic NLP pipelines like UDPipe on word segmentation tasks.</p>
<p>These results are encouraging to DH scholars who would like to enhance their scholarship by annotating historical materials with linguistic metadata that is customizable and more reliable than what would be possible by the straightforward application ofoff-the-shelftools. Future work will do well to further expedite the manual review needed to achieve good results on the target corpus by incorporating methods that flag pretrained output that is inaccurate and allow automatic rule inferencing. We also caution against the development of techniques that could be interesting for a venue in NLP but offers little for the scholar that would use said techniques on a target DH corpus.</p>

<p>The four collections make available metadata that classifies articles as eithercolloquialorformal.Because the goal of this work is to verify whether a rule-based approach can bring any improvement in UD annotations for historical text, the incorporation of colloquial works makes assessing the efficacy of the approach more difficult to gauge. Therefore, we make exclusive use of formal materials during all experiments presented here. Nevertheless, the rules constructed here (e.g., character substitution rules) are applicable to the colloquial portion and new rules can always be generated by manual analysis of the colloquial texts; these would not be in opposition to the current ruleset developed from the formal texts.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>“Every country gets the circus it deserves. Spain gets bullfights. Italy gets the Catholic Church. America gets Hollywood.” Erica Jong (1977), <em>How to Save Your Own Life</em> , 171<br>
The annual<a href="https://adho.org/">Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO)</a>conference is, for many digital humanities scholars, the one event in the academic calendar at which their research can be appreciated in all its interdisciplinary glory.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The slow and uneven uptake of digital research methods in many traditional humanities disciplines makes the conference a place of refuge for some; an opportunity tonerd outwith like-minded colleagues despite otherwise evident differences in academic backgrounds. The Digital Humanities (DH) conference in this sense has adopted something of aBig Tentethos (indeed, this was the official conference theme of DH2011); it is a meeting site where a wide spectrum of scholarship can be articulated and heard.</p>
<p>The metaphor of theBig Tenthas been debated as a defining feature of the digital humanities itself. In one of the earliest of theBig Tentreflections, William Pannapacker momentarily switches metaphors to ponder, “The digital humanities may seem like a lifeboat amid the wreckage of higher education in the humanities, but it’s not large enough to hold everyone who’s still in the water” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#pannapacker2011b"> [pannapacker2011b] </a>. For Pannapaker, the question of inclusion at the DH conference is one ofscale(however impossible that may seem to resolve). But as Ethan Watrall has noted, the issue is also one ofcurationor gatekeeping: “Whatever the perspective on the Big Tent, the metaphor has inevitably led to debate as to who is in this tent and who is not” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#watrall2016"> [watrall2016] </a>. Watrall focuses his attention on the absence of relevant disciplines, in particular archaeology, at the annual event. Others have taken digital humanities data techniques and applied them to the conference itself to assess just how encompassing the Big Tent really is.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In their article “What’s Under the Big Tent?” Scott Weingart and Nickoal Eichmann find that, although the conference has consistently grown, this expansion has not necessarily equated to a commensurate increase in the diversity of topics, disciplines, or participants<a class="footnote-ref" href="#weingart_etal2017"> [weingart_etal2017] </a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data show that over the last decade, ADHO’s international conference has become slightly more collaborative and regionally diverse, that text and literature currently reign supreme, and that women are underrepresented with no signs of improvement thus far.</p>

<p>As Élika Ortega noted in “Zonas de Contacto: A Digital Humanities Ecology of Knowledges,” there is a “latent tension between the digital humanities that takes place in the centers of gravity, such as the Digital Humanities annual conference…and the digital humanities that is happening outside of such centers” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ortega2019"> [ortega2019] </a>.</p>
<p>As the largest and most recognized global conference in the field of digital humanities, it is critical to reflect on what it is the conference is supposed to <em>do</em> , and who and what it is <em>for</em> ? As more digital humanities conferences emerge with various national, regional, linguistic, thematic, disciplinary, methodological, and other foci, we believe that our international organization should rethink the point of the conference through the perspective of diversity, equity, inclusion and decolonization. Similarly, the conference’s stated purpose for “the benefit of its members and for the advancement of research and scholarship in the variety of disciplines and professions they represent” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#adhoc"> [adhoc] </a>is overdue for a reconsideration that centers justice rather than merit, equity rather than innovation, polyvocality rather than canons, differences rather than standards, and inclusion rather than gatekeeping. This article provides guidelines as a basis for future conference organizers to shape upcoming conferences.</p>
<p>Such a reconceptualization of the conference has the potential to strengthen the diversity of the field from its very foundation, not just as a factor of language or nationality.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Further, an approach to conference organizing based on these principles would also clarify what position the ADHO conference occupies in the growing (and sometimes conflicting) ecology of digital humanities conferences. To allow “Digital Cultural Empowerment” (DH2014), to encourage “Global Digital Humanities” (DH2015), to address “Digital Identities: the Past and the Future” (DH2016), to provide “Access/Accès” (DH2017), to build “Bridges/Puentes” (DH2018), to consider “Complexities” (DH2019), to meet at “Carrefours/Intersections” (DH2020): these official themes of DH conferences past all speak in support of the principles that we advocate here, but that we argue have been implemented inconsistently and with varying degrees of success. The realities of the conference processes do not always align with the themes.</p>
<p>The DH conference represents the good intentions of many actors (ADHO organizations, program committee, local organizers, and so forth) to welcome people to the conference and expand the digital humanities community. And yet, despite these best motivations, the conference suffers high levels of inaccessibility, language restrictions, poor distribution of knowledge and lost research. The cost of the conference is high, as is true of almost all such academic events - not just fiscally but also environmentally (all those air fuel miles&hellip;) and personally for those who give up valuable years of an academic life to deliver an event of limited or uncertain personal and community benefit. Indeed it might be argued that the real, underlying work that the conference does is to create curriculum vitae lines that recognize service rather than meet the intellectual needs of the field.</p>
<p>In the shadows, behind the conference tent is an opaque, hierarchically regulated, global bureaucracy which distributes decision-making in ways that make meaningful interventions for change difficult to imagine. Which bodies answer to whom? Who can assert their authority and in which contexts? When something goes wrong, who takes responsibility for answering the emails, and who addresses the issue publicly? When something goes right, who gets the credit?</p>
<p>We write and reflect on these questions as a group of digital humanities practitioner-scholars who have experienced the vagaries of the annual ADHO conference organization first hand. In this article, we use our front-row insights to explore the ways in which the conference is articulated, organized, and facilitated through conference protocols and processes. The conference protocols, which are bureaucratic documents established to guide the conference process, outline workflows and encode the principles of the organization. The essay generally follows the temporal flow of the conference organization process, but a number of crucial value-based themes (probably the most central themes of this essay) are woven throughout: multilingualism; equity, representation, and diversity; visibility and labor issues; and others. We start with a brief presentation of these themes, then point back to them throughout the essay as they arise in the course of conference organization.</p>
<p>While some aspects of the international DH conference exist because they have been thoughtfully decided by multiple committees, other elements are retained because of past practice. There is an assumption written into the conference processes that conference committee members, authors, and participants are familiar with the protocols and will be held to them equally. The reality is that few are familiar with the protocols at the level needed to have a seamless conference process. A lack of transparency in how ADHO and its conference works is also deeply felt by many digital humanities community members. Although efforts have been made to remediate a general lack of understanding of just how ADHO functions, this continues to be an issue. This essay challenges us to reflect not only on past practice but also on what should be carried forward — and what changes could be made to better reflect the values discussed here. Throughout the essay, we detail how issues such as equity around gender and representation, and multilingualism play out within the ADHO Digital Humanities conference space. We recognize that these two threads are not inclusive of all forms of equity and representation including race, ability, sexuality, ethnicity, class and all the intersectional dimensions of these that are articulated in the conference process. However, multilingualism and gender have received extensive attention from ADHO officers, conference organizers, and attendees. As such, we launch our analysis by positing that equity, particularly gender equity and multilingual representation, are not questions of proportional representation where the conference should reflect genderbalanceorproportionalparticipation from the various multilingual constituencies. Rather, conference organizers should discuss what constitutes gender equity and make the results of that conversation public. Equity should, of course, be based on reparative action and restorative approaches to conference organization. These actions and approaches would require identification of all who have been harmed in previous conference work, conference attendance, and the spheres of influence created through conference processes.</p>
<p>ADHO, as with many other scholarly organizations, is driven by unpaid volunteers who work diligently to create a scholarly community and an international conference that reflect the current trends and advances in scholarship. This article recognizes this scholarly labor while also pointing to the structural challenges that these volunteers face. It suggests that conference organizing is not merely an act of service but is a scholarly activity that should be treated as such. From this perspective, then, we are obligated to study and critique the conference as a site of cultural production. The issues we discuss here are grounded in the digital humanities but speak to broader academic practice within academic conferences. Acknowledging these complicated challenges is the first step to rectifying them in order to create an equitable and welcoming environment for conference organizers and attendees alike.</p>

<p>Despite their centrality to academic communication, circulation of research, and their use as a measure of prestige within tenure and promotion dossiers, academic conferences are an understudied sociological phenomenon. Some publications about conferences are conference reports that reflect on the events and programs of a given conference; other publications consider the practical elements such as “value, management, timing, program, people, protection, scaffolds, and money” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#pedaste_etal2021"> [pedaste_etal2021] </a>.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> The little research on conferences as sites of academic knowledge production centers on four key functions: “intellectual communication, professional socialization, the reproduction of academic status hierarchies, and the legitimation of new subfields or paradigms” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gross_etal2011"> [gross_etal2011] </a>. The sociologists Cole and Cole pay attention to the fact that intellectual communications allocate more status and prestige to some members of the academic community than to others<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cole_etal1974"> [cole_etal1974] </a>. Miné de Klerk points to academic conferences as sites of networking that lead to “academic career advance, to spark research collaborations, or even lead to future employment” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#deklerk2021"> [deklerk2021] </a>. Our article draws on conference organizing experience to consider how practical and organizational structures impact accessibility and diversity. Joining these two perspectives allows us to understand how knowledge production and intellectual community are rendered through conference organization.</p>
<p>A more recent paper by Ayesha I.T. Tulloch<a class="footnote-ref" href="#tulloch2020"> [tulloch2020] </a>evaluating the actions and policies of conferences held by international academic societies for ecology and conservation found that while “Conferences are important for professional learning and for building academics’ reputations and networks” the quantity and quality of initiatives to promote diversity were variable, and that there are “ethical and social justice concerns when groups are excluded from participating fully.” <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> It has been suggested that monitoring performance indicators, which will allow evaluation of gender roles and inequalities in academic conferences, could tackle the underrepresentation of women<a class="footnote-ref" href="#coronasobrino_etal2020"> [coronasobrino_etal2020] </a>.

<p>The ADHO annual conference is an ideal conference to study as an example of academic conferences. It is interdisciplinary and international in nature. It is a large-scale conference that has grown rapidly throughout the past decade. It has doubled in size, now regularly attracting more than 1000 attendees. Additionally, much of the materiality of the conference including portions of its documentation from previous conferences are available online. This paper details the results of Reflection-in-Action, Reflection-on-Action, and Action Research discussions from individuals who have all held organizational roles within the Digital Humanities annual conference. Writing as program chairs, some of this article’s authors have also served in multiple roles including Local Organizers and Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations Conference Coordinating Committee members.</p>
<p>Reflection-in-Action, and its counterpart, Reflection-on-Action, provides a methodological framework commonly used in Information Science and Human Computer Interaction to identify “features of the practice situation – complexity, uncertainty, instability, uniqueness and value conflict” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#schon1983"> [schon1983] </a>. Given the experience of the authors, a structured set of reflections upon the experience of working on the ADHO conference, and access to their contemporary notes, emails, and reports written during the conference process, were essential to the success of our task. A complementary Reflection-on-Action process, comparing and contrasting time spent volunteering when organizing past conferences, noted best (or improper) practice, and elicited the practical and theoretical knowledge gained. This helped the authors process and note both their experiences and actions, and understand and revisit underlying power structures and protocols. An Action Research recursive methodology<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stringer2013"> [stringer2013] </a>, overlapping with collaborative self-ethnography approaches<a class="footnote-ref" href="#clapp2017"> [clapp2017] </a>, allowed us to synthesize previous records of the decision making mechanisms for conference organization and the discussions that surround them (including decisions implemented via conference management software, emails, and minutes, many of which resided in author’s own personal archives). In practical terms, this was achieved through regular online meetings and discussions on structured topics over a six month period, with high levels of note-taking using shared online tools, interspersed with recursive co-creation, writing, and editing, using timed sprints and agreed deadlines, often setting aside periods of time to recover or locate dispersed information related to the conference that had never before been brought together, or that had not been institutionally archived. Other members of the community were contacted for records and to check details, where needed (although many chose to remain anonymous). A coordinated writing sprint brought together these various strands. Together, these collaborative, digitally mediated (and enabled) approaches elicited the history, analysis, and interpretation of the organization of the Digital Humanities annual conference, allowing full documentation, and presenting key findings which will be of use both to others in digital humanities, but also to others considering academic conference organization in other domains.</p>

<h2 id="background-the-history-and-organizational-framework-of-the-adho-conference">Background: The History and Organizational Framework of the ADHO Conference</h2>
<p>The international Digital Humanities conference convenes a community of digital humanities practitioners and scholars annually. The initial DH conference was held in 1989 at the University of Toronto and brought together two existing events, the 16th annual meeting of the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC, now the European Association for Digital Humanities,<a href="https://eadh.org/">EADH</a>) and the ninth annual meeting of International Conference on Computers and the Humanities (ICCH), which was sponsored with and by the<a href="https://ach.org/">Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH)</a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#adhoc"> [adhoc] </a>. Subsequent conferences included participants from additional organizations that became part of the Alliance as it exists today. This international collaboration was what led, in part, to the creation of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) in 2005<a class="footnote-ref" href="#unsworth2007"> [unsworth2007] </a>, “an umbrella organization whose goals are to promote and support digital research and teaching across arts and humanities disciplines, drawing together humanists engaged in digital and computer-assisted research, teaching, creation, dissemination, and beyond, in all areas reflected by its diverse membership” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#adhoa"> [adhoa] </a>. In 2007, the international conference took the name Digital Humanities [year], often abbreviated to DH[year] and seen on social media as #DHyyyy.</p>
<p>The annual DH conference is the result of extensive labor from a changing group of people each year, who are involved in a complex committee structure that is governed by a conference organizing protocol. As Márton Demeter points out, “conference organizers and committees” are “collective agents,”  “in the sense that they have an impact, or at least are capable of having a significant impact on other agents” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#demeter2020"> [demeter2020] </a>. The committee structure and workflows have evolved over years, in an attempt to define — from the top down — the discipline and its labor through aglobalconference. In 2020, ADHO published a new and revised conference protocol on their site that outlines some of the workflow towards the conference<a class="footnote-ref" href="#adhocp"> [adhocp] </a>. The conference organization is as follows: a group of people write a proposal to host the conference; these bids are vetted by ADHO’s Conference Coordinating Committee (CCC).<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> If selected, the people who proposed to host become the Local Organizers (LO). When the location is selected, a constituent organization of ADHO is assigned as host. That organization’s leadership proposes two Program Committee (PC) chairs who have to be approved by the Conference Coordinating Committee and ADHO governing boards; until 2017 there was a single PC chair per conference. At least one of these individuals must have served previously on a Digital Humanities conference program committee in order to be confirmed as chair.</p>
<p>The division of labor for the conference is complicated and ADHO offers copious policy documents that attempt to describe the key requirements. The Local Organizers are in charge of the budget (including sponsorship), receptions, venues, excursions, website, and other details such as ensuring accessibility, keynote translation, etc. The Program Committee handles the creation of the call for papers, selection of keynotes (with approval by the Local Organizers),<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> peer reviewing the academic program, scheduling the academic program, and publishing the selected proceedings. While this list of tasks might seem a simple division of labor, in practice, there are many gray areas, such as coordinating the publication of the book of abstracts which is separate from a proceedings volume of full essays. Many conference elements — for instance, coordinating special interest group (SIG) workshops require the Local Organizers to work closely with the program committee chairs. Cooperation, communication, and goodwill between the Local Organizers (LO) and Program Committee (PC) chairs is essential and each conference entails subtle variations in how tasks are negotiated and allocated between them.</p>
<p>Further, the conference is facilitated by thebackstagevolunteer labor of hundreds of digital humanists who lend both their digital humanities expertise and their linguistic and scholarly capacities as reviewers and attendees. Little attention is given to the volunteerism that is required to organize, facilitate, and ultimately complete a full conference cycle. Committee members, chairs, reviewers, moderators, on-site staffing, etc. are each essential to realizing the conference. Yet, there is little to no attention paid to how this unpaid labor structure is enacted, inscribes inequities, alters career trajectories, and impacts personal lives.</p>
<h2 id="step-right-up-representation-on-the-program-committee">Step Right Up: Representation on the Program Committee</h2>
<p>The program committee for the annual Digital Humanities conference is composed of representatives from each of the constituent organizations, with the goal of each organization having equal representation in the development of the academic program.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Each association brings its own organizational interests, as does each representative. Yet, the lack of standardization of organizations within ADHO creates two intertwined problems: 1) the conflation of diverse perspectives within individual associations because of the limitations on representation and 2) the lack of perspectives beyond those held by those already reflected within a constituent organization.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Tension exists between individually-held perspectives and positions and those of one’s constituent organization. Is a representative&rsquo;s responsibility to contribute their own perspectives or is it to reflect those of one’s organization? Additionally, what exactly is one’s duty on the program committee? Is it to read and review submissions? Set policies related to the academic program? Establish the conference schedule? These and many other questions arise with the installation of the program committee and its members.</p>
<p>We offer a few brief examples of how these problems play out when the current PC structure mirrors ADHO’s constituent organization structure. On the one hand, one of ADHO’s constituent organizations, the European Association of Digital Humanities (EADH) spans an entire multilingual and multicultural continent yet only has one or two representatives. This flattens the differences and competing interests among the scholars inside the association that might present unique perspectives. EADH itself is comprised of associate and partner organizations, including national societies such as the<a href="http://www.aiucd.it/">Associazione Informatica Umanistica e Cultura Digita</a>(AIUCD); one partner organization,<a href="http://dhnb.eu/">Digital Humanities in the Nordic and Baltic Countries</a>(DHNB), itself represents DH practitioners from multiple nations. EADH thus has many voices often represented as one. On the other hand, ADHO has multiple nationally-based societies as the<a href="https://csdh-schn.org/">Canadian Society for Digital Humanities/Société canadienne des humanités numériques</a>(CSDH/SCHN) and the<a href="http://tadh.org.tw/en/">Taiwanese Association for Digital Humanities</a>(TADH), which are smaller organizations with fewer members. While equal representation ensures a balance of power in decision-making, it does not allow for nuanced representation of the differing communities and interests that might diverge from the majority position within an organization. The lack of nuance, particularly of representation of those who are not represented by a constituent organization, undercuts the values articulated by ADHO.</p>
<p>Two organizations represented on the program committee are not formally based on national or continental borders:<a href="https://dhcenternet.org/">CenterNet</a>(which represents digital humanities centers) and<a href="http://www.humanisti.ca/">Humanistica</a>(which unites francophone digital humanists from around the world). Ultimately, however, both CenterNet and Humanistica are almost always represented by well-established scholars from North America or Europe. In part, this is because the barrier to participation in CenterNet is not just having a center but it is also having the local financial resources to support CenterNet membership. For newly-established centers or those whose existence are locally precarious, the likelihood that a non-Western early-career-scholar based at a digital humanities center can both be a member of CenterNet and would be selected for this service is quite low. Humanistica offers a similar challenge in that much of the association’s membership is concentrated in North America and Europe rather than French-speaking regions outside North America and Europe. As a result, representation from non-geographically-based organizations amplifies representation of interests in those geographical regions.</p>
<p>We note, furthermore, that the program committee is heavily weighted towards faculty representation from established academic institutions and with already recognized professional trajectories. Part of this may lie in the issues of workload and labor where those in precarious positions or without seniority may not be able to fully participate because of the unfunded nature of the work. This is, after all, how the academy works generally. But within digital humanities, it may also be a result of being able to situate yourself within the organization previously. Those without records of participation or active long-term investment in digital humanities leadership may struggle to gather the needed support to be appointed to the position. This tendency has implications for the program committee’s ethnic representation as well, given the dire statistics on race, gender, and the academy. For example, it wasn’t until 2018 that a woman of color occupied the co-chair position in the program committee for the first time. Importantly, though, the appointment deviated from ADHO procedures. DH2018 was the “first to be organised ‘outside’ ADHO,” noted Karina van Dalem-Oskam, chair of the Steering Committee.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> Thus Élika Ortega was appointed explicitly in a “non-voting vice chair in an advisory role,” a position created by ADHO’s Steering Committee — the first, and only such appointment. It was only later that Ortega, a junior scholar, was granted the title ofco-chairwith decision-making and voting authority equal to that of Glen Worthey, her white, male, senior colleague.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Additionally, the long duration of the appointments — generally 24 months minimum — makes participation by those occupying staff and non-faculty positions particularly challenging. When committee members are not appointed by the beginning of the two-year term, it impacts the functionality of the program committee. As Manfred Thaller notes in his official report, DH2016 struggled with the constituent organizations’ late-appointments of program committee members less than a year prior to the conference which meant there wasn’t sufficient time to determine collective conference priorities for the program.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> The adoption of at-large positions is one potential way forward that might address issues of rank, diversity, and representation beyond the academy by allowing anyone within the digital humanities community the opportunity to serve. But so too would addressing the need for compensation for the work of the program committee. Solving structural imbalances in the composition of the program committee goes beyond the conference program committee and its chairs, but needs to be acknowledged in the conference’s decision making processes.</p>
<h2 id="the-greatest-show-of-all-setting-the-tone-with-conference-themes">The Greatest Show of All: Setting the Tone with Conference Themes</h2>
<p>Although conference themes might not initially seem as important as logistical factors of venue, budget, and local resources that are taken into consideration as much when teams bid to host the conference, we believe them to be crucial as guiding principles in decision making processes. For example, the theme of the 2018 conference, “Bridges/Puentes,” strongly influenced the crafting of the call for papers (CfP) and the inclusion of topics such as the collaborative relationships between scholars from the Global North and the Global South; different practices and epistemologies across geopolitical realities, and others. Similarly, this theme guided the gathering of presentations over the basis of a shared topic, approach, or methodology rather than by language as it was historically done. This yielded, for example, a session in art history with presentations in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, instead of, for instance, a session in Spanish on a multitude of topics. In addition to being hosted in a large French-speaking city, DH2017’s theme “Access/Accès” also signaled the bilingualism of the conference which included not only a French language keynote, but also sessions where all the presentations were in French. Likewise, DH2020’s theme “Carrefours/Intersections” signaled the conference’s commitment to emphasizing and supporting French-language digital humanities scholarship, reflecting “the geographical and cultural heritage of Ottawa, a bilingual city in unceded Algonquin territory” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dh2020cd"> [dh2020cd] </a>.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Conference themes, by virtue of being one of the first choices made about a conference, are one way that the conference signals its priorities.</p>
<p>While much of the content of the CfP is mandated by policy, the conference theme is handled separately. At the time of bidding for the conference, the local organizers select a theme that resonates either locally with their digital humanities community or that they feel best serves the interest of the digital humanities communities at large. That theme is shared with the executive committee of ADHO and can be subtly shifted based on their feedback. As a result, the theme is often prescribed for the Program Committee prior to its creation. This can cause tension within the Program Committee as the theme should guide the academic program; yet the representatives appointed to the Program Committee have no authority to change or revise the theme. In the best scenario, the local organizers consult with the Program Committee after their appointment on explanations and definitions of the theme that will be incorporated into the call for papers. At the end of the 2018 conference, DH2019 announced the main theme of “Complexities” which “suits the very diverse situation in Europe and DH at large, and captures the challenge to develop across regions and represent more inclusive, global perspectives on scholarship and teaching” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dh2019cfpe"> [dh2019cfpe] </a>. Local organizers then launched a parallel theme of “Focus on Africa” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dh2019foa"> [dh2019foa] </a>that was intended to build on their existing collaborations with African scholars. While they noted that this was an effort to “help open up the conference to scholars from an area that is still very much underrepresented in the DH community,” concerns quickly arose around cost of attendance, that scholarships would only partly cover costs of travel and attendance, and that participants in the Africa workshop were somehow outside the main conference process. It did not help that the announcement was “clumsy” as program chairs noted. It also was problematic that the workshop was discussed as a “satellite” event rather than part of the conference proper and began a full week prior to the conference workshops (thereby increasing housing and meal costs for attendees who hoped to attend both). One digital humanist noted their skepticism on “how a ‘Focus on Africa’ will really empower underrepresented communities” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#krautli2019"> [krautli2019] </a>. Another attendee noted via twitter that there were “few perspectives from Africa on Africa” at the conference<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kandeh2019"> [kandeh2019] </a>. The carving-off of a portion of conference events to a separate event is not unique to 2019. Indeed, there is a track record of portions of the conference program being isolated from the main conference including being held in separate buildings by themselves (2016’s panel on inclusion and accessibility, for instance).</p>
<p>For DH2020, the local organizing committee and the program committee chairs co-drafted a document explaining the theme which was then discussed, modified, and endorsed by both full committees. The collaborative work on the theme helped ensure that no committee saw it as an imposition. Given the broad range of digital humanities topics and interests, the theme is a way to narrow the selection of possible keynote presenters as well as to signal to potential presenters topics that they might engage with. Most themes incorporate a set of sub-themes or topics. This can take the form of bullet-pointed lists or, as 2020 did, a set of values statements around selected sub-disciplines: of digital first nations and indigenous studies; public digital humanities; and open data. Rather than articulate all of these details in the main CfP, DH2020 elected to publish a conference themes document on the conference website that provided an explanation of each sub-discipline and its relationship to the topic of “Carrefours” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dh2020cd"> [dh2020cd] </a>. The program committee chose the sub-disciplinary interests and outlined capacious definitions so potential presenters could position their ongoing work within the theme. For DH2020, the program committee had planned to go forward with three themed special journal issues that would reflect each of the areas outlined, however, because of COVID-19, the Ottawa conference did not take place; as such, neither did the special issues that would have emerged from that gathering.</p>
<p>As the most recognized annual international conference in digital humanities, the DH conference also welcomes presentations on ongoing research regardless of its connection to the conference’s theme. This manifests a tension between submissions that adhere to the conference theme and those that do not. It is the determination of the program committee what value, if any, to assign submissions that align to the theme. For DH2020, the program committee, in consultation with the local organizers, conference coordinating committee, and executive board, chose to weight the theme as ten percent of the consideration for peer reviewing applications. The Program Committee wished to directly acknowledge the three sub-disciplinary areas as vital to the intellectual breadth and depth of the conference. Part of the rationale for this was the local appeal to scholars working on these topics; chairs also wanted the digital humanities community to consider these sub-disciplines as a coherent set of interests. The decision to weightthemeat ten percent was ultimately frustrating for both the Program Committee and the submitters. A handful of individuals pushed back against measuring submissions in relation to theme, preferring a nominal theme that is not actually considered in relation to submissions. In some cases, the discontent stemmed from long-standing digital humanists not seeing their research interests reflected in the three sub-disciplines chosen for that year’s conference; others noted that past practice had not evaluated submissions in relation to conference themes. This concern was expressed in direct emails from participants and peer reviewers as well as in peer reviewers’ uneven deployment of the categoryrelation to themefrom the peer review rubric. Uneven evaluative actions were not reserved for thematic weighting alone; previous Program Committees have expressed similar sentiments about evaluation in other categories. The rubric (including the criteria on which submissions were evaluated and their weight) was circulated in advance so that everyone submitting could tailor their applications accordingly. Yet, attempts to align submission abstracts to review criteria varied widely.</p>
<p>In the future, the Conference Coordinating Committee, Local Organizers, and Program Committee will need to decide on the value and purpose of having a themed conference, or perhaps decide to jettison the notion of themes altogether. While the first would make it easier for submitters and the program committee to complete their work, the lack of a theme may guide the conference away from coherence. For scholars invested in emerging fields that are reflected in the sub-themes, the loss of the opportunity for the larger digital humanities community to consider their importance can be quite damaging. Ultimately, conference themes such as DH2011’s “Big Tent Digital Humanities,” can spawn debate, affect public discourse beyond the conference itself, and may have long lasting reverberations.</p>
<p>We recommend that program committee chairs (perhaps in concert with the conference coordinating committee and the local organizing committee) establish and publish their conference’s guiding principles, which can then be incorporated into the theme and CfP. We further recommend that program committee chairs publicly share the conference’s anticipated and actual outcomes based on the established theme. Ultimately, we view conference themes as an opening through which ADHO and annual organizers can reach out to scholars and scholarship that may have been overlooked or outright ignored.</p>

<p>A vital part of conference planning is the solicitation of participation to potential attendees, both those who are existing members of the association and those who might join in order to participate in the conference. Generally, membership enrollment spikes for organizations who are supporting the conference occuring in their geographical locale. The CfP serves as the first element of outreach to participants. It guides potential attendees in understanding both the mechanics of the conference (dates, submission formats, etc.) as well as the placement of the conference within the ecosystem of disciplinary conventions. These practices are not just ethical questions related to submitting one’s own original work and participating in single-anonymous, double-anonymous, or open peer review;<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> they are also statements that communicate values around diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. Does the conference welcome submissions in multiple languages, or formats? Does the call include statements related to codes of conduct and guidance on the accessibility of presentation materials? And, as importantly, does the call for papers clearly articulate how submission decisions will be reached? Do submissions need to comply with criteria such as racial, gender, representation, or status balance on panels or forums? Does it welcome submissions by those outside academic ranks? Each of these questions serves to broaden or limit the potential pool of participants.</p>
<p>At the annual international digital humanities conference, the call for papers process is prescribed and supervised by ADHO’s Conference Coordinating Committee (CCC). The CCC provides to every program committee a template that outlines not just what content should be included in the CfP but also the placement of elements within the CfP in relation to one another. It is guided by theConference Protocolswhich were created in order to standardize conference procedures from year to year and also to help organizers, who come to the position new each year. The conference is organized on a rolling basis. As such, at any given time, there are three conference planning groups running: the current conference process, the past conference teams as they close out their activities such as publishing proceedings, and future conference groups who are learning about the activities they will need to participate in. While there is overlap in representation from the same organizations, very rarely is there overlap with the individual members assigned. As such, conference protocols are designed to reduce potential errors or issues, both known and unknown, for organizers, committee members, and participants as they move through one of the three stages. Manfred Thaller noted that “the relationship between [the program committee and the conference coordinating committee] has been rather vaguely defined” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#thaller2016"> [thaller2016] </a>, particularly in relation to when the PC needs to seek approval from the CCC. He further highlights the inconsistency of involvement of the chair of the conference coordinating committee in supervising program committee work. In 2019, Diane Jakacki and Brian Croxall, chairs of the Conference Coordinating Committee, undertook the task of rewriting the conference protocols: the new protocols were to be applied to the 2021 conference (which, due to COVID-19, has been pushed back a year); yet, even with ongoing revisions to the protocols, the ongoing debate over the relationship between the conference coordinating committee, the local organizing committee, and the program committee continues. The kinds of questions covered by the conference protocols include: What types of presentations will the conference have? Is there a conference theme or set of topics that will guide conference interests? How will submissions be reviewed? By whom will the program ultimately be decided? While these may seem simple mechanistic questions that are formulaic, the reality is that each of these questions is situated within a set of conventions that implicitly and explicitly communicate disciplinary standards and value-systems. Every member who participates in the process brings with them their own disciplinary and personal predispositions to organizing the conference.</p>
<p>Any changes to the template, be it language of publication, variation to submission deadline dates, the introduction of new formats or criteria for submission, or the excision of elements from the template, have to be reviewed and approved by the CCC who generally consult with the Executive officers. The ADHO CfP is created each year by the program committee, whose chairs and members change for every conference. Each program committee draws on previous years’ CfPs: as you can see from the appended calls from 2015-2020, some sections were retained over the years. This was a purposeful policy on ADHO’s part in order to minimize the labor of translating the call into multiple languages; however, it also constrained program committees from innovation, acknowledging the rapid changes in the field, or even addressing existing challenges. So, for example in 2015, the program committee was expressly forbidden from varying the CfP in their content or structure. Translation of new material would be too costly and time-consuming; this despite the fact that ADHO does not fund translation activities and that program chairs often must use their own personal resources to fund translation. Coupled with this, in 2015, even without variation to the CfP, there were no translators available for some languages. Translation may also be limited at the request of local organizers. In 2019, local organizers declined to have the call for papers translated into Dutch claiming that “most of the academic communication in the Netherlands happens in English” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ciotti_etal2019"> [ciotti_etal2019] </a>. While this was likely correct, the question of whether the lack of translation to Dutch limited potential contributions from those outside the English-speaking academic community remained unanswered.</p>
<h2 id="three-ring-circuspeerreviewand-peer-review">Three Ring Circus?:Peer,Review,and Peer Review</h2>
<p>It may not be immediately obvious, but important opportunities to enact any kind of changes to the conference program, including adherence to the theme, linguistic, regional, and disciplinary diversity, rely on the peer review process.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> Peer review offers potential that is matched with unexpected risks for failure. Conference protocols, developed by ADHO’s Conference Coordinating Committee and used for planning the event, dictates that program committees are unable to implement changes in the peer review process without approval. This has included in previous iterations of the protocols limiting the expansion of the reviewer pool to a biannual process despite need for new reviewers, as well as mandating a process ofreview biddingthat was implemented to encourage participation by reviewers, but may have had unintended negative consequences, such as favoritism. For example, most of the procedural changes implemented for DH2018 in Mexico City (e.g., expanding the reviewer pool during anoff-cycleyear; abandoning the review bidding phase; and moving to double-anonymous peer review) were motivated specifically by the desire to make space for scholars from Latin America in the program. The existing approved review pool had limited Spanish-speaking reviewers so an expansion of the pool was clearly in order; Latin American scholars who had previously submitted to the conference had received hostile or uncollegial reviews. Moving to an expanded pool of reviewers and the double-anonymous review process was intended to alleviate those issues.</p>
<p>Complicating all peer review processes for the DH conferences is the use of the<a href="https://www.conftool.net/">ConfTool</a>management system, which utilizes both a manual and automatic review assignment process<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conftool"> [conftool] </a>. ConfTool is a commercial service that ADHO licenses each year. Every year, the previous year’s ConfTool database is imported into a new ConfTool instance, a functionality that has advantages for organizers and participants. Past participants don’t need to create a new login account or state their review expertise topics; organizers have a ready-made mailing list and review information already available to the program committee. Carrying over this database, however, also reiterates outdated user information (such as the use of deadnames, that is, original birth names after an individual has altered their name) as well as biases (listing some subfields and not others) that may have been incorporated in previous conference processes. For example, there may be missing expertise fields, scholars may not update their expertise to align to new areas of work, or there may be reviewers who remain within the reviewer pool despite issues around code of conduct. Noting below how ConfTool shapes the organization and the DH conference, we are also aware that every conference management tool will have its own issues. However, there has been no systematic evaluation of how ConfTool structures affect decision-making, organization, labor issues, and other crucial conference functions.</p>
<p>In ConfTool, once all submissions have been received with keywords selected and all reviewers have been marked with reviewer status, the automatic assignment system identifies conflicts of interests between submissions and potential reviewers. When conflicts have been identified, the algorithm tries to find “the best reviewers for each paper (so not the best papers for each reviewer)” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#conftool"> [conftool] </a>. In some years, this includes considering reviewer preferences (known as thebidding process) for particular review assignments. Most years, though, the algorithm moves directly to “matching topics according to the areas of expertise” (counting down from the highest number of matches to one, e.g., five, four, three, two, one matches between areas of expertise and topics selected by the authors). Finally, the algorithm attempts to assign to those with the fewest number of reviews assigned to a given reviewer. While this sounds logical, the algorithm is limited in three key ways. First, the algorithm does not accommodate submissions and reviewer expertise outside of the English language. Thus, you cannot assign Spanish-language submissions, for example, only to reviewers who are fluent in Spanish. Instead, you must manually match those with multilingual expertise to those submissions that are in that language adding significant labor to the work of program chairs. Second, complicating manual assignment is that ConfTool has no specific mechanism for differentiating the language of presentation from the content of the submission. As a result, program chairs have to incorporate language proficiency in the default user profiles and then manually match that information to the topical fields related to language. Because many authors either fail to mark the language of presentation, assume that the system will automatically identify multilingual submissions, or confuse the topic of research (on Mexico, for example) with the desire to submit and present in Spanish, program chairs either must review all submissions to ensure the correct languages are selected or, as most program chairs have done, manually assign all non-English submissions first outside the algorithmic assignment process. While in some languages there may only be a handful of submissions, depending on the year and location the number of non-English submissions can be quite large. This leads to the third problem which is that there is no way to weight or sequence the algorithm processing of topical keywords. Program chairs cannot prioritize matching linguistic proficiencies first before topics such as discipline or geography. As a result, the algorithm may identify a high match of four or five topics and none of them relate to linguistic ability resulting in a reviewer being unable to review a submission. While individually these issues can be resolved through creative solutions and human engineering, the underlying issue of the algorithm illustrates an English bias that undermines diversity efforts. Given the international nature of the conference, the inability of the ConfTool system to accommodate multilingualism and complexity in reviewer assignment and submission information is quite problematic. As Elena Pierazzo and Fabio Ciotti noted in their 2019 chairs report, “no automatic system will solve all the problems, nor an absolute and mechanic reliance on external peer review is acceptable in all cases” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ciotti_etal2019"> [ciotti_etal2019] </a>.</p>
<p>The manual assignment of reviewers and the expansion of the multilingual reviewer pool are invisible to most but are key for the success of the review process. These two efforts can have positive repercussions in the acceptance of proposals that under different review bodies with particular merit standards might not be ranked positively, in the overall composition of the program, and ultimately in the overall proceedings of the conference. Difficulties to enact changes such as these include making proposals to the CCC that justify a deviation from the protocols and usages at the time. That is in addition to the work of reaching out to reviewers, vetting them, and maintaining good communication. These are challenges for every conference but are especially pressing for conferences being hosted for the first time by a member association. DH2018, the first to take place in the Global South, was especially burdened as missteps in the conference process would impact both future hosting abilities as well as the potential growth of local membership.</p>
<p>For many years, the standard modality of peer review for the international DH conference was single-anonymous: anonymous reviewers were able to see the names of proposal authors. This practice not only was fairly non-standard in academia, but also entailed a lack of balance and equity between reviewers and submission authors<a class="footnote-ref" href="#okike_etal2016"> [okike_etal2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#tompkins_etal2017"> [tompkins_etal2017] </a>. Although at various times, single-anonymous reviewing was questioned in the ADHO community, there was considerable resistance (and perhaps marginal or marginalized motivation) to change it. Because participants in the conference come from varied institutional, geographic, and disciplinary backgrounds, however, many people bring different expectations for peer review to the conference itself.</p>
<p>Changes to the single-anonymous model have been used to try to mitigate these concerns, which were widely, if too often quietly, acknowledged by conference organizers, delegates, and other practitioners. Uncollegial and outright rude review tone, implicit bias, and inappropriate deference tostardomwere known problems for years. In DH2018, for example, the shift to double-anonymous peer review helped prevent both the implicit negative biases that might arise from a reviewer reacting to a linguistically or culturally coded author’s name or from an institutional affiliation. It also addressed an unconscious (or perhaps conscious) positive bias in response to seeing a very well-known author. Some of these biases were further exacerbated by thereview biddingphase where potential reviewers had the chance to choose what and whose work to evaluate (this practice between 2013 and 2017 has been abandoned). The problem of uncollegial tone in reviews was sadly not resolved by the double-anonymous approach for 2018. However, double-anonymous peer review did have an impact in closing the scoring gaps between well-known scholars and newcomers to the conference for both DH2018 and DH2019. Fabio Ciotti and Elena Pierazzo noted that double anonymous “seems to lower the authority bias and help younger and less known scholars to get good scores.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ciotti_etal2019"> [ciotti_etal2019] </a>DH2019 did, however, experience issues around the anonymity of submissions. Some authors failed to properly anonymize their contributions while others were overly-anonymized by limiting access to websites and other supporting citations that might strengthen their contributions<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ciotti_etal2019"> [ciotti_etal2019] </a>. DH2020 enacted open peer review where both the reviewer and submitter names were known to each other and to the program committee (but reviews were not publicly posted). DH2020’s open peer review was met with both criticism and praise. Some participants in the digital humanities conference are committed to only undertaking open peer review, whereas others can be skeptical of its scholarly rigor. Future program committees will need to judiciously choose their peer review modality (open, single-anonymous, or double-anonymous); and, regardless of the style of peer reviewing selected, will need to work to ensure that the review process does not simply reinforce existing biases and axes of privilege that cut across the conference and community.</p>
<p>The selection process and the making of the program is the stage of the conference where the Program Committee exerts the most power and situates a year’s conference in regards to the field. Although the selection process might seem to be a mechanical one where acutoff pointin scoring separates accepted proposals from those not accepted, in reality, this exercise involves a large degree of give and take. There are a variety of factors that must necessarily guide the process including the number of submissions in various presentation categories (poster, panel, long or short paper, etc.); physical limitations of the venue; temporal limitations of the conference calendar; diversity of participants (discipline and approach; career stage; geographical, linguistic, and cultural background). The merit and quality of a proposal may be perceived to be the deciding factors, as though the selection process was a competition and acceptance to the conference was the prize, one that could signal membership to the digital humanities community and room in theBig Tent.Complicating the question of acceptance is the rapidly increasing scale of the conference which has seen exponential growth in both the number of submissions and the number of individuals involved in the conference process through reviewing. DH2015, for example, as the table below outlines, saw 426 submissions with 371 approved reviewers. DH2019, just four years later, saw 893 submissions with an active reviewer pool of 661 individuals.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup><br>

A rejection notification is sometimes met with push-back, privately and/or publicly, arguing for the quality of a proposal, the precedent of having been accepted in previous years, or, from another stance, the gatekeeping of the field and the lack of diversity. As has been proven, merit in the academy is not an equitable measurement of success or rewards, but rather a skewed one where resources are allocated to those who already have them. Thus, an assumption of the fairness of rewarding merit can only lead to a feedback loop where success is granted only (or mostly) to those who are already successful<a class="footnote-ref" href="#weingart2016"> [weingart2016] </a>. Should merit then be centered as the deciding factor of acceptance? We contend that it shouldn’t. Instead, program committees should prioritize a deliberate curatorial approach: a local language, under-recognized academic approaches, justice and equity, etc. Conference themes (discussed above) might assist in that effort; however, without thematic alignment being represented in the review criteria, thematic efforts might be ignored. A look at the history of the conference offers examples of both.</p>
<p>In 2018, for example, the program co-chairs centered the location of the conference, which afforded many digital humanists in Latin America the possibility of attending due to proximity, fewer (or no) visa requirements, and lower costs, in their curation of the program. Rather than relying on the metrics of merit (scoring) alone, the program chairs focused on ensuring that the percentage of presentations accepted from practitioners based in Latin America roughly matched the percentage of submissions initially received from the region. This labor was strongly facilitated by the work already done by the reviewers who not only had various linguistic and disciplinary backgrounds, but also, crucially, came from varied academic cultures so that a single notion of merit, quality, or value did not dominate. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the single notion that dominated prior efforts in addressing inequity in review was the centering of tenure-track and tenured faculty who sought to uphold the privilege of degree, access to publication venues, and the reification of citational privilege. As the 2018 chairs learned from this example, evaluation must not only deal with linguistic competency, but must also consider cultural, contextual, and citational practices fairly. We suggest that there is no innate, universal knowledge that all scholars should have; rather, we are suggesting that the notion of what is appropriate academic practice varies greatly and can be weaponized against those who are not engaged with North American and European digital humanities as led by the tenured and those on the tenure track.<br>

Although protocols outline that the program committee determines conference acceptance, in practicality members of the ADHO Executive have had significant interest in acceptance rates. For instance, in 2020, ADHO provided suggested baseline thresholds for acceptance and rejection without examining the submissions or their reviews; in 2015, there was significant tension around acceptance rates given the venue location (Sydney, Australia). Further, there is a disconnect between the desire by ADHO to maintain a stance of exclusivity in relationship to acceptance and rejection rates and the inverse desire for the conference to serve as a gathering opportunity for the entirety of the field that generates revenue. There are significant financial implications to exclusivity as it limits the potential income of the conference. As conference income is dispersed among the member organizations, choices to cap the number of presenters also limit the amount of disbursements to organizations in the year following. This can then directly impact the constituent organizations and their activities.</p>
<p>A centering of what might seem priorities alternative to merit for the selection and crafting of the program has important ramifications for the scholarly dialogue not just across disciplines, methodologies, but also academic cultures. All conferences are exclusionary in some way. But awareness of that exclusion needs to be not only attended to but also openly addressed where possible. Successive Digital Humanities conferences have consistently attempted to just add more concurrent sessions as if that would address issues of exclusion and merit; yet, in our experience and analysis, additional sessions do not necessarily translate into a more diverse conference program, rather it provides more opportunities to those already centered within the field. Ultimately, centering specific disciplines, themes, or locales can offer new points of departure for our initial questions, what is the conference supposed to <em>do</em> , and what is it <em>for</em> ?</p>
<h2 id="just-the-tonic-keynote-speakers-at-the-adho-conference">Just the Tonic?: Keynote Speakers at the ADHO Conference</h2>
<p>The wordkeynoteis derived from the practice of playing a note at the outset of a musical performance in order to establish the key<a class="footnote-ref" href="#oed2021a"> [oed2021a] </a>. Typically, this would be the lowest note (the tonic) of the musical scale. From the early 1900s, the noun has been used as a verb to describe presentations which set the prevailing tone or essential ideas of a meeting<a class="footnote-ref" href="#oed2021b"> [oed2021b] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kelly2016"> [kelly2016] </a>. Built into the very idea of the keyote then, is a sense of establishing or leading the development of harmonious relationships, of providing the conditions for collaborative expression at scale.</p>
<p>Academic conferences carry this meaning into the organization of keynotes or plenary speakers. A keynote speaker is expected to represent leadership in a given field, signaling both evident accomplishment and simultaneously pointing to the directions that the discipline (and more specifically the conference) might follow. Keynotes are a matter-of-course event within the format of many intellectual meetings. Yet there have been few analyses undertaken of either the selection or content of keynote speeches, and how they both signify and enact prestige, power, hierarchy, and direction of travel for the discipline.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> In complex, manifold fields such as the Digital Humanities there is a tradition of inviting two to three (and in some years up to five) keynote speakers to cover developments in the many distinct strands of research undertaken by the scholarly community. Typically, a keynote address is delivered by a soloist and there is no competing program event to distract conference attendees. The presenter is expected to speak authoritatively on their area of expertise for forty to forty-five minutes with a short opportunity for questions from the floor.</p>
<p>The selection of ADHO keynote speakers is one of the first and one of the trickiest tasks of the conference programming committee after CfP creation for a number of reasons. In order to attract keynote speakers the conference covers travel, accommodation and registration fees. As there is no guarantee that the speaker(s) desired most by the Program Committee will agree, the complex logistics of these arrangements require invitations to be sent early. The announcement of keynote speakers is crucial in promoting the conference and attracting attendees — the earlier they are confirmed the higher the potential impact on the budget that pays their way by encouraging registration of potential attendees. The proposed keynotes are then required to satisfy both the expectations of the programming committee (to be of sufficient academic standing in relation to the conference themes and lines of enquiry) and the local organizers (to be sufficiently recognizable to market the conference and generate registrations). This can give rise to delicate, and not always harmonious, negotiations between the Chair(s) of the Programming Committee and the Local Organizer(s). The intensity of these negotiations are directly proportional to the stakes for the organizers which extend beyond the terms of the conference itself. For example, there are implicit career and professional network benefits to conference organizers in a position to offer keynotes to more senior and influential figures in the field. Often organizers garner individual or small group type activities with speakers that can foster collaboration or reciprocal invitations. There can also be a sense of obligation to invite specific individuals based at the university hosting the conference or located in the country in which it takes place. Not inviting a leading figure at one’s university or national network can have professional consequences. There are also professional opportunities for invited keynotes that they might otherwise not have. These types of presentations for tenure, or promotion, are taken as an indicator of value and prestige within the academic system. Often, speakers will then be invited to give additional talks at other conferences and institutions by those in attendance as a result of having seen them speak.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> There is, then, a significant amount of power in both the choosing of academic speakers and also for those who accept to speak: the allocation of this power dynamic has hitherto been underexplored in digital humanities.</p>
<p>The strenuous contestation over keynote selection is not surprising given the symbolic weight of the keynote as an exemplar of how the digital humanities, and academia more broadly framed, is seen to definemeritin a value judgment that has real-life implications for the CVs and career progressions of those offered keynote slots and the networks and reputational affordances for those that select them. This extends to the awarding of annual prizes at the Digital Humanities conference as well. These power issues often have a gendered aspect.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> For example, the 2013 conference in Nebraska was sharply rebuked by attendees when almost all the awards and keynote addresses were offered to those identifying publicly as men. It has been noted that although, in binary terms, there is near gender parity across attendees of Digital Humanities conferences, there is a far higher concentration of men presenting standard papers<a class="footnote-ref" href="#eichmannkalwara_etal2018"> [eichmannkalwara_etal2018] </a>. But, given that the conference is made up of parallel sessions, each conference participant can only attend a select number of these and it is impossible to personally experience the power disparity at full scale. Keynote and plenaries are a different matter since there are no competing events and all conference attendees can be in the room for the one session. On the first day of proceedings at the 2015 conference, in which only men were seen on stage (nine of them, one after another), a vigorous backchannel twitter discussion arose in response to what was described as the “parade of the patriarchs” (<a href="#figure01">See Figure 1</a>).</p>

<p>We used aContent Analysis recursive methodology<a class="footnote-ref" href="#krippendorff2018"> [krippendorff2018] </a>to look at gender distribution in the keynotes of Digital Humanities conferences. For 31 years of ADHO conferences (1990-2020 inclusive) we analyzed the gender of invited keynote speakers (assessed by pronouns used by the speakers themselves in the published record). To the best of our knowledge there were no explicit non-binary keynote speakers, an omission which itself demands reflection and redress. There were 73 keynote speaker slots (counting repeating individuals andduetsin which two speakers filled a slot): these went to men 51 times, and women 22 times. There were 67 unique speakers (47 men, and 20 women). 5 individuals had been asked to deliver a keynote multiple times: Burrows (3), Drucker (2), Queman (2), Aguera (2) and McCarty (2). There were 12 conferences with men-only keynotes: 3 conferences with women-only keynotes, and 7 conferences where there were equal numbers of keynotes. If we were to aim to achieve parity, assuming that there will be only two unique keynote speaker slots at future conferences, we would need to program women-only keynotes for the next 15 years of conferences, until 2035. This deficit persists despite the fact that gender disparities in keynote addresses have improved in more recent times: in the first 8 years of conferences in our data only men gave keynotes. Since 2012 there has been at least one woman keynote speaker at each of the conferences. In some instances, this opportunity has been created by expanding the number of keynotes presented rather than not including men speakers. In other words, there haven&rsquo;t been fewer men. The last all-men keynote line-up was 2011 which had four men keynote speakers (including a closing keynote presented jointly by two men). But, as noted, the pace of change is not enough to deliver on the promise of parity for some time to come.</p>
<p>The homophily of keynote invitations is further underscored in an analysis of the institutional affiliations of speakers. Of the 73 keynote speaking roles — with some keynote sessions involving two speakers — 72 reported an institutional (almost always academic) affiliation. Over a third (25) worked for European institutions and it should be noted that 50% (36) were located at universities and research institutes in the USA and Canada. The entire, vast and various, rest of the world (ROW) contributed only 11 speakers. Many of these 11 were programmed in the most recent three conferences. To put that a different way: in the first 22 years of the conference (1990-2011) there were only two keynote presentations in which the speaker was affiliated with an institution outside Europe and North America — and both those presentations were given by the same man (John Burrows from the University of Newcastle in Australia). Four years later, in 2015, the conference was finally located, for the first time, outside either Europe or USA/Canada in Sydney (Australia). By this time (including the 2015 Sydney conference) the accumulated ROW keynotes numbered seven, three of which had been delivered by the one man, again — John Burrows. Men are uniformly overrepresented as a proportion of speakers in this geo-locational analysis — the same percentage (72%) of the speaking roles in the Europe/UK and USA/Canada cohorts respectively were filled by men. As a proportion of the ROW women make up 36% of the total speaker slots which expands to 44% if we adjust forBurrowing,i.e. the effect of repeated keynote appearances by John Burrows. Based on an analysis of the aggregate numbers alone, if you want to secure selection as a keynote presenter at an ADHO conference, it would help to be a white man, ideally based at a North American institution and preferably named John (or a variation thereof).</p>
<p>The practice of equity and diversity is something to be publicly enacted, modeled, and celebrated: to be putcenter stage(both literally and figuratively). Some conference organizers but to our mind, not nearly enough have worked consciously to ensure that people from historically under-represented groups occupied prominent positions at the conference, including the delivery of keynotes. Most often, and despite the best efforts of these individual conference chairs, the program has not delivered on rudimentary equity and diversity baselines, notably in terms of keynote speakers. We must ask the community: why?</p>
<p>In part, the selection of keynotes often relies on issues of academic prestige and rank. Senior scholars who are overwhelmingly male and white within digital humanities contexts have, as we’ve demonstrated, been rewarded with keynote opportunities. There is a general reluctance for keynotes to be assigned to those who aren’t well-known within national or global digital humanities. This then reproduces their notoriety. Problematizing the selection of keynotes is the requirement that local organizers have input on keynote selection. This can manifest in conflicts over whether a potential speaker will be appealing enough to encourage people to register for the conference. It can also manifest in local organizers strongly desiring a given speaker to recognize someone from their own national contexts. Neither program committees nor local organizers are without blame in this dynamic; the conflict between them is baked in through the conference protocols where the local organizers budget for the keynote which leads them to further want input into the selection. While the keynote is technically part of the academic program, thesale-abilityof the person is of utmost concern as there is a perception that the keynote might attract participants who otherwise might not attend.</p>
<p>Equity is both an outcome <em>and</em> a process. Without greater transparency and accountability, justice for underrepresented communities will not be delivered by the ADHO conference. It is not without some small measure of irony that a Digital Humanities conference system is unable to apply even a small number of data-driven approaches to implementing open decision making and transparent answerability to the digital humanities community. In addition to the regional and linguistic profile of speakers, we support an intentional effort to bring to the forefront practices that are not necessarily in the current core of the field. To our minds, some of the most memorable keynote speeches have shared an interest in presenting <em>other</em> ways of seeing, understanding, and computing the world. They have also had in common an emphasis on how digital technologies can be used for ethnic, cultural, epistemological, and sometimes physical survival. We therefore suggest that it should be a prerequisite in conference organization protocols to pledge to have a multiplicity of genders across keynote invitations, with weighting towards non-male members of academic staff, to give them access to the prestige mechanisms which exist within our scholarly societies, that will go on to impact their careers.</p>
<h2 id="cirque-magique-multilingualism">Cirque Magique: Multilingualism</h2>
<p>Historically, English has been the default working language of The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations and, therefore, of the conference and of the program committee. As Quinn Dombrowski and Patrick Burns note, the field of digital humanities itself has an “English problem” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dombrowski_etal2022"> [dombrowski_etal2022] </a>.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Acknowledging the hegemony of English and the academic cultures it represents, ADHO has for a long time had a stated purpose of fostering and increasing the representation of ethnic, racial, linguistic, gender, and national digital humanists. The creation of the Committee on Multi-Lingualism &amp; Multi-Culturalism committee (MLMC) in 2005 is evidence of this aspiration<a class="footnote-ref" href="#adhomlmcc"> [adhomlmcc] </a>. For ADHO’s annual DH conference, in particular, the Conference Code of Conduct directs us to “work actively toward the creation of a more diverse, welcoming, and inclusive global community of digital humanities scholars and practitioners” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#adhoccoc"> [adhoccoc] </a>. The creation of MLMC and a lack of other bodies tasked with overseeing equity in terms of gender, ability, career stage, etc. signals how linguistic diversity and multiculturalism have been used as shorthand forgeneraldiversity. At its best, if actually coupled with multiculturalism, linguistic diversity could serve as a proxy for regional and epistemological diversity, but there has already been a struggle to enact that alignment.</p>
<p>For one, the centrality of these principles and the concrete ways they are applied has rested with the conference organizing and program committees, which change personnel and priorities on a yearly basis. Moreover, MLMC has ex officio representation on these committees but has no budget and no direct responsibility or authority for the actions of the committee — or of ADHO in general. Indeed, the responsibilities of the MLMC for the conference have been narrowly focused on coordinating the translation of the CfP from English to ADHO’s other four official languages: French, Spanish, German, and Italian. Translations into other languages – Polish in Krakow 2016<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dh2016"> [dh2016] </a>, Portuguese in 2018<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dh2018"> [dh2018] </a>, and Anishinàbemiwin/Algonquin in Ottawa 2020<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dh2020a"> [dh2020a] </a>– have often fallen onto program committee chairs or local organizers to do themselves or to obtain funding to pay for translation services. The contradictory aspiration of diversity through multilingualism, the lack of influence from MLMC, and the annually diverging approaches of conference organizers have resulted not just on radically uneven results from one year to another but, worse, on disappointing measures.</p>
<p>Despite procedures that could be expected to make a difference, as happened in DH2014 when the Call for Papers was published in twenty-three languages, multilingual participation was extremely low. As Martin Grandjean wrote in his report on the result of that appeal, submissions to the conference were in only six languages other than English, resulting in just 4.1% of all presentations being delivered in French, Spanish, Italian, or German<a class="footnote-ref" href="#grandjean2014"> [grandjean2014] </a>. In this scenario, the aspirations for a multilingual conference failed to materialize, and also added additional overhead to the peer review process, including identifying and gathering enough reviews in minority languages. While those less knowledgeable might assume that the lack of participation was a result of an absence of digital humanities activities, or worse a deficiency in quality, in areas working in those languages, the reality is that the lack of submissions has likely been a result of systemic obstacles to multi-lingual participation. This includes the patent inadequacy of multilingual affordances in the conference management tool, the lack of resources allocated to translation efforts, the scarcity of identified peer reviewers willing or able to evaluate non-English abstracts, and a lack of outreach to multilingual communities who engage in digital humanities practices but do not strictly define themselves as digital humanists.</p>
<p>More unfortunate, however, has been a lack of tolerance for presentations not in English from conference delegates. Accounts of conference rooms being partially vacated when presentations were offered in Spanish, French, German, or Italian have not been rare. This has occurred despite the origination and support for the DH Whispers campaign, implemented in 2014 by Alex Gil and Élika Ortega. Attendees who were willing to help out translating to or from any language being used at the conference were able to wear a pin that demarcated their willingness to translate in support of presenters and audience members<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ortega2014"> [ortega2014] </a>. That work was incorporated into the Global Outlook: Digital Humanities’ Translation Toolkit, a set of recommendations for translation at conferences<a class="footnote-ref" href="#godh2016"> [godh2016] </a>. The limitations of these efforts, though, reside in the unfunded mandate of this work as well as the linguistic limitations associated with the community itself<a class="footnote-ref" href="#spence_etal2021"> [spence_etal2021] </a>.</p>
<p>Despite having to pay for translations costs, working on translations themselves, and having to present and answer questions in their second or third language, non-native English speakers have felt coerced into submitting proposals and delivering papers in English in order to receive the attention of their colleagues. This complex set of organizational and cultural attitudes towards multilingual conferencing poses challenges that despite concerted efforts have not always panned out. A review of conference acceptance data across years shows that while in 2018 (Mexico City), about 18% of the accepted papers and posters were in a language other than English, this was nearly double the next-highest levels of conference multilinguality: there were about 9% non-English proposal accepted to the two preceding conferences (Krákow in 2016 and Montréal in 2017), but prior to 2016, the percentage of non-English papers was most often 0% or 1%, with a local high of just 4% in Lausanne in 2014. We have to look all the way back to the 2006 conference in Paris (which predates both ADHO and its officialDHconference designation) to find similar linguistic diversity: it included about 10% non-English papers. And although the 2016-2018 percentages on multilingualism may appear to represent a strongly positive current trend, in fact these statistics have since returned to just above their previous extreme low: the 2019 (Utrecht) conference included about 2% non-English presentations, and 2020 conference (to have been in Ottawa, but canceled due to COVID-19) included about 3% non-English acceptances despite a strong local French-speaking digital humanities community.</p>
<p>The most recent four years of the DH conference (2017–2020) offer case studies to examine the shifts in the implementation of the stated importance of linguistic diversity. DH2017 and DH2018, celebrated in Montreal and Mexico City respectively, were both officially bilingual. This included bilingual keynote presentations as well as panels that shared a topic or methodology but included papers in both languages. This was likely facilitated by having members in the program committees and/or the local organizers who were fluent in both languages and belonged to scholarly communities working across English-French and English-Spanish. We believe this may have encouraged submissions by reaching out to immediate networks. Conversely, the CfP for DH2019 in Utrecht explicitly stated that “The primary language of the conference will be English, but we warmly invite proposals written in other languages for which we have a sufficient pool of peer reviewers (German, Italian, French and Spanish)” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dh2019cfpe"> [dh2019cfpe] </a>. With a less active approach to multilingualism, expectedly, DH2019 saw very low submissions in languages other than English. This was particularly pronounced as the accepted program was the largest to date in the history of the Digital Humanities conference. In contrast, DH2020 in Ottawa explicitly solicited submissions in all five required ADHO languages and centered multiculturalism rather than linguistic diversity, bringing to the forefront native, indigenous and decolonial studies, while also acknowledging Ottawa’s official bilingualism. Yet, there were no submissions in Anishinàbemiwin/Algonquin and few in French. As a result,the primary languagedefaulted to English despite efforts to welcome non-English submissions.</p>
<p>As these examples suggest, despite the establishment of the MLMC and being a central concern within ADHO, the actual practice of multilingualism has varied widely and, unfortunately, has not yielded the diversity results it has been expected to — not in terms of linguistic diversity and certainly not in equity at large. It is undeniable that English continues to be a powerful and useful lingua franca in the field (which has been noted in other disciplines, however it has also been noted that this creates an excluding barrier in academic discourse in the conference setting<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fregonese2017"> [fregonese2017] </a>. However, it is also one that encodes modalities of writing and epistemologies of the academies that use it and implied notions of merit. Thus, among the most important obstacles is the human infrastructure required to evaluate proposals appropriately as we have argued in the section devoted to peer review. Likewise lacking is a conference infrastructure capable of accommodating multilingualism at every step of the conference process: from the conference management, to the publication of the CfP, to the reviewing of proposals, to the proceedings of live presentations, and then to the publication of conference papers.</p>
<p>The aspirations of the conference to be multilingual and for that multilingualism to be a conduit for equity and diversity are worth pursuing. Nevertheless, we believe that the prism of multilingualism that has been favored in ADHO, on its own, is not capacious enough to lead to more diversity, a just way of evaluating proposals, or a wider understanding of various academic cultures. Moreover, multilingualism is also too narrow to foster anti-hegemonic, anti-racist, anticolonial, gender-balanced conference practices and operations. Indeed, even in the instances where linguistic diversity was central to the conference, it alone has done little to address these parallel problems. Aside from instances where specific PC chairs have taken action, it has fallen upon groups outside of ADHO governance and of the various committees in charge of organizing the conference to bring these issues to the forefront. In recent years, Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH), a special interest group, has advocated not just for incorporating multilingualism beyond the CfP itself and in presentations and other aspects of the conference but also underscored how equity and diversity are multiplex<a class="footnote-ref" href="#godh"> [godh] </a>.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> A more expansive and deeper understanding of equity of diversity that does not rely on language representation needs to be deeply and thoroughly integrated into conference organization and ADHO governance.</p>
<p>In consideration of these issues, we urge ADHO to designate funds to diversity efforts. This will involve rethinking the role, function, and ambit of the Multi-Lingual Multi-Cultural committee (MLMC). Multilingualism is not capacious enough for diversity and equity aspirations nor has it been evenly applied at past conferences. Similarly, we encourage Local Organizers to budget funds for equity and diversity measures from the beginning. Elements which should be considered in the budget include live and printed translation costs, accessibility measures (<a href="#conclusion">see below</a>), and funding to support participants from underrepresented communities.</p>
<p>Lastly, we note that in order for ADHO to be accountable when it comes to its stated diversity commitments, the conference must gather data on diversity and equity and set clear timelines for goals, assessments, and consequences. ConfTool could be used to gather data related to biographical and demographic details. A standardized post-conference survey, which has not been utilized in previous years, could also be useful to gather information about what initiatives were effective or not in a given year. Further, initiatives demonstrated to be successful must have continuity, permanent financial support, and not be abandoned by future PC Chairs when they diverge from opinions held by chairs or their constituent organizations.</p>
<h2 id="the-show-must-go-on-but-not-as-we-know-it">The Show Must Go On… But Not as We Know It</h2>
<p>In any analysis of organizational behavior and processes, there is always a moment of exploring motivation. Throughout this paper, we’ve attempted to show how the best of intentions in the implementation of conference processes have, in fact, not led to the best of results. From our first-hand experiences and with conference data in hand, we offer the following suggestions to begin to improve the conference for conference organizers, participants, and beyond. While our suggestions may seem specific to ADHO, they may also serve as a gentle reminder to all conferences that their processes should be transparent and self-reflexive.</p>
<h2 id="codes-of-conduct">Codes of Conduct</h2>
<p>Codes of conduct with clear procedural policies are an important part of creating a welcoming conference environment.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> The Digital Humanities conference currently has a short code of conduct with room for Local Organizers to add information relevant to their event<a class="footnote-ref" href="#adhoccoc"> [adhoccoc] </a>. We recommend ADHO also adopt a robust and transparent complaints and conflict resolution process, which could be used in cases of problematic in-person and online behavior. The complaints system, furthermore, needs to extend to governance. Consequences for violations of the Code of Conduct (including issues around inappropriate reviewing) need to be clear, and if necessary, be communicated across conference cycles to ensure consistency and to avert opportunities for repeat offending. We recommend that ADHO employ an ongoing external ombudsperson, rather than having complaints handled by ADHO Executive, other committee members, or ad hoc appointees (who may or may not have had the appropriate training).</p>
<h2 id="transparency-in-documentation-and-data">Transparency in Documentation and Data</h2>
<p>We recommend that the DH conference publish the annual reports publicly each year, including local organizer, program committee, and conference coordinating committee reports.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> At an absolute minimum, these reports should be made available to current and future conference organizers at the start of their term. This should include information on acceptance statistics and the planning process.</p>
<p>We also note that ADHO has beenrisk aversewhen it comes to data practices and conference programming but NOT risk averse when it comes to other forms of hazard that it seems completely oblivious to. Without a complaints or conflict resolution process the conference is exposed to reputational and even legal risk. There is little consideration to broader definitions of risk such as the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) risk frameworks that are now widely adopted in other sectors. In particular we are concerned that there has not been an environmental impact audit of the conference. We also must consider more broadly the conflict between specific policies (for example data governance) and local hosting institutions whose local laws may supersede ADHO policies.</p>
<p>We recommend that ADHO create a digital preservation policy for conference materials, including the books of abstracts, conference schedule, reviewer pool, and recordings of keynote talks. Ideally, this digital preservation policy would be retrospective where possible, allowing the books of abstracts from past conferences to be findable from a single place, and, ideally, searchable. In order to facilitate this digital preservation, we recommend standardizing formats and submission procedures, which could also help with the workload involved in creating these materials. We note that having a paid ongoing ConfTool administrator would help facilitate this standardization.</p>
<h2 id="budget-and-infrastructure">Budget and Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Despite the finances of the conference being intimately tied to the financial health of ADHO constituent organizations, the conference budgeting and ADHO finances as a whole are remarkably opaque. An assessment is needed regarding how budgets are constructed and aligned to organizational values with particular attention to unpaid labor. Final budget documents should be made available publicly. Clarity and accountability on conference profits and losses are not currently discussed publicly; as a result, there needs to be transparency around financial models and their implementation, particularly given the tension around conference fee costs. Conferences should be transparent about the profits versus loss and should identify where all profits are being distributed and how they might be used.</p>
<p>We encourage conference organizers to create and share financial models used for conferences. Budgets should reflect the organizations’ commitments to, for instance, early career scholars, underrepresented populations, other precariously employed people, and those who are differently-abled. These commitments should be itemized and easily identified so that organizations can be held accountable for their use. Doing so will not only foster accountability with potential communities and partnership but will also allow for reparations for previous prejudices and discrimination in the field. We suggest that ADHO create paid conference support staff positions whose employment is evaluated based on the successful implementation of values and priorities. We also suggest that additional funding be devoted to deploying and preserving conference websites by ADHO.</p>
<p>The ConfTool conference system, for all of its powerful capabilities, needs to be developed further to address issues around multi-lingual submissions, multilingual reviewers, and the review assignment algorithm. Given ADHO’s commitment to this tool, there is a need to not only have a ConfTool administrator who works across conference years but also funds to address the algorithmic bias.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>Each year, the conference hosting venue should undertake a full accessibility audit for a range of both visible and invisible disabilities and access requirements, such as set out in the UK Event Accessibility Guide<a class="footnote-ref" href="#broadbent2017"> [broadbent2017] </a>. This should be broadly framed, from microphones to the requirement for accessible buildings, bursaries (students/underwaged/underrepresented), scaled registration fees (dependent on employment stage and institutional location), on-site support, lactation rooms, quiet rooms, and childcare. We recommend that this assessment be part of the selection of conference venues, so that accessibility is embedded into the choice of local hosts from the outset. We also suggest a post-conference assessment on accessibility to ensure accountability for these accommodations.</p>
<h2 id="ethical-labor">Ethical Labor</h2>
<p>As we’ve noted throughout this article, the ADHO conference would not exist without volunteer labor of organizers, reviewers, on-site staff etc. Yet, there is little sense regarding the scale of labor being used and how that labor might be reproducing inequities — particularly for women and Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and other underrepresented individuals. ADHO must conduct a study of labor associated with the conference to both quantify the amount of time devoted to the conference throughout the multiyear cycle but also address how volunteer labor might be compensated in the future. That report should be made publicly available and must establish accountability benchmarks to address inequity. This would likely include a basic conference staff that doesn’t change every year to ensure some level of continuity and to serve as an institutional memory of why things are the way they are. This would be more effective than tasking temporary (two-year) volunteer program committee members with learning and implementing things anew; additionally, it would be more effective than having to ask past PC chairs, a practice that many of us relied on when completing our work, that further extends their unpaid service to the organization. Additionally, should the conference proceed with volunteer labor, that labor should be clearly recognized and compensated with in-kind services (for example: free conference registration, reduced or free membership in a constituent organization for a set number of years, etc.) This is particularly important if student-based unpaid labor and those who are precariously employed are incorporated into the conference.</p>
<h2 id="embracing-digital-innovations">Embracing Digital Innovations</h2>
<p>Academic conferences were founded in a pre-modern model of knowledge exchange that embraced in-person presentation to stimulate sharing. This, though, does not address any of the innovations of digital sharing which might supersede the in-person event<a class="footnote-ref" href="#deklerk2021"> [deklerk2021] </a>. Throughout its long life, the ADHO Conference (until the COVID-19 crisis) has been belligerently non-digital. The entire organization of the event issurprisingly manual. Paper givers are expected to physically attend the event — whatever the cost. Posters are expected to be printed and pinned to a noticeboard. COVID-19 has given us an opportunity to put thedigitalback into the ADHO conference; COVID-19 has also demonstrated the opportunities that can be afforded by digital dissemination and virtual gathering models. Taking time zone differences into account, however, will be pivotal to make a truly global online networking experience.</p>
<p>To date, many of the complaints about the conference have appeared on social media (including Twitter) — in part because reporting guidelines are unclear and there is a perception that complaints raised directly to the organization are not addressed, or worse, hidden. We recommend that conference organizers embrace social media as a venue for conversation. An initial step might include a published social media policy, an explicitly-identified member of the CCC who is charged with social media management, and a public archive of all social media associated with the conference. ADHO must recognize that formal conference processes can be alienating and thus the community and ADHO must embrace both formal and informal complaint processes, such as those offered by social media users.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-who-and-how">Conclusion: Who and How?</h2>
<p>Above, we have outlined some suggestions for what can be done in the future, yet, without a consideration of who and how these changes can be enacted, the recommendations themselves are for naught. As some people may have heard many times, ADHO does not have members; rather, ADHO is composed of constituent organizations, which, in turn, have members. So then, how do we effect meaningful change? We all agreed to be program committee chairs because we felt we were part of a community and could contribute to the conference organization process. Helping shape a year’s discussion is, indeed, a privilege. Yet, as this article has outlined, there are bureaucratic procedures that can hamstring program committee chairs and that can exact a mental and emotional toll.</p>
<p>In our shared personal experience, immersing ourselves in the various facets of conference organization served to hinder rather than advance our commitment to ADHO and curtailed our professional accomplishments in the field. For most of us, the experience serving as program chairs led to a range of alienating experiences, the severity of which varied for each person: implicit and explicit harassment included bullying; social media and email harassment and threats; anxiety and depression; and professional burnout lasting years beyond the conference years as a result of the levels of work expected. These experiences are not one-offs; they are symptoms of systemic and ongoing problems. These costs to us are in addition to the impact of this work on our curriculum vitae, where the years serving as conference chairs are reflected gaps within our professional trajectory. We request that our experiences and concerns be recognized as systemically induced and addressed as such, particularly given that some perpetrators of these actions include people, mostly men, who remained in leadership roles in ADHO and the constituent organizations and flourish within the field. These frequently gendered encounters have not been recognized within conference processes and are instead often framed as personal failures of women chairs rather than issues of governance and accountability.</p>
<p>We call on both the ADHO Constituent Organization Board (COB) and Executive Board (EB) to be mindful of the labor, opportunities, benefits, and issues we have highlighted here around conference organization and hosting, to create a top-down (structural) approach to improving the conference for all involved.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> We also call on individual members of ADHO constituent organizations to raise issues and pledge support for increased conference diversity via their constituent organizations, to create a ground-up approach. In particular, senior academics in tenured (or similar) positions need to utilize the power that they have to bring these issues and suggestions to both ADHO and their CO. The issues raised here will not be solved once and for all overnight, but will require ongoing vigilance and monitoring to be sure that theBig Tentis as open to all as it can possibly be. This, in itself is labor — which conference organizing institutions should respect.</p>
<p>Conferences are collaborations that can shape the future of academic fields, and individual academic careers. We invite more conferences to reflect critically on their practices and how they can best support their communities, and believe that the recommendations we have provided here for ADHO will be applicable to, and should be considered for, most academic events.</p>

<p>Importantly, DH conferences held in Europe tend to trend higher in submissions while the number of reviewers remains relatively consistent. This is both a factor of the growth of DH in the many European nations as well as the proximity of the conference to various European nations. See Table 1 and Table 2 for an overview of submissions by type and the number of reviews.&#160;<a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Discussing academic conferences in general, Demeter contends, “we should abandon the pathetic practice of inviting only central keynote speakers to plenary sessions while enrolling our regional peers in parallel sessions, and abandon the myth that these practices ensure the value of an international conference….International conferences should be international in terms of keynote speakers as well, irrespectively of the location of the conference” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#demeter2020"> [demeter2020] </a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:21" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Please note that while our analysis here focuses on gender, there is also a need to undertake an intersectional analysis of DH keynote speakers that addresses issues of race, ability, rank, and more. We also wish to acknowledge the limitations of the binary gender framework within this portion of our analysis which should be further explored from a non-binary persepctive.&#160;<a href="#fnref:22" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Codes of conduct are appearing in more conferences and events and are available from many humanities organizations, including ADHO.

<p>We requested access to past Local Organizer reports from the ADHO Executive Board while researching this article but were denied. The rationale for denial included concerns ranging from issues around intellectual property in the reports, to conflicts of interest, issues of precedence, and past report authors’ expectations of privacy. Our requests and the responses serve to confirm the importance of publicly releasing reports and retrospectively releasing information from previous conferences.&#160;<a href="#fnref:26" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
