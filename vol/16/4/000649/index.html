<a href=http://doi.org/ rel=alternate class=page-doi>doi:</a></section><div class=text-container><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>The execution of Maximillian, Emperor of Mexico, by the army of Benito Juarez in 1867 had international ramifications, and the world became polarized. The press around the globe reported it and rallied the population in favor or against the event. In this analysis, we explore the underlying sentiments and emotions embedded in the texts that circulated inthe press, as a case study of the project Oceanic Exchanges, whose aim was to uncover how the international was refracted through the local as news, applying text mining methods to a corpus of national digitized nineteenth-century newspapers.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that regional emotional content variations of news reveal the political undertones and biases of information flows. The latter aspect is fostered by the fact that the execution of Maximilian was, from the outset, an incident that divided opinions.</p><p>To that goal, we put together a corpus that includes digitized newspapers from different regions in North America and Europe, encompassing material from the actual arena of the execution, Mexico, from the country of Maximilian&rsquo;s ancestry, Austria as well as from the US and Germany<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> that covered the news abundantly<a class=footnote-ref href=#priani2019> [priani2019] </a>. After dividing the corpus into geographical regions, we use quantitative methods –word frequency distributions and named entity recognition (NER)–to first look at the corpus. Then, using qualitative content analysis, we narrowed the information to compare the different regions. Finally, using automated sentiment analysis tools, we were able to compare the automatic analysis to the human one, showing a similar and clear sentimental trend in both methods depending on the geographical region: the Austrian/German press had a negative bias, while the Mexican newspapers showed a more positive picture, and the US showed mixed sentiments.</p><p>The case of Maximilian is particularly illuminating from the perspective of global news flows since it happened soon after the inauguration of the transatlantic cable in a country that was fighting a civil war between liberals and conservatives. The execution news tells a story of control and manipulation over the flow of news and, at the same time, a story that could be wired and rapidly forwarded over the Atlantic.</p><h2 id=historical-background>Historical background</h2><p>In 1860, Mexico was broken. The War of Independence (1810) bankrupted the country and fuelled endless confrontations between liberals and conservatives, who came and went in the presidency during the century.</p><p>Benito Juarez&rsquo;s introduction of the Reform Laws between 1855 and 1859 separated the Church from the State, suppressed military and religious tribunals, declared the nationalization of church properties, and introduced free press and civil registration, deepening the struggle between these political groups. In 1861, Benito Juárez, a liberal, was reelected to the presidency. With minimal financial resources, he decided to suspend the payment of debts and interests to Britain, Spain, and France.</p><p>According to Josefina Zoraida Vázquez (<a href=#vazquez2007>2007</a>), monarchists and conservatives living in Europe took advantage of this decision and proposed to Napoleon III the establishment of a Mexican monarchy. The idea that an Emperor could put an end to the turmoil was extensive among Mexican liberals and conservatives, as Duncan (<a href=#duncan1996>1996</a>) has pointed out, and with that support, the emperor of France saw the opportunity to extend his influence over America and stop the growing power of the United States.</p><p>On October 31, 1861, summoned by France, the three countries signed a treaty to block Mexico&rsquo;s ports on the Gulf of Mexico to pressure payment of the debt. After negotiations, Britain and Spain accepted new terms, but France refused and decided to invade Mexico.</p><p>After a year of confrontations, the invaders took the capital. Juárez&rsquo;s government was exiled but continued a guerrilla-style confrontation all over the country. Two years later, on April 10, 1864, Maximilian of Habsburg –brother of the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I and married to Charlotte of Belgium, daughter of King Leopold–, accepted the Mexican throne and traveled to the country.</p><p>In the last months of 1865, circumstances changed. The end of the Civil War in the United States opened the doors to new credits to Juárez, which helped fortify his army. At the same time, the French army abandoned Mexico, and the Maximilian government went bankrupt and started losing battles and territory.</p><p>In May 1867, Maximilian was captured –along with commanders Miguel Miramón and Tomás Mejía– by the Republican Army Commanded by Mariano Escobedo in the City of Querétaro in central México. Juárez and his Foreign Affairs secretary, Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada, resisted international pressure to exile Maximilian back to Europe in the following month. After a short trial, on June 19, 1867, Maximilian was executed at the Cerro de las Campanas, Querétaro, along with the last remaining commanders of the conservative army (Vanderwood 2010, 367-8). This execution resulted in an abundant flow of news analyzed in this article.</p><h2 id=corpora-description>Corpora description</h2><p>Our corpus<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> was obtained by searchingMaximilianandDeathin digitized European, Mexican, and United States newspaper collections (on the nature of these collections, see<a class=footnote-ref href=#beals2020> [beals2020] </a>). The US papers originated from Chronicling America, maintained by the Library of Congress, the Mexican papers from Hemeroteca Nacional Digital de México. For the German-language press, we drew on the Europeana dataset, which includes newspapers from Germany (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Hamburg State Library and Teßmann Library) and Austria (Österreichische Nationalbibliothek). In order to work with the German-language corpus, we automatically extracted the newspapers&rsquo; publication city and further divided the corpus into two regional categories: German and Austrian, resulting in a final corpus of 1,382 news stories published between the 5th and 20th of July 1867. Although Maximilian&rsquo;s execution took place two weeks earlier, on June 19, 1867, the news did not break until later because of the control of the Juarez&rsquo;s army over the telegram around Queretaro and the flow of the news from there<a class=footnote-ref href=#mendezmoreno1967> [mendezmoreno1967] </a>.</p><p>Neither the size of the corpora nor the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) quality was the same for all subcorpora. Cultural, political, and economic differences in each region affected the number of newspapers circulating. Mexico was going through a political crisis, and there was much control over the press. On the contrary, the United States had a lot of local newspapers. These differences result in an imbalance in news coverage, and therefore in the regional corpora. The US news occupies as much as 53.1% of the news coverage in the whole dataset. The proportion of the Austrian subcorpus is 12.6%, the German one 32.5 % and the Mexican one only 1.8 %.</p><p>In addition to the imbalance of digitized contents, another common obstacle is the quality of the original OCR from each newspaper library (on the problem of OCR noise, see<a class=footnote-ref href=#jarlbrink2017> [jarlbrink2017] </a>). Each nation establishes its newspaper digitization methodology, determining the quality and how and what can be extracted from each source. The OCR processes have been different, including the scanning practices and OCR software and the quality of the original newspapers, the objects of scanning. In most cases, the scanning has been done from microfilm, not from paper, and the original typeset, characters, and font sizes cause variation in the quality of OCR.</p><p>As a part of the Oceanic Exchanges Project, we decided to work with the OCR from each library without cleaning it. According to Beals and Bell (<a href=#beals2020>2020</a>), the Oceanic Exchanges corpus OCR quality ranges between 60-85%, but it varies within each country&rsquo;s corpora. Nonetheless, as Ryan Cordell pointed out, “methods such as text mining rely not on the nineteenth-century newspapers themselves, but on those newspapers as a remediated by mass digitization, a phrase that shorthands elaborate systems of scholarship, preservation, bureaucracy, human labor, machine processes, and economics” <a class=footnote-ref href=#cordell2017>[cordell2017] </a>.</p><p>However, following this path, we faced two challenges: one practical and one human. The practical challenge was that the US and Mexican subcorpora had poor OCR quality compared to the Austrian and German. The human challenge was that as an international team, participants from different countries have different scholarship cultures. The Mexican team, for example, was not familiar with working with dirty OCR and, because the corpus was not large, decided to transcribe all of their news items.</p><p>We decided to work with the Mexican corpus as it was prepared by the Mexican team, respecting its work and effort. In the case of the US subcorpus, the automatic extraction included everything on the page, and there were no breaks between news stories and columns –like in the German and Austrian corpus. The raw data included the news item about Maximilian&rsquo;s death and any other news stories on the page, making it hard to work with. Since there were thousands of hits, we narrowed the information down through an automated process, i.e, filtering chunks of surrounding text (windows of words to the right and to the left) wereMaximilianis mentioned. This eliminated most of the unwanted information, although it was a superficial strategy prone to some noise. As we assume newspapers are remediated by mass digitization, we also assume that our corpus expresses how digital humanities are produced in global teams that must manage cultural and technological differences. Finally, Table 1 shows the size of the text corpora (in terms of number of words) that we used for our analysis.<br>Corpora sizeCorpusTokensTypes (unique words)Austria (German)15401225590Germany (German)6876314495Mexico (Spanish)206734022US (English)27311533773</p><h2 id=methodology>Methodology</h2><p>We employed several methodologies to study the sentiments and emotions in news stories that circulated in the press after the execution of Maximilian I, the Mexican emperor. First, we used existing digital tools that draw on NLP, a multidisciplinary field aiming to automatically process large amounts of natural language data, and we performed qualitative analysis of the automatically extracted named entities (discussed below). After this process, we analyzed the emotional contents of the corpora by drawing on such automatic NLP tools. In recent years, sentiment analysis has been applied to extensive collections of news, online product reviews, and other types of corpora. However, little attention has been paid to historical news documents<a class=footnote-ref href=#sprugnoli2016> [sprugnoli2016] </a>. Few works have applied sentiment analysis to drama plays, literary texts, and other types of historical sources<a class=footnote-ref href=#schmidt2018a> [schmidt2018a] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#schmidt2018b>[schmidt2018b] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#kim2018>[kim2018] </a>.</p><p>In our case, we used automatic tools based on machine learning techniques to detect named entities and estimate a text&rsquo;s polarity. Thus, these systems are not based on explicit rules for each language; instead, they rely on statistical methods trained in large amounts of data. Particularly, we used Google Cloud<a href=https://cloud.google.com/natural-language>Natural Language API</a>, Python programming and the<a href=https://www.nltk.org/>NLTK toolkit</a>to pre-process the documents and extract information.</p><p>Our initial point of departure was to extract general statistics to explore the word frequency distributions in each subcorpus. This provided a general overview of the relevant terms in each region. It is essential to mention that the corpora were pre-processed, i.e., we tokenized it and filtered the stopwords that do not carry semantic content (prepositions, determiners, conjunctions, function words). We then used Named Entity Recognition (NER), Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology that automatically identifies words (or sequence of words) that belong to specific categories, i.e., abstract or physical entities denote proper names. Previously, these tools have been used to analyze nineteenth-century newspapers, but never in tandem to study news stories&rsquo; underlying sentiments and emotions. For example, some international projects are using NLP to study big data corpora, as well as developing analytical and visualization tools, like the Media Monitoring of the Past (2020) and the NewsEye (2020) projects, as well as Gale&rsquo;s Digital Scholar Lab (2020), which offers several NLP tools for researchers.</p><p>There is a growing body of knowledge about the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to analyze newspaper collections<a class=footnote-ref href=#neudecker2014> [neudecker2014] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#mac2015>[mac2015] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#kettunen2017>[kettunen2017] </a>. Likewise, there is an interest in identifying and making more robust computerized tools for historical newspapers analysis<a class=footnote-ref href=#yang2011> [yang2011] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#ehrmann2020>[ehrmann2020] </a>.</p><p>There are several approaches for performing NER tasks. In our case, we automatically identified the following entities in the documents: person, location, organization, event, consumer good, and others (using Google Cloud Natural Language API). We extracted named entities from the subcorpora of Austria, Mexico, Germany, USA. Once we automatically identified named entities for each subcorpus, we performed a manual selection of entities. This selection was based on three criteria: 1) frequency of the entity, 2) the entity appears in at least two regions, 3) it has historical significance –understood as it references an important event, person, location, or organization in the shooting of Maximilian.</p><p>We identified the reduced set as &ldquo;entities of interest.&rdquo; It was helpful to make a contrastive analysis across subcorpora, i.e., the different approaches to specific events, persons, locations, or organizations., depending on the country.</p><p>To facilitate the analysis of these entities of interest, we extracted contexts for each entity in the text. We defined context as a window of 20 words to the left and the right of each entity (fixed size), as seen in Table 2. Moreover, we extracted a list of words that appear in similar contexts to each entity of interest using NLP techniques and the NLTK toolkit. Then, Google Translate API was used to automatically translate the extracted contexts into English. Since we were a multilingual team and we worked with a corpus in several languages, we chose English as the lingua franca to communicate and work. Early on, we decided to translate all the news stories into English, adding certain complications to the analysis, which were controlled but never entirely eliminated.<br>An example of an named entity of interest (“execution”) in the Mexican subcorpusCity/RegionNewspaperDateOriginal ContextTranslated ContextCiudad de México, MéxicoMonitor Republicano05 July, 1867e militar y cumplido el plazo , fueron sacados los reos al patíbulo ; al llegar al lugar de la ejecución , se contuvo por orden del Supremo_Gobierno , que prorrogó el plazo por otros tres días . El 1and military and met the deadline, the prisoners were taken to the gallows; to get to the place of execution, it was held by order of Supremo_Gobierno, which extended the deadline for another three days. The 1<br>Finally, we ran an Automatic Sentiment Analyzer on the news of each corpus. Automatic sentiment analysis is the task of identifying and quantifying the polarity of an opinion expressed in a written text, e.g., positive or negative. This is done employing NLP and text mining techniques<a class=footnote-ref href=#liu2012> [liu2012] </a><a class=footnote-ref href=#feldman2013>[feldman2013] </a>.</p><p>The automatic sentiment analysis provided a negative, positive or neutral sentimental score for the newspaper publications. This allowed us to determine if there were underlying differences between regions.Since we are using models already trained by Google Cloud Natural Language API, no external dictionaries of setiment/polarity words are needed to perform this task.</p><p>We performed a qualitative content analysis<a class=footnote-ref href=#fernandez2002> [fernandez2002] </a>to identify attitudes, beliefs, wishes, values, and interest to understand the sentiments and emotions underlying the corpus&rsquo; news stories and identify geographical differences. We extracted the textual contexts for the named entities for each region. Each entity was analyzed, and main sentiments and emotions were pinpointed by identifying words that carried emotional content, such asdisgust, horror, revulsionfor the entityexecution.This produced an organic identification of sentiment categories in the new stories selected by region, which allowed us to compare and contrast, thus understanding how Maximilian&rsquo;s death was perceived.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that the used automatic tools are not explicitly adapted to specific domains such as historical news documents. However, these statistical methods can cope, to some extent, with language variation and diachrony. This means that they do not rely on fixed lexicons and rules. Instead, they focus on different features of the text to predict how likely it is that a token is a maned entity, e.g., the structure of the sentence, distributional semantics of the words, and training with millions of examples before. Due to this, our methodology does not entirely rely on the automatic tool&rsquo;s output, but it is complemented with a fine-grained qualitative analysis.</p><h2 id=results>Results</h2><p>This section discusses the results obtained using statistical distributions, NER tools, content analysis, and automated sentiment analysis<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> .</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Two word clouds with blue, green, and purple text.

Function words were automatically eliminated to work only with content-filled items. Just for the sake of illustration, Figure 1 shows word clouds with the most frequent words in Austria’s and Mexico’s corpora.</p><p>Going into more detail, Figure 2 displays the relative frequency of the top 10 most frequent words per region. These plots show which concepts were the most used per region:maximilian,emperor,andmexicowere at the top of all of the regions, of course — followed by items such asgovernmentanddeath.Since this is what the news reports were about, they are expected.</p><p>Nonetheless, the ones that are not repeated are also important to our study. For example, in Mexico&rsquo;s media,republic,president,andQueretaro–the city where Maximilian was apprehended and shot–, stand out, whileemperorimperial,majesty,andparisfrancehave more preponderance in the European press. In other words, this exposes a Eurocentric point of view: for the old continent, it was more important to refer to European cities and the idea of a Mexican Empire –since this was the power system held over there– while to Mexico’s press, Queretaro is an important city to the country, and the Republican president had just taken over.</p><p>Given we only show the top 10 words, some terms may appear in every regional media but without the same relevance. Some European newspapers did use words likerepublic,but they got ranked lower in frequency. Likewise, terms likeemperorandempireare not ranked in the top 10 for Mexico&rsquo;s corpus but appear in lower frequency ranks, as seen in Figure 2.</p><p>It is important to mention that the plots show relative frequencies to make them more easily comparable across corpora, i.e., each word count is divided by the total number of words in the current corpus. As mentioned, the data is unbalanced from the outset. The US material is abundant while other subcorpora are limited.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Four bar charts with bars in mauve.

Since NER techniques enlist all entities in the subcorpora, meaning thousands of results, we decided to only focus on the 100 most frequent entities. Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 in the following section show the named entities frequency distribution for each region.</p><p>Although we revised the 100 most frequent entities, we only show the 30 most frequent entities on the plots for the sake of illustration. For complete results, see the repository.</p><p>The range of absolute frequency values is larger in regions like Austria or Germany than in Mexico. This is due to the unbalanced nature of the corpora, i.e., the sociopolitical factors that impacted the amount of news produced in each country.</p><p>The automatic NER techniques faced some problems when dealing with this corpora. Sometimes, the algorithm detected non-content words that did not provide relevant information, although they belonged to a specific NER category, e.g.,sir,man,mister.</p><p>The algorithm was also affected by the OCR errors, since in some cases, it could mislabel broken words, e.g.,sp,gr,schorm,as named entities, registered in all regions to some extent. However, these mislabelings did not constitute a major problem since they were not within the most frequent named entities.</p><p>Moreover, orthographic variations also had an impact on the frequency distributions. For instance, we could find entities like Mexico or Maximilian written differently and with different frequencies associated.</p><p>In the end, we tried to be careful with all these considerations. We eliminated errors and normalized the variations to take them as a single entity.</p><p>Table 3 shows the selectedentities of interestlist for the content analysis from all the entities.

In other words, some articles reappeared in different newspapers, occurring both within and between regions. This points to the fact that there is a cultural resemblance among them, viewing Maximilian&rsquo;s shooting through a similar lens: a negative one in the European press. We found a similar situation in the United States newspaper. Table 4 shows an example of these repetitions. Meanwhile, in the Mexican press, this was not as common. This probably is the case because new information from far away was harder to get, and articles were reused.</p><p>This implies that the emotions, at least in part, are a result of external factors. The newspaper&rsquo;s position is determined not just by an editorial decision but also by the need to fill space, lack of a correspondent, or the popularity of a particular text. This is also important to consider when analyzing the score from the automatic sentiment analysis because reprints will bias the results.<br>Examples of reprints between newspapers of different regionsCity/RegionNewspaperDateOriginal ContextTranslated ContextFürth, GermanyDer Fortschritt (Der Fortschritt auf allen Gebieten des öffentlichen Lebens)06 July, 1867„ Der unglückliche Fürst , welcher von allen Mächten anerkannt war , wollte nach dem Abzug der Franzosen noch einen äußerste Versuch wagen , seine Anhänger zu retten .

The study of the entities of interest showed two different points of view about Maximilian&rsquo;s shooting: the Mexican press tends towards neutrality with a bit of positivity, and the European and United States press inclines to a neutral-negative position.

Most of the published documents in Mexican newspapers are the telegrams sent between Mariano Escobedo, head of the military army in Queretaro, and Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada, Minister of State to President Juarez, in San Luis Potosi, discussing the procedure, trial, and shooting of Maximilian. We found few opinion pieces (op-ed) in the corpus, which leads us to think that there was governmental control of the press, not an unprecedented situation in Mexico. The situation is kept under control by publishing short, non-emotional telegrams, probably avoiding a more prominent international situation. After the breakthrough of telegram connections, international news events were often quickly reported through this technology that favored short notices: longer texts, with more emotional undertones and editorial considerations, came with a delay<a class=footnote-ref href=#oiva2019> [oiva2019] </a>.</p><p>In the Austrian and German press, as well as in the United States newspapers, there is a clear negative sentiment towards the execution of Maximilian, and it is expressed through the use of adjectives such asdisgust,horror,revulsion,regrettable,tremendous sensation,without mercy,shameful,pain,sadness,vigorously protested. For example, Regensburger Anzeiger in Germany wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Emperor Maximilian was handed his opponents in his sleep. The assassination of the Emperor Maximilian will excite general disgust. This infamous, arranged from Juarez (July 06, 1867).<br><sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup><br>Similarly, outlets from the United States expressed a negative sentiment by describing the execution with words likedenouncing crime against humanity,indignation,horror,brutal,infamous,question international law,compared toLouis XVI. In the Mexican press, the worddeathmainly refers to the death sentence in the published official telegrams. Sometimes, though, it exposed fake news from the time because they reported about Charlotte&rsquo;s death in Europe and Miramón succumbing to his war injuries. Both did not happen at the time, but they seem to help the official narrative emotionally.</p></blockquote><p>The German and Austrian press useddeathin different ways. Some reports exalt Maximilian&rsquo;s positive characteristics:honorable,good,noble,brave,amiable,chivalrous,prince. Others concentrate on blaming and finding out who was ultimately responsible for his death: Napoleon for abandoning him in Mexico or the United States for not stopping Juarez. The third type of news story was about European royals and dignitaries mourning. The US press paints his death as unfavorable by condemning it. The use ofexpeditionandcatastrophe(disaster) also alludes to sentiments. Expedition refers to England, Spain, and France&rsquo;s 1862 invasion of Mexico, which led to Maximilian&rsquo;s proclamation as emperor. German and Austrian newspapers, on the one hand, present some criticism towards the expedition, particularly towards France and Napoleon III. On the other, they call for an immediate new expedition to avenge the destiny of the Austrian Prince. The newspapers from the United States also use the termexpeditionto refer to the attack the European countries charged against Mexico but do not publish anything about a new expedition.</p><p>In a similar matter,catastrophe– meaning an emotional disaster, not a natural one– is a window into the sentimental biases of the press. While theMexican Expeditionwas good, Maximilian&rsquo;s death is aMexican Disasterin the Austrian and German corpora. In other words, for some of the European press, an expedition that cost thousands of lives the death of one person is a disaster, but the killing of thousands of Mexicans during the war is an expedition. As seen in the previous analysis of entities, language indicates the newspapers&rsquo; point of view (see Appendix 1c and 1d).</p><p>Meanwhile in the Mexican press,expeditionandcatastrophewere found only once but were depicted differently: the expedition is unfortunate, and the results of the expedition were catastrophic. In other words, Maximilian&rsquo;s death is not perceived as a disaster. The English, Spanish and French invasion was a military intervention to the Mexican press, which became historically known as theFrench Intervention(see appendix 1e).</p><p>For the entity of person, the most notable names or political figures that constantly appear in the news are president, Maximilian, prince, Magnus, and French people. Once again, they are used differently depending on the regional context (see Figure 4).</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Four bar charts with bars in mauve.

(Stormy interruption.) President Schneider: The last words de «honorable gentleman JnleS Favre could be facing the whole country” (Das Vaterland, Wien, July 13, 1867).<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Since Juarez won the war against Maximilian, being referred to as President is expected, as happened in the USA press. But the European press never mentions Juarez as president, showing how newspapers use the title as a way to accept or refuse his authority. This does not mean that there are no occurrences, but they are rare.</p><p>We found the opposite situation with the itememperor.While it is true that it is used in all regions, there are essential differences that contrast with the use of president. Primarily,emperorrefers to Maximilian and Franz Joseph of Austria and Napoleon III of France. Nonetheless, in the Mexican press, it is used to refer mostily to Maximilian and is followed by negative descriptors, such asusurper: the use of appellatives reveals the emotional underlying of news stories (see appendix 1g).</p><p>A similar situation happens in the last three entities –prince,Magnus,andFrench people– (see appendix 1h).Prince,referring to Maximilian, usesunfortunate,noble,andbraveadjectives in the German and Austrian papers. In the Mexican publications, he is alluded to asprince of Europeor, in some cases, asprisoner prince.For the rest of the newspapers, the word is not associated with anything directly linked to Maximilian&rsquo;s death.</p><p>Magnus was a central person to Maximilian&rsquo;s shooting because he was his lawyer during the trial. Many Mexican papers mentioned him because he was constantly talked about in governmental correspondence. He is also mentioned in other international newspapers because we detected a reprint of a letter he sent. Nonetheless, he does not appear among the first 100 frequently used person entities.</p><p>French Peoplewas an interesting case because it is mainly used in the German-language newspapers to assign blame for abandoning Maximilian in Mexico to his death. It is also used similarly in the USA. In Mexico, this term does not appear. Both the mentioning or lack of it helped understand the underlying sentiment in news publications in this entity. For example,Juarez!does not appear among the most frequent terms in European newspapers. The algorithm probably causes this due to an OCR problem: parts of his name can be read often, but often cut. If the materials were cleaned, Juarez would probably become more prominent.</p><p>Worldandcitywere the two most relevant location entities. Many cities are mentioned because they refer to the publishing place and important landmarks or battles, but allusions to Paris and Vienna were most common. In Mexico, the press refers to Queretaro constantly. The US papers mainly mention Mexico City. There were few references to the Cerro de la campana, where Maximilian was shot (figure 5).</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Four bar charts with bars in mauve.

Also, there was a distinction between the civilized world and the barbarians and between the old and new world. There are allusions to a shock to the civilized, Christian, and old-world in the USA.</p><p>Other entities asrepublicandcountryare persistent in some regions but not in others, although they appear in all the corpora (see appendix 1i). For example,republicis constantly alluded to in the Mexican press, especially the president, while this is rarely done in European material. The US press does acknowledge this form of government in Mexico. On the other hand, the country often does not appear in the Mexican newspapers, but it does in the Austrian next to words such asbarbariansormisfortune.This antagonism helps create a negative sentiment towards Maximilian&rsquo;s death. Nonetheless, since his shooting was perceived as a positive moment in Mexico, the negative adjectives and points of view are not frequent.</p><blockquote><p>of justice but an act of Mexican revenge and one that will be deprecated by the whole civilized world . We reprobate the attempt to establish a foreign empire in Mexico , but feel pity for the two c (The Evening Argus, Rock Island IL, July 05, 1867)</p></blockquote><p>The last of the entities isorganization(figure 6). In this category, two items stood up:armyandSupreme governmentorgovernment (see appendix 1j). Each region gave more prevalence to different armies: in the Mexican press, most mentions are about theEjército del Norte,Marino Escobedo&rsquo;s North Division; for the German and Austrian press, most references are made to the French army abandoning Mexico and leaving Maximilian to his fate, while few mentions allude to Juarez&rsquo;s Liberal Army. Similarly, the Mexican press -and sometimes the US media-usesSupreme Governmentto write about Juarez&rsquo;s administration. . Meanwhile, in the European press, it primarily refers to the European governments.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="Four bar charts with bars in mauve.

While in Mexico,Supreme Governmentappears many times since that is how they referred to Juarez&rsquo;s government. In Europe, these words allude to the governments of that continent and only sometimes to the Mexican one. The same thing happens witharmy.In both instances, it is clear that, for the Europeans, what matters tends to be local issues, while in Mexico, Juarez dealings tend to be exalted.</p><blockquote><p>I Mejía.- 21 1861.- General Mariano Escobedo Citizens division, chief corps of Norte.- Queretaro.

We have averaged the score of all news stories published by each newspaper in the different regions in these plots. Also, it can be observed how the number of sources varies in each region. The Austrians and Germans wrote many news stories showing a general tendency to one side of the sentiment continuum. For example, the Austrian bar chart has mostly negative stories, while the Mexican bar chart has mainly positive stories. We have excluded the USA from these visualizations since, for this particular case, we did not preserve the newspaper source information for each news story. This is due to the OCR cleaning and pre-processing steps involved in this specific database, where we had to filter just the text portions with relevant information about the Maximilian case. Still, the graph shows the sentiment distribution of the news stories, albeit without the name of the newspapers (see appendix 2).</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt="three bar charts, the first two have bars in mauve and the last has bars in green.

Mexican newspapers are inclined towards a positive direction, while European newspapers and those from the United States are prone to consider Maximilian&rsquo;s shooting as negative.. Meanwhile, the Mexican press shows an alliance with the government in power, meaning Juarez&rsquo;s republic. They only printed official statements and communications from the events, meaning telegraphic messages between Mariano Escobedo in Queretaro&rsquo;s battlefront and Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada –Minister of Foreign Affairs under Juarez– in San Luis Potosi. Since they are mostly short and to the point messages, the sentiment analysis results closer to neutrality. The United States, while it might not agree with the imperial governmental system, opposes the actions taken by Juarez. Therefore, news stories tend to focus on the negative aspects of the shooting. The German newspapers are less extreme than the Austrian ones, maybe because Maximilian was an Austrian prince.</p><p>Nonetheless, the averages are very low since both sides are very close to neutrality. It should be considered that newspapers, as an institutional ethos, tend to strive for certain neutrality. Although not always achieved –like songs, poems and op-ed can be found– it does tend towards the middle and away from extreme views.</p><p>In summary, the use of fully automated tools to measure sentiment in newspapers about Maximilian shooting provided similar results to the analysis previously done using other techniques –such as content analysis, obtaining the frequency of common words and named entities–, which shows that these digital techniques can identify the underlying ideological positions from each region. It is important to mention that the differences are small but significant enough to evidence the variations.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This study has focused on the international news flows on the execution of Maximilian, the Emperor of Mexico. The execution took place in June 1867, and the news started to flow across borders at the beginning of July, reaching global readership through newspapers. The aim of this study has been twofold. First, the study concentrated on finding ways of analyzing sentiments in a multilingual research setting. Second, it was to investigate the regional differences in sentiments evoked by the execution in the press internationally.</p><p>This study has explored the use of several digitized newspaper corpora on a transnational scale. It has drawn on newspapers from four regions: Austria, Germany, Mexico, and the United States in three languages. We selected the timeframe from 5 July to 20 July, extracted the news on the execution from the available corpora, and explored this multilingual data set with several strategies.</p><p>Contentwise, our article has been the first study on the transnational reception of a significant news event of its time, the execution of the Emperor of Mexico. It has covered newspapers from two continents and four geographical regions. The case itself is illuminating from the perspective that it happened very near to the inauguration of the transatlantic telegraph cable and indicates how quickly news circulated. The execution was a politically loaded media event that aroused mixed feelings and ambiguous emotions. The execution was not only a domestic case to Mexico because the United States and some European countries were deeply involved in the affair. Our analysis shows content variations in the corpora, meaning that the news was framed differently in each studied region, indicating that the local perception of the event and polítical interests shaped the news. In our corpus, the Mexican press –published in the middle of a political crisis– tended towards a neutral stance, the Austrian and German papers mainly were negative, and the United States showed mixed sentiments on the incident.</p><p>Our study faced two limitations that have to be addressed in most newspaper projects in the digital humanities. On the one hand, the size of each subcorpora varied because of cultural, political, and economic reasons. On the other hand, digitized newspapers have been optically recognized with an OCR software based on particular scanning practices, which produced differences in quality. However, we argue that it is possible to transgress the OCR problem and the multilingual nature of the data, as we have done, and conduct transnational research. We drew on quantitative solutions such as named-entity recognition, frequency distributions, and textual context analysis in conjunction with qualitative analysis. This permitted us to study the underlying sentiments in the newspapers from the nineteenth century. We have a significant outcome contrasting the result of automatic sentiment analysis tools combined with quantitative and qualitative analysis that suggested the automatic sentiment analysis tools results are trustworthy for our nineteenth-century newspaper corpus.</p><h2 id=appendix>Appendix</h2><p>1- Examples of various entities of interest’s context, region, source and date.</p><p>Appendix 1a.
