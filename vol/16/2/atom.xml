<p>New entertainment technologies are creating technical, intellectual, and HR challenges. The problems extend from issues of technology integration to enabling and critiquing hybrid forms of expression that defy categorisation, and finding employees with the skills needed to thrive in the industry. Products powered by artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and immersive technologies (AR, VR, chatbots, games, interactive story dramas, and affective systems) are technically complex to design and build, and require diverse teams including writers, designers, developers, artists, and project managers <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. New multimedia and transmedia design and engineering paradigms need to be found to foster innovation, and new career paths and skillsets are needed to enable creative production. Without solutions to these problems the United Kingdom’s £100bn investment in creative industries will stand little chance of success. To compete, small to medium enterprises (SME) are engaging in high-risk R&amp;D to find new ways to build talent and manage production. They need the support of research software engineering (RSE) and academic partners to ensure technical, creative, and intellectual quality. Digital humanities teams have an important part to play in this process.</p>
<p>These issues have become a focus of the UK government’s research and funding policy, coupled to a wider industrial strategy designed to retain the country’s global competitiveness. The problem domain provides a classic example of Henry Etzkowitz and Loet Leydesdorff&rsquo;s triple helix of industry-government-university collaboration (<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>) and an opportunity to explore the potential of applied methods in Digital Humanities (DH). This article describes one such experiment, demonstrating theories and methods that can facilitate the application of DH perspectives to the creative industries and (by extension) the skills and career pathways needed to produce people capable of delivering such work.</p>
<p>Section I describes the project at the heart of the paper,  “Applying AI to Storytelling — bringing computational research into the creative industries”  (Applying AI), a collaboration between a London technology start-up specialising in immersive narrative storytelling (Charisma Entertainment), and researchers and engineers at King’s College London. Applying AI offers important insights into the challenges of producing non-linear and affective technological systems and narrative content that aspire to world-building and intensive human-computer interaction (HCI). Section II explains why this project is best understood theoretically in terms of applied or  “interested methods”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and its relationship to global trends in academic research. Section III provides socio-technical, economic, and theoretical context for the experiment, to position it within the United Kingdom’s funding and policy environment and frame it with relevant scholarly literature. Section IV outlines potential new production pipelines capable of enabling the production of immersive products, and the need to develop people with blended creative and technical skills, and Section V describes the challenges of knowledge transfer and pedagogy in emergent convergent zones such as the UK’s creative economy. In taking this ambitiously holistic approach, bringing a broad conceptual apparatus to bear on the problem of immersive engineering in DH, we hope to open multiple avenues simultaneously and prompt conversations about future directions in research, engineering, pedagogy, and career development.</p>
<h2 id="section-i-applying-ai-to-storytelling--bringing-computational-research-into-the-creative-industries">Section I: Applying AI to Storytelling — bringing computational research into the creative industries</h2>
<p>The project  “Applying AI to Storytelling — bringing computational research into the creative industries”  (Applying AI) brought together two streams of inquiry. The first was centred around embedding a DH RSE from King’s Digital Lab (KDL) within a creative industry SME (Charisma Entertainment), to function as a connection point between industry and academia. The aim was to facilitate traffic in ideas and methods between the creative industries, RSEs, and academics, and to overcome cultural and institutional barriers that inhibit collaboration. It also sought to develop career pathways and skills for RSEs to help them work effectively with industry through embedded co-creation, understanding the culture and working practices of a start-up and how they align with RSE practice. This work was led by James Smithies of KDL, with Elliott Hall as the KDL RSE who would embed with the SME. A workshop on RSE/Industry collaboration was held midway through the project, bringing together representatives from higher education, the creative industries, and related fields to disseminate the project’s work on collaboration and to generate feedback on how it could be taken forward in the future.</p>
<p>The second stream of research was led by Sarah Atkinson and centred around evolving new working principles, practices, and workflows in the creation of interactive and immersive narratives and the development of the charisma.AI interactive media platform. This work package was the primary reason Charisma Entertainment approached King’s College London for assistance. The optimisation and refinement of the machine learning algorithms that powered their charisma.AI platform was essential in creating compelling and rounded human characters and convincing character interactions between the AI and the audience, and (crucially) AI-character memory. This raised complex issues relating to the creative writing process. The work package involved an initial workshop for new media authors, writers, and narrative designers to adapt and adopt their established working practices for an AI environment where character memory was of profound importance. Charisma Entertainment needed the narratives generated for charisma.AI to be subjected to critical examination in both literary and social science terms, identifying how conscious and unconscious bias informs the author’s conception of the character and the player’s responses to it.</p>
<p>A second workshop involved audience and user testing, enabling feedback and responses to be provided to the creative team. The initial shape of the collaboration was designed for Hall to take on a facilitation role during production of the project’s showcase demo. He was to use his skills as a published novelist and RSE to enhance a collaboration between Charisma Entertainment and Parabolic Theatre, a performance theatre company known in London for their immersive show  <em>For King and Country</em> . The aim was to adapt the show into a Unity-based game that would use charisma.AI for all character interactions.  <em>For King and Country</em>  was chosen as a demo because it would stretch the capabilities of the charisma.AI platform. An example of a relatively new genre of theatre, associated with a broader trend towards immersive experiences <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, the show has proven to be a popular experience in London. Its narrative is compelling: Germany is winning World War Two and about to invade the UK. The audience meets in a rump parliament, then splits off to work in the various ministries before coming back to parliament to hear the results of their work: has the UK been defeated, or has their work repulsed the invasion? The aim was to create a game demo that would replace the actors and facilitators with AI characters, and for audiences to interact as avatars in the game. The characters would interact with the audiences through text-based conversation and (of fundamental importance) remember and sometimes misremember what they had said. The AI characters had been programmed so that they could also lie and remember when they were lied to.</p>

<p>In many ways, charisma.AI is the latest iteration of a long-standing tradition in electronic and interactive literature, which spanned chatbots such as Eliza (1964 - 1966), early iconic text-based games known as Multi-User Dungeons (MUDS), and hypertext fiction that once held great promise for the development of new modes of narrative experience. Such products were related to the well-known  <em>Twistaplot</em>  and  <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em>  children’s books of the 1980s, and culturally related to the popular  <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>  board game. Works like Michael Joyce’s  <em>Afternoon, a story</em>  (1987), built using Eastgate Systems’ Storyspace tool, were claimed by some critics to augur a new era of ergodic literature. In 1997 Espen Aarseth claimed such  “hypertext literature”  produced</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a short circuit between signifier and signified, a suspension of differance [accent on the e] that projects an objective level beyond the text, a primary metaphysical structure that generates both textual sign and our understanding of it, rather than the other way around. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><br>
The belief was that new technologies were radically transforming the experience of reading from a passive to an (inter)active experience. 1990s critics noted similarities between ergodic literature and elements of postmodern fiction such as Barthes labyrinth, itself reaching back to Greek myth <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Dave Ciccoricco has pointed out, these kinds of narrative in fact implement a range of different  “networked”  narratives, from simple branching to more complex tree-like structures <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The genre has never quite broken through into widespread mainstream acceptance, but there has been a steady stream of innovation over the years and recent technological developments have prompted creative renewal. In 2005 the video game Façade illustrated the potential of generative AI narratives. In 2018 Netflix produced the interactive branching narrative show  <em>Bandersnatch</em>  (to mixed reviews) and the same year the live streamed show  <em>Artificial</em>  was released by Twitch, winning an Emmy for Innovation in Interactive Media.  <em>Artificial</em>  enabled direct interaction with the audience, including votes to fundamentally alter the plot and even remove characters, suggesting something of the potential of the new generation of technology. Charisma Entertainment are contributing to this same history of creative and technological development with charisma.AI, hoping for simultaneous breakthroughs in technological and creative development.</p>
<p>High quality academic critique is essential to this process. Interest in ludology (the study of games not only as cultural artefacts but as expressions of human identity and phenomenological experience) based on Johan Huizinga’s 1938 book  <em>Homo Ludens</em>   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> ground criticism of early multimedia products in a philosophically serious tradition and suggested that multimedia and transmedia products resist  “narrowly instrumental analysis”  and are properly conceived as both a foundational human experience and art <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, but criticism of electronic literature waned when narrative quality failed to attain the expected heights. The ideas that had been generated were enough to feed new modes of critical interpretation that remain relevant, however, including Donna Haraway’s articulation of a  “cyborg manifesto”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> and Katherine Hayles’ notion of  “intermediation”  that suggests an electronic text  “performs actions that bind together author and program, player and computer, into a complex system characterized by intermediating dynamics”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. The wider tradition can be usefully read through these critical lenses, and beyond to articulations of  “imagineering”  and immersion <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, and transhumanist <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> philosophies that emphasise the blending of human and machine. There is widespread acceptance that adding aesthetic experience to human-computer interaction heightens phenomenological entanglement.</p>
<p>The team at Charisma Entertainment were aware of the creative and critical tradition their charisma.AI platform was part of but they were primarily responding to the narrative potential inherent in emerging technologies. In the case of charisma.AI that related to character memory, and the ability of AI characters to remember and misremember information (such as a player’s name, but also narrative decisions and other aspects of gameplay) relayed to them by players. The charisma.AI system has been developed to connect with external services such as weather reports, via Application Programming Interfaces (API), and alter the gameplay accordingly (for example, mirroring the weather outside the player’s physical house in the virtual environment).</p>
<p>The  <em>For King and Country</em>  demo included additional challenging requirements, requiring the team to create several different kinds of character-to-audience conversations: one-on-one between players, ministers, and other heads of state (for example the American President); a version of a parliamentary debate where the player was part of conversations with several AI characters, and would need to influence them to vote in their favour; and multi-character, free-flowing conversational exchanges which would be very different to the one-on-one conversations from other charisma.AI projects. In one key speech, the player, acting as Prime Minister, tries to sway the AI characters to their point of view, creating a range of technical and creative challenges: in one scenario, for example, AI characters do not respond to the player’s speech if they have not interacted with them or have had negative interactions with them during the preceding narrative. It is worth noting that before the project started, charisma.AI’s natural language processing (NLP) could only parse short, declarative sentences, not the multiple sequential sentences that would be required for a convincing and compelling speech.</p>
<p>The creative implications of this narrative complexity were commented upon by writers attending the writer’s workshop at the start of the project. The group had a wide range of experience writing for the television and gaming industries (working on high profile productions including the BBC’s  <em>Sherlock</em>  series) but were struck by the cascading complexity that accrues from the ability of AI-enabled characters to remember and – more problematically – to strategically misremember information. To simplify the problem, the workshop participants thought through the implications of a character in a basic whodunnit narrative being able to remember or misremember player information. When should the writer save a piece of information, and when should they release it (at a dinner party with everyone present, in a private exchange between two characters)? How would they write a narrative that included one thread where a character faithfully remembered a piece of information, but in other contexts duplicitously misremembered it? How could writers control the exponential layers of complexity generated by such scenarios, and how could a writing interface be designed to ensure writers could keep track of the various narrative permutations? The narrative complexity that could be facilitated by charisma.AI is significantly increased by the ability of the writers to define and assign moods to characters, which can act as additional narrative gateways to new scenarios: say the wrong thing or ignore an important character, and they could choose to misremember rather than remember information conveyed at an earlier stage in the narrative.</p>
<p>Revealingly, given the analysis about skills requirements that we will detail below, Hall’s role changed significantly as the project progressed. The lead writer for Parabolic Theatre was unable to contribute to the project as intended due to scheduling conflicts. Hall took over primary writing duties for the  <em>For King and Country</em>  demo, as well as designing new logical structures inside charisma.AI to adapt its workflow for use as a plugin inside Unity, while working with the Charisma Entertainment team on the demo’s game flow. He continued in these roles when the project’s focus moved to a new demo, an adaptation of John Wyndham’s  <em>The Kraken Wakes</em> . This evolving collaboration led to several meaningful outcomes: two functional showcase demos -  <em>For King and Country</em> , and  <em>The Kraken Wakes</em>  - were written by Hall. The deeper collaboration on the two demos created a test case for how a DH research software engineer (RSE) could be embedded within a commercial development team, providing both technical and creative input. The changing priorities and roles during the project provided an important test of institutional flexibility and a model for effective collaboration between higher education and the creative industries.</p>
<h2 id="section-ii-pure-versus-applied-research">Section II: Pure versus Applied Research</h2>
<p>Applying AI therefore raises interesting questions about the nature of applied DH research. The project was initiated in conversations between Charisma Entertainment and King’s College London but was oriented towards answering problems for the industry partner, rather than research questions developed independently in the university. This is, of course, the essence of applied research in the formal Science and Technology Studies (STS) sense of the term: industry partners (whether in the creative industries or other industrial sectors) seek out research teams who can help them navigate an impasse in their R&amp;D or product development process, and research questions are designed with the sole purpose of resolving that impasse. Research is applied to real world problems, to develop new products or services for the marketplace. The fact Charisma Entertainment operates in the creative marketplace is incidental to this more reductive point. In this telling, applied research is opposed to pure research, which originates in the laboratories and offices of researchers free from outside influence. Pure (or basic or fundamental) research aims to build theories or produce knowledge but often has no practical or clinical application: it represents research in the sense implied by the Oxford English Dictionary’s quotation of E. Grimeston tr. J. de Acosta in 1604:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether these two great gulphes do ioyne in any other part of the world, which was the enterprize of Fernando Magellan a Portugall gentleman, whose great courage and constancie in the research of this subject, and happy successe in the finding thereof, gave the name of etenall memory to this straight (O.E.D. Online).<br>
Pure research is designed to fill in empty space on the map of knowledge, not to resolve practical problems. In this definition of the term, digital humanists do not engage in nearly as much applied research as they might think. Technical effort generally aims to fill gaps in the map of knowledge, not to build new products and services or solve problems encountered in the corporate or government worlds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, as many readers will have surmised, the distinction established in STS between pure and applied research is anything but straight-forward. Indeed, as Zoe Nyssa <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> has pointed out, STS scholars have built a discipline out of exploring and ultimately collapsing the distinction, variously noting the rather fine semantic distinction between knowledge sought to fill in blank spaces on the map and knowledge sought to increase our ability to manipulate or intervene in the known world: the cultural and politically mediated <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> aspects of both modes of research, the inherently messy  “mangle”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> of researchers, tools and methods, or the way in which objects and humans involved in the research process can be conceived (famously, by Bruno Latour) as mere actants <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> in a continuous process. Simplistic binary conceptions of applied versus pure research collapse under even limited scrutiny: in theoretical terms, and as a way of understanding the research endeavour in all its complexity, it provides the flimsiest of foundations. The fact the OED entry does not make a distinction between the two modes is telling.</p>
<p>And yet the distinction retains utility in the context of the DH work described in this article. While it is undoubtedly necessary to collapse the pure versus applied distinction when exploring the epistemological and methodological depths of laboratory science and DH projects designed to advance knowledge, it remains conceptually useful in the context of projects designed to enable commercial sector partners. Perhaps controversially, the distinction also sheds light on the relationship between DH, neo-liberalism, and the corporate university, highlighting a nascent area of DH practice that is presumably even more controversial than the production of historical databases or use of machine learning algorithms <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>: if the use of digital tools by humanists in the service of general humanities scholarship is controversial, their use in the service of commercial profit must surely be doubly so.</p>
<p>It is important to note in this context that, rather than being merely arguably connected to the corporate university, applied DH (in the strict sense of applied research intended by STS scholars) reflects hard commercial relationships between universities and the commercial sector initiated by the United States Bayh-Dole Act (1980). Bayh-Dole has been identified as a watershed moment by historians of higher education, changing the social and economic contract between universities and funding agencies and allowing them to pursue intellectual ownership of an invention themselves instead of needing to assign it to the federal government. This opened the research environment to market conditions, incentivising universities to define and protect their intellectual property (IP) and monetise it through the development of commercial ventures. Other governments (notably the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand) watched with interest and, over time, increasingly oriented their policies to commercial concerns too. In simple terms, the Act was the legal instrument in America (and the model in many other countries) by which  “highly contentious”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> forms of neoliberalism were unleashed on the university sector. As Allington et al notoriously implied in 2016 DH, whether the community is comfortable with it or not, it is imbricated in this wider context <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="section-iii-the-creative-economy">Section III: The Creative Economy</h2>
<p>The Applying AI to Storytelling project occupied the intersection of these currents, as much as being a straight-forward DH project. Significant amounts of funding have been directed towards Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s  “triple helix”  in the United Kingdom, characteristic of a  “new social contract between the university and larger society”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and based on intensive knowledge transfer and co-production across the full spectrum of research, development, and production. Noting progressive changes in the orientation of universities to the private sector since the 1980s, Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s 1995 paper claimed that university-industry relations had  “become a laboratory for the conscious reshaping of…knowledge infrastructure”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> in a manner that was transforming  “the role of the state in academia, the role of corporations in innovation and of the university in the economy…”   <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. In the United Kingdom, research activities (often conceived as applied research) that encourage collaboration between academia, industry, and government reflect this larger international reorientation of knowledge production towards instrumentalist concerns.</p>
<p>And yet, the Applying AI project demonstrates why this activity is justifiable in academic and creative as well as purely commercial terms. As is shown below, the success of the project hinged on the proper functioning of an interdisciplinary team involving technical developers, businesspeople, academics, and creative writers. The contribution of the RSE developer and creative writer were particularly essential; their lack of progress or unavailability was enough to halt the entire production process. It is not so much that Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s triple helix pulls otherwise purely creative writers and academics into the commercial world, in other words, as it creates a new set of creative challenges that require inter-disciplinary approaches to resolve. Projects such as Applying AI allow those new approaches to be trialled, for the benefit of commercial and research partners alike, creating significant creative and intellectual insights as well as new career paths. It is unreasonable to assume that cross-sector co-creation unwittingly acts as a Trojan horse for capture and the warping of HE priorities.</p>
<p>This has unfortunately become a natural assumption in some areas of humanities and DH scholarship. It is difficult to be sure of the precise intellectual genealogy, but it appears to be built on methodological positions established in STS by scholars such as Knorr-Cetina, who view  “knowledge as practices - within structures, processes, and environments that make up specific epistemic settings”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. This created an excellent framework for holistic analysis of scientific and technological initiatives but negative perceptions of applied research built on such work too, culminating in the work of Sheila Slaughter who coined the term academic capitalism and suggested it exposes the  “neoliberal tendenc[y] to treat higher education policy as a subset of economic policy”   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Another strain of literature built directly on Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff’s 1995 paper, criticising its emphasis on linear modes of knowledge transfer that assumes the progressive evolution of concepts from R&amp;D to production without an allowance for iterative cycles, co-production, and failure. Many humanists find it difficult to see the possibility of creativity or intellectual freedom in such models.</p>
<p>The conversation is becoming increasingly nuanced, however. Carayannis and Campbell’s Mode 3 Innovation Ecosystem emphasizes more fluid interaction between participants, and what the authors refer to as  “a multi-layered, multi-modal, multi-nodal and multi-lateral system, encompassing mutually complementary and reinforcing innovation networks and knowledge clusters consisting of human and intellectual capital, shaped by social capital and underpinned by financial capital”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Revealingly, Carayannis and Campbell’s analysis adds a fourth aspect to the triple helix in the form of feedback from the public and media culture, in a complex  “fractal”  innovation system that is self-correcting and constantly evolving <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Sarah Atkinson and Helen Kennedy use the term ecosystem in a similar way, noting the early adopter role of London theatre companies in the production of Virtual Reality (VR) experiences <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. However conceived, STS research has made it abundantly clear that policy changes at national level and economic pressures at a global level since World War Two have resulted in fundamental changes to the operational context of academic research, creating opportunities for new modes of creative production and collaboration.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom this crystalized in 1997 in the policies of the New Labour government led by Prime Minister Tony Blair, which established a Creative Industries Task Force (CITF) within its newly established Department of Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS). This taskforce, and the resulting Creative Industries Mapping Document (CIMD), has been widely credited with establishing the modern notion of the creative industries in the UK and positioning it at the forefront of national and international efforts to extract economic value from cultural activity. As Terry Flew notes, the CIMD defined the creative industries as  “those activities which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have the potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. New Labour subsequently positioned the creative industries at the heart of national identity, using the  “then-new concept of convergence to argue that the future of arts and media in Britain lay in a transformation of dominant policy discourses towards a productive engagement with digital technologies, to develop new possibilities for the alignment of British creativity and intellectual capital with these new engines of economic growth”   <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Applying AI to Storytelling provides an excellent example of this new model of government/creative industry interaction, contributing to policy changes designed to enable economic and cultural clusters the government identified as key drivers of Carayannis and Campbell’s fractal innovation ecosystem. In a 2009 article the authors identified three different kinds of clusters of  “fractally connected”  organizations dependent upon rich cross-sector interactions and complex transfer and production of R&amp;D activity: geographic, sectoral, and knowledge clusters <sup id="fnref2:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. These clusters - often overlapping and almost always interacting in complex cross-functional configurations - include a  “pluralism of a diversity of agents, actors and organisations: universities, small and medium-sized enterprises and major corporations, arranged along the matrix of fluid and heterogeneous innovation networks”   <sup id="fnref3:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. They function as what military analysts might term force multipliers, aggregating diverse economic and methodological capabilities in either real-world or virtual configurations and creating the conditions for exponential levels of creative and technical innovation and economic growth.</p>
<p>The concept of clusters clearly resonated with UK policy makers, who are eager to ensure the continued competitive advantage of the country’s creative economy they feel has been  “changed beyond recognition”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> by internet-based technologies: a £100bn sector worth more than the automotive, aerospace, life sciences, oil and gas industries combined <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. The sector has grown at more than twice the rate of the wider economy since 2010 <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Significant funding streams were directed at creative clusters<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  in 2018, with £80m allocated to fund nine creative industries clusters across the country <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. In a clear signal that the country acknowledges the synergistic relationship between scholarly analysis and economic production, an associated Policy and Evidence Centre was funded to work out how to best measure and enable future initiatives. A further £33m was allocated to an Audiences of the Future programme designed to enable cross-sector R&amp;D resulting in virtual and augmented reality (XR) products <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Applying AI project was funded by a related Innovate UK scheme, similarly aimed at enhancing knowledge and skills transfer between elements of the triple helix <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. The Creative Clusters and Innovate UK programmes amount to an overt attempt to extend the United Kingdom’s competitive advantage in the creative industries, in support of a plethora of flagship institutions such as the BBC, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, the Tate Modern, the Royal Opera House and in the context of emerging technologies that at once threaten and promise to transform their potential and scope. Revealingly, Carayannis and Campbell’s Mode 3 model extends the innovation environment from these traditional organisations to myriad small, medium, and large technology start-ups alongside established vendors, freelance designers, and gaming studios. The complexity is overwhelming but forecast disruption caused by emerging technologies and a related skills shortage has prompted remarkably directed action <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="section-iv-production-models-for-immersive-engineering">Section IV: Production Models for Immersive Engineering</h2>
<p>Any robust analysis of Applying AI needs to take this policy context into account. The primary aim of the project was to enable the commercial goals of Charisma Entertainment, who were grappling with issues endemic to the creative industries, beset by increasingly complex design and engineering problems at the intersection of art and technology. Hall’s work with the charisma.AI platform reflects this challenge: his work took on recursive characteristics as he moved between the role of writer, developer, and product consultant. Working with an evolving technical product, he realised its support for branching narratives would not be able to support the complex plot and character developments required for  <em>For King and Country</em> . Using computational logic and working closely with the core development and creative teams at Charisma Entertainment, he surmised that the interface could be stretched to accommodate a more complex hub and spokes plot configuration. This made management of the various story nodes difficult, so he hacked together a basic external technical solution (something that could later be integrated into the main product) to keep track of the narrative.</p>
<p>High quality production models for immersive engineering need to account for this symbiotic relationship between creative artists and technologies, enabling creative collaborations between artists and machines <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. A 2018 UK report into production pipelines for immersive engineering noted companies were experiencing difficulties across the entire spectrum, from budgeting to managing small teams, consumer expectations, design, dynamic workflows, inadequate and fast evolving toolsets, and a lack of people with appropriate skills and experience <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. Stuart Whyte, Director of VR product development at Sony’s SIE London Studio, framed the issue in stark terms, noting that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[i]t’s so new. I think in traditional games we’ve taken many generations and iterations of designs, around control schemes, and so on. The challenge and excitement around VR is that it is a very new space and some of those designs and languages from other games just don’t work so well in this medium and yet there are alternate ways you can do it that are even better (Whyte cited in <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>).<br>
Charisma Entertainment experienced much the same pressures as other start-ups building products for the creative industries during the Applying AI project (tight budget, small team, competing demands) and their production pipeline was similarly challenged. Hard choices had to be made between additional R&amp;D or creative effort and technical investment, and the ultimate decision to transition from production of the  <em>For King and Country</em>  demo to  <em>The Kraken Wakes</em>  required resolution of complex business, technical, and creative issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a more granular level, tension between creative and technical expression in Applying AI was generated from the characters in the charisma.AI system being audience aware. This means that they could: react to the language, mood and conversations of the players; remember previous interactions with a player; access a knowledge base of that character’s interactions with other players; and use this data to provide responses tailored to the user (implicitly in the way a chatbot learns from interactions, and explicitly, in directly challenging users with their shared history e.g.,  “yesterday you said this.” ). While it might seem premature to read phenomenological significance into such interactions, even with the critical apparatus provided by critics such as Aarseth <sup id="fnref2:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and those that followed him, it is worth noting the deep ramifications of memory for our understanding of not only human experience, but the nature of intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI). As Gisela Bahr et al note,  “[h]uman long-term memory is [merely] an example of naturally occurring big data”   <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. As rudimentary as contemporary chatbot and AI technology currently may be, and as minuscule as contemporary computing storage is next to the exabyte capacity of the human brain, the underlying mechanisms at work - especially in use cases as fundamental to experience and identity as narrative - provide valuable insights into the boundaries between human and machine intelligence. The study of memory and forgetting, and its implications for next-generation computing systems that struggle to manage the vast quantities of data being funnelled into them, is just one example of the strangely synergistic tensions emerging between the creative industries and industry proper. Production models for immersive engineering are likely to offer practical applications in a range of industrial settings.</p>
<h2 id="section-v-knowledge-transfer-and-talent-pipelines">Section V: Knowledge Transfer and Talent Pipelines</h2>
<p>Production pipeline issues were not satisfactorily resolved by the Applying AI project, although that was a key focus of the grant application. Progress was made identifying issues, and acknowledging the complexity of issues in play, but the problem is a generational one. Hall’s hybrid role as technical consultant and writer greatly increased the technical and creative capacity of the charisma.AI platform but was unsatisfactory as a long-term solution. Demand for hybrid talent is strong enough that Hall became unavailable for future phases of the project, and the Applying AI project made no provision for passing his skills on to another RSE. That issue was, of course, intractable in the short time available for the project. Hall’s skills have been developed over the course of more than a decade working as an RSE in digital humanities and creative writing.</p>
<p>Developing workers with Hall&rsquo;s blend of technical and creative skill is something that would ideally begin at primary and secondary school and be laced throughout university experience as well. It may be that practical masters, doctoral and post-doctoral fellowships will help in the interim, perhaps augmented by more vocationally focused apprenticeships and on the job mentoring, but they will need to be extremely flexible in their capacity to foster people with diverse talents expressed with different emphasises on different areas. Hall’s balance between technical and creative knowledge was useful but in many cases an inflection towards one or the other would be optimal. It is unusual to find someone with equal parts creative and technical talent, and more feasible to provide people with the skills they need to contribute to multi-disciplinary teams. Similarly, it will often be useful to involve people with theoretical academic knowledge as well: perhaps possessing barely enough technical knowledge to work closely with engineering teams but deep understanding of the creative and theoretical aspects to a problem.</p>
<p>An emphasis on teamwork skills, and confidence working across disciplinary boundaries will resolve many issues — accepting the need for hybrid teams as well as people with rare hybrid skills — but this will not resolve the deeper issues of narrative and aesthetic quality demanded by next-generation creative products. At some point the education system will need to adapt to the challenging requirements imposed by the creative industries and develop graduates with myriad indefinable mixtures of talent, fusing computational and creative skills along tailored learning pathways. The transfer of knowledge between university research teams and the creative industries is in this sense merely the first act in a wider process of a humanistic re-tooling of (a growing part of) the engineering profession. The development of robust talent pipelines from the education system into the creative industries should be the medium-term goal.</p>
<p>Applying AI to Storytelling was an ambitious and complicated interdisciplinary project undertaken in the context of a complex intellectual, creative, technical, and policy development landscape. The United Kingdom’s cognizance of the difficulties (and potential economic benefit) in the development of next-generation immersive products, and their proactive funding of applied research activity between academic and commercial partners, made it possible to engage in the relatively high-risk R&amp;D necessary to make progress but significantly more work is needed. A full-spectrum approach is needed to understand the implications of immersive product development in applied and theoretical terms. The goal must be to enable development of more sophisticated products (dare we hope, on a par with the centuries of tradition inherited by the creative industries), enabled by interdisciplinary academic enquiry, improved design and engineering processes, more effective pedagogical approaches, and enhanced career pipelines. The humanities, and DH in particular, are well positioned to contribute to this process but experimentation will need to occur across many concurrent areas of activity, and we will — in order to work at the cutting edge of creative endeavour and have a voice in the development of next-generation creative products — need to reconcile ourselves to contributing to commercially driven endeavours.</p>

<p><em>Data Feminism</em>   brings an intersectional feminist approach to any task having to do with data. Collecting, analyzing, creating datasets and later algorithms – it rightfully questions them all. The introduction provides readers with the logic behind why we need an intersectional feminist approach to data science and what the term offered by the authors, data feminism, means. Immediately explaining their approach in the Introduction,   <em>Data Feminism</em>    ““is a book about power in data science. Because feminism, ultimately, is about power too””   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The term feminism in the title is demystified upfront as well: the authors believe that   <em>Data Feminism</em>    “isn’t only about women … it isn’t only for women … it isn’t only about gender either. Feminism is about power – who has it and who doesn’t.”   <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.   <em>Data Feminism</em>   uses feminism as a tool and critical thinking method to look at communities who have long benefited from data and those who were pushed out to margins by it.</p>
<p>The book offers a list of seven comprehensive acts to prompt data activism. To make Data Feminism possible, the authors provide seven main principles – examining the power, challenging it, elevating emotion and embodiment, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and eventually making labor visible – and go through them in each of the seven chapters.   <em>Data Feminism</em> , both as a book and now as a hopefully known term, is the best example of bridging the theory-work produced in academia with the outside world in a real-life setting. It calls for tangible action and not merely reflection from our minds and classrooms to policymakers and data policies. The book is neither an answer to data injustices nor an explanation of data ethics; it is a step-by-step guide to employing the reader’s logic for forming better questions while moving ahead for a more just society because  “None of us are free if some of us are not”   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> as the authors put it well.</p>
<h2 id="seven-principles">Seven Principles</h2>
<p>The first chapter’s core idea is the exclusion of some communities caused by the  privilege hazard, meaning ignorance of being on top. While the chapter is grounded around the concept of the matrix of domination  originally offered by Patricia Collins, with the main aim to identify and   <strong>examine the power</strong> , it explains how data are extracted by dominant groups of people and mostly extracted from others. The authors find it crucial to understand how systems of oppression work with data as one main ingredient before taking the next step,   <strong>challenging the power</strong> . </p>
<p>In the second chapter, the language employed to address the questions of ethics and values when discussing data and supporting algorithms is analyzed to reform those discussions. Imagined objectivity and concepts that uphold it are compared and contradicted with real objectivity and intersectional feminist concepts that strengthen it. The authors argue that the first  “locates the source of the problem in individuals or technical systems”   while the latter   “acknowledges structural power differentials and works toward dismantling them”    <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. For both, a terms table that distinguishes the two objectivities: ethics vs. justice, bias vs. oppression, fairness vs. equity, accountability vs. co-liberation, and transparency vs. reflexivity is offered to equip their readers with better terms.</p>
<p>The third chapter, a favorite, challenges the possibility of pure objectivity and neutrality of data visualization in order to   <strong>elevate emotion and embodiment</strong> . It attempts to remind readers of the partiality of knowledge, drawing from Sandra Harding and Donna Haraway’s  “god trick” <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. It argues that demonstrating uncertainty in data visualizations is feasible but still hard for people to understand. Therefore, regardless of how hard data graphics try to stay neutral and rational, individuals recognize them differently. One excellent and straightforward example is shown in weather forecasts and how the phrase There is a 30% chance of rain tomorrow can be interpreted in various ways by the public to mean It will rain 30% of the time or It will rain in 30% of my area  <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. On the other hand, it is discussed that devaluing emotion and affect and centering rationality as the authoritative mode of communication in reading data visualization might tell us about   “who and what the system is trying to exclude”    <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. By assuming that rationality is assigned to male bodies and emotion to female bodies, the chapter criticizes the gendered binary of normative / derivative assigned to male bodies / female bodies.</p>
<p>As the fourth chapter quotes from Joni Seager,  “What gets counted counts,”  and it stands for   <strong>rethinking binaries and hierarchies</strong> . Classification of knowledge and constructed social categories used in science are introduced as other tools of power in data science. The Seager principle explains how binaries and constructed categories are the product of cultural and historical sets of values and biases of societies, and are therefore not only unreliable but also different from one society or community to another. Such binaries and classification systems are not extensible and need to be questioned and reconsidered. The peril lies where binaries are translated to codes and then encoded to technical systems. Such technical systems use data and datasets gathered and processed in the mentioned categories as input, process them into deliverable social policies or decisions, and perform them on human bodies and individuals. The authors invite readers to think of categories that, if left unquestioned, might be reductive, incomplete, or exclusive, and so too the policies and their deliverables.</p>
<p>Seeking multiple perspectives, the fifth principle and chapter,   <strong>embracing pluralism</strong> , takes up the fourth chapter’s argument with the same concern of the possible exclusion of local, Indigenous, or experiential ways of knowing. Through stories of projects such as the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project and the EJ Atlas, the chapter shows how not leaving the data work entirely to the ones who are aliens to the subject of a project – assuming that their neutrality in relation to the subject of the project is the only necessity – can be beneficial. Employing the communities, including marginalized ways of thoughts, and making the process more pluralistic by   “synthesizing multiple perspectives”    <sup id="fnref3:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> can direct data projects toward more co-liberated models of data. Intending to make data models that promote co-liberation  rather than  accountability (terms that were counterposed with each other and discussed in the second chapter) is another way of feminist-thinking-through-data-work that makes Data Feminism possible. </p>
<p>The sixth chapter discusses one of the most critical and challenging principles:   <strong>considering context</strong> . The authors discuss how numbers, or raw data, are alone not enough to show results in works of research that have to deal with humans. They offer that  “raw data”  are, in fact, already  “cooked”  in previous systems of bias or exclusion before becoming a number or data because they are obtained from people, regardless of the context in which the datasets were produced. Considering, acknowledging, and naming the systems of oppression at work is essential when talking about numbers, as   “they do not speak for themselves”   <sup id="fnref4:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The authors show through various examples how a simple bar label and caption can point out context and make a difference in how it will be comprehended. Although tricky, a feminist approach can be taken to interpret or, in other words, speak for the numbers in different projects.  “Letting the numbers speak for themselves”  is viewed as unethical and undemocratic, with the potential to do more harm than good by reinforcing the unjust status quo <sup id="fnref5:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Reminiscently, if nothing else, Data Feminism is a valuable project that by itself starts practicing the seventh principle of   <strong>making the labor visible</strong> . If read between the lines, the authors leave to the audience two valuable lists as proof: first, a list of activists and scholars who are members of previously colonized nations, LGBTQIA+ and Indigenous communities and people of color, and second, a list of corporations and projects led by people of color.  “Nearly two-thirds of their citations are from women or non-binary people; almost every chapter has a project from the Global South; a third of all citations are from people of color, and nearly half of all projects mentioned in the book are led by people of color”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="_data_--for-everyone"><em>Data</em>  for Everyone</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that the consistency of their chain of thoughts and the logic that accompanies it are best presented in the threads of real-world well-researched stories. D’Ignazio and Klein master the art of storytelling in their scholarship by sublimely taking the readers’ hands and walking them through one question to another. Each question begins with a story and slowly leads the readers to the following question, then the story leaves the readers for another story. Questions and stories, with a touch of the desire to discover a part of the truth behind data industry and its history, take the reader line by line and chapter by chapter with an excellent suspension element to find the complete picture of the main idea. D’Ignazio and Klein are not the first people who point out intersectionality, data ethics, or the history of colonialism, sexism, or racism, but they are some of the very few who treat them all as simple layers patiently and gradually added to a body of knowledge, forming an understandable array of new settings and concepts. As examples they define the matrix of domination  in the first chapter and  auditing the algorithms  in the second chapter.</p>
<p>Among the readers’ comments and reviews online from across the world, there is one question everybody asks, and many try to answer: who is this book   <em>for</em> ? A variety of answers have been given: teachers, sociology classes, or feminists in the digital age who work with data <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. I firmly believe that this book is for   <em>everyone</em> , and maybe that is why it offers such a consistent, easy-to-read, and easy-to-follow language. For scholars, teachers, or students in the humanities or social sciences, its main ideas raised on the intersectionality of race and sex might not be new. However, actively engaging with the book and considering teaching it in undergraduate or master’s courses is suggested because of its valuable and essential intersection of theory with the most powerful asset of today: data.</p>
<p>For data scientists, engineers, managers, or anyone  <em>in</em>  the tech world or directly working with data,   <em>Data Feminism</em>   is an essential read. Not requiring the ability to read wordy, slowly-nuanced essays typical to the humanities, this book will neither disappoint experts in corporations nor confuse them. The book is full of straightforward anecdotes about tech companies and projects, both governmental and voluntary, big and small, that are good or bad examples of practicing what the authors call  data justice. Important thematic and primary questions are raised by the authors and formerly by intersectional feminists such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, and others. Indeed this book will make readers ask the basic   <em>wh-</em>   questions,  “data science for whom?, data science by whom?,”  and   “data science with whose interests and goals?”    <sup id="fnref6:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. </p>
<p>For the ones who neither work with data nor the humanities, it is still worth the read because of the very simple fact that data surrounds everybody, or it will sooner or later in life no matter where people live – if it hypothetically has not yet. It gives readers invaluable insight into the social and data structure of the present world: how an individual is, or sometimes is not, being counted, what individuals count and sometimes do not, how an individual is being [mis]presented, and how the world around is being modeled, displayed and shown to them. It makes the reader think twice or more critically about   “god tricks” <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  or the  facts  one has already accepted as their lifetime  assumptions.</p>
<p>Out of the scope of this book, the authors seemingly continue the work while engaging other scholars. There is a workspace on Slack with more than 300 members from all over the world, on which anyone can share ideas, news, articles, tweets related to the data economy   “to nurture the imagination of what an equitable data economy might look like”    <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The battle to unlock the invisible black boxes of data and biases, and fight against their effects has begun and it calls for active contributions and a great deal of critical thinking for everyone.</p>

<p>The question that has been at the heart of minimal computing —  “What do we need?”  — may never quite land the same way again.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  The summer of 2020 found librarians asking researchers about books they needed to access, department chairs surveying faculty for their remote teaching needs, undergraduate students sharing leads on summer work after paid internships were cancelled, and graduate students turning CVs into resumes as the remains of the academic job market all but evaporated. As I write this, academics continue to hash out detailed scenario plans at universities whose fates seem to change by the day. But these approaches to what we need in academia, these finer-grained tactics and forms of exchange, have only now become possible to imagine. Not long ago, we found ourselves asking even more fundamental versions of the question: What do we need in order to communicate, to eat, to stay healthy, to keep communities intact?</p>
<p>The same pandemic has affected everyone in remarkably different ways. But no one will soon forget the feeling of preparing in March 2020 for a crisis whose shape seemed to evolve in real time. I remember standing with my partner in a grocery aisle, wondering whether microwaveable or stovetop rice would be a safer bet if infrastructure maintainers could no longer report to work. Which utilities would last longer: electricity (delivered here in Philadelphia by a private company) or gas (a municipal utility)? The next day, I tried to reassure myself that it was just paranoia that led me to download PDFs of grocery checklists and CDC preparedness guides in case our Internet connection also went down.  “Who knew what was true,”  says the protagonist of  <em>Severance</em>  (2018), Ling Ma’s uncannily timed novel of pandemic survival in New York City:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sheer density of information and misinformation at the End, encapsulated in news articles and message-board theories and clickbait traps that had propagated hysterically through retweets and shares, had effectively rendered us more ignorant, more helpless, more innocent in our stupidity. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actuality of what communities experienced in the following months — checking on neighbors, refreshing news feeds, delivering groceries, shuffling endless Zoom calls — was nothing like the dystopian imaginaries that led us to go with the stovetop rice over the microwaveable. (Didn’t Snake Plissken cook over an open fire in  <em>Escape from New York?</em> ) Nor did it make the growing number of doomsday prepper billionaires — whose minds apparently always work this way — look any less silly <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. As Laurie Penny writes on these techno-libertarians, who for years have been buying underground bunkers, bullets, and meals ready to eat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shit-hits-the-fan escapism — a big part of the alt-right imaginary — never predicted this. I have lurked in countless stagnant ideological Internet back alleys where young men excitedly talk about the coming end of civilization, where men can be real men again, and women will need protectors. How inconvenient, then, that when this world-inverting crisis finally showed up, we weren’t given an enemy we could fight with our hands (wash your hands). <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, the past two years have crystallized the meaning of asking  “What do we need?”  both as individuals and as communities, demonstrating how the question surfaces issues of connection, solidarity, and belonging (Who are we?) as well as different orders of value (Which needs get prioritized?). Countless forms of communal response to this crisis have quickly overshadowed the individualistic, doomsday prepper imaginary.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Proponents of minimal computing have placed  “What do we need?”  at the center of digital humanities practice, beginning with the formation of the Global Outlook::DH Minimal Computing Working Group in 2014. In a field often tempted by the discourse of innovation, minimal computing instead has pushed digital humanities conversations toward issues of technology access, participation, sustainability, stewardship, and equity. In  <em>New Digital Worlds</em> , Roopika Risam describes minimal computing as  “a range of cultural practices that privilege making do with available materials to engage in creative problem-solving and innovation. These go by names like  <em>jugaad</em>  in India,  <em>gambiarra</em>  in Brazil,  <em>rebusque</em>  in Colombia,  <em>jus kali</em>  in Kenya, and  <em>zizhu chuangxin</em>  in China”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Risam shows that by foregrounding cultural practices rather than tools or platforms, minimal computing prioritizes a humanist approach to technology, including questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to repurpose existing technologies to reduce e-waste and engage with obsolescence in generative ways; how to conceptualize the difference between choosing to engage with minimal computing principles and doing so out of necessity; and how to examine the social impacts of computing through postcolonial lenses. <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judging from the range of contributions to this issue of  <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> , humanists have experimented with many permutations of digital methods and media theory to explore these questions over the past eight years.</p>
<p>But the idea that I can’t shake — and the place I began when first proposing this essay — is that minimal computing often bumps up against problematic echoes of constraint, disaster, and isolation that circulate in far more public contexts than digital humanities discourse is capable of reaching. Some of these echoes can be found among groups animated by imaginaries of collapse, like the aforementioned disaster preppers and a recent subgenre of speculative fiction known as  “solarpunk,”  committed to far more generative stories of  “ingenuity, generatively, independence, and community”  in the face of climate change <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Meanwhile, self-described digital minimalists promote screen detoxes, mindfulness retreats, and tech fixes to reclaim control of our attention, ultimately advancing an asocial imaginary of disconnection and withdrawal. To cite the title of a recent documentary film,  “offline is the new luxury”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Still, other echoes can be found in movements that I see running in parallel to minimal computing, grassroots movements that bear important lessons for our academic conversations. This includes community technology organizations working to ensure digital equity in U.S. cities that still, in 2022, see less than fifty percent of residents in some areas connected to broadband. And it includes proponents of a decentralized web in response to the advance of data surveillance and tech industry overreach.</p>
<p>But the imagination of constraint that generated solarpunk stories of climate resilience is not at all the same one that produced an injunction to limit screen time and reclaim attention. Nor are the arguments for living out a doomsday scenario in an off-the-grid, independent bunker commensurate with arguments for a decentralized, interdependent network topology. And yet all of these discourses are animated by competing visions of minimalism as a virtue. Across the political spectrum, the idea is in the air.</p>
<p>How ironic then, that maximal digital connection is all that has kept and will keep so many going during this epoch of social distancing, as every happy hour and routine healthcare appointment, every first date and kindergarten class moved online. It’s far too early to describe this shift accurately, but even in the thick of things it’s clear that the pandemic has shuffled all previously settled distinctions between on- and offline, distance and proximity, connection and touch. What becomes of minimal computing now that we have seen the vital importance of maximal connection? Do arguments for minimalism still hold in a socially-distant, unevenly-connected U.S., let alone around the world? In order to take some steps toward an answer, I want to understand the problematic echoes that have informed the practice and reception of minimal computing. At the same time, I’d like to outline some of the emergent ways that I see minimal computing growing in this new world.</p>
<h2 id="community-technology-and-mesh-networks">Community Technology and Mesh Networks</h2>
<p>In the context of COVID-19, asking  “What do we need”  depends largely on the we in question. For Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) in the U.S., the pandemic has exacerbated inequities that have plagued their communities for centuries. As Stacey Patton put it,  “The pathology of American racism is making the pathology of the coronavirus worse.”  Higher rates of incarceration, homelessness, chronic medical conditions, and a lack of access to quality health care all leave Black Americans  “more vulnerable to increased viral transmission, infection and death during a pandemic”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  The disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 are seen not only in health outcomes, but also in employment — the unemployment rate for Black people rose in May 2020 while the employment rate for white people rebounded — as well as in digital inclusion. When schools closed at the beginning of the pandemic, roughly half of Philadelphia’s K-12 students lacked an Internet connection at home, rendering the Chromebook laptop lending program offered by the school district useless <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  And according to a March 2020 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, 80% of White residents had broadband subscriptions, compared to only 53% of Black and 44% of Latinx residents in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington metropolitan area <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Internet accessibility in Philadelphia corresponds so closely with race that a map of broadband connection rates by neighborhood is essentially identical to a map of the city’s whitest neighborhoods.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Philadelphia is not unique among U.S. cities in this regard. When every classroom and doctor’s office moved online, when bearing witness to violence and injustice on the Internet became a matter of life and death, the twinned crises of global pandemic and state-sponsored, racist violence, symbolized by the murder of George Floyd, foregrounded the urgency of finally addressing digital inclusion in the U.S., almost a decade after the United Nations declared Internet access a fundamental human right <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. But in the absence of a competent policy response at either the federal or local levels in the U.S., communities have devised various forms of making do to fill the gaps. During the summer of 2020, across the country, groups organized to build networked computing infrastructures from scratch, using various combinations of hardware, software, policy stopgaps, community ownership, and cooperative decision-making <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>
<p>These projects center on the development of mesh networks. Greta Byrum, Co-Director of the Digital Equity Laboratory at The New School, explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of requiring a centralized hub to direct network traffic, a mesh operating system automatically searches for the best path for data to travel. Devices (even computers or phones) can become nodes or connecting points that enable data to hop from place to place until it reaches its destination. If a node fails or breaks, the network automatically routes around it through other nodes.<br>
<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> <br>
In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, many groups have been using community-owned and operated mesh networks to share a single Internet connection among a broader group of users with comparatively little cost required.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  In New York, Community Tech NY developed DIY instructions for making their Portable Network Kit at home, as the in-person workshops they led for years became impossible.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  In Baltimore, the Digital Harbor Foundation and Project WAVES worked with the public schools to daisy-chain the schools’ Internet backbone to neighboring homes with mesh radios <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. And in several cities along the East Coast, bookmobiles, ice cream trucks, and satellite vans were repurposed as mobile WiFi hotspots resembling the 1970s Stanford Research Institute Packet Radio Vans: the first example of mobile networking. The Kingston Equitable Internet Initiative also expanded their network with one of these vehicles.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the  “cultural practices . . . with available materials”  detailed in Risam’s description of minimal computing, community technology involves the construction, maintenance, and care of technical and community infrastructures alike <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Many of these mesh groups have learned from the foundational training curricula developed by the Detroit Community Technology Project, founded by Diana Nucera, who defines community technology as,  “A principled approach to technology that is grounded in the struggle for a more just digital ecosystem, placing value on equity, participation, common ownership and sustainability”   <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. From the perspective of community technology, building mesh networks means not only maintaining the codebase and buildout, but also  “fostering relationships of trust and cooperation among neighbors, who must work together to make decisions about network design, services, access protocols, security, and long-term sustainability”   <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Rather than parachuting in shiny new hardware, mesh network groups and community technologists host participatory design workshops and technical trainings that empower communities to maintain and grow their network connections in relationships of care. As Hi‘ilei Julia Kawehipuaakahaopulani Hobart and Tamara Kneese write in their introduction to an important new issue of  <em>Social Text</em>  devoted to Radical Care, such forms of care have historically come to the fore<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>when institutions and infrastructures break down, fail, or neglect. Reciprocity and attentiveness to the inequitable dynamics that characterize our current social landscape represent the kind of care that can radically remake worlds that exceed those offered by the neoliberal or postneoliberal state, which has proved inadequate in its dispensation of care.<br>
<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><br>
Here in Philadelphia, these conversations flourished among a working group composed of community organizers, technologists, academics, public school teachers, and City Hall staffers who came together during the early months of the COVID-19 lockdown. This Philly Community Wireless (PCW) project has been learning from the efforts of mesh groups in other cities, as well as from the history of past community technology efforts in Philadelphia. These include Wireless Philadelphia, one of the country’s first municipal WiFi providers that unfortunately dissolved soon after it was formed in 2004; Prometheus, a collective that built and advocated for independent, low-power radio and other wireless technologies throughout the 2000s; and Philly Mesh, an experimenter group that worked toward interoperability with mesh networks in other cities in the mid-2010s <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing we have learned at PCW by centering our conversations on community technology is that not all approaches to minimalism are compatible. For example, two very distinct versions of minimalism have emerged in our survey of mesh projects around the country, as well as within our own conversations. In the first version, decentralized networks, non-proprietary hardware, and open source software are prized for their ability to build truly independent networks. A decentralized web (DWeb) could minimize reliance on exploitative Internet service providers looking to sell user data, as well as minimize the surveillance harms that disproportionately impact BIPOC communities. The second version of minimalism instead emphasizes inclusion and access, regardless of the tools used to achieve them. In this version, access to the Internet is viewed as a fundamental human right. The Alliance for Affordable Internet — a global coalition of organizations working to reduce cost barriers to Internet access — further specifies that baseline connectivity is not enough and instead emphasizes meaningful connectivity as the standard. Meaningful connectivity, according to their definition, involves the following four minimal thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular Internet use | minimum threshold: daily use</li>
<li>An appropriate device | minimum threshold: access to a smartphone</li>
<li>Enough data | minimum threshold: an unlimited broadband connection at home or a place of work or study</li>
<li>A fast connection | minimum threshold: 4G mobile connectivity <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These debates will continue to evolve alongside the mesh networking technologies that animate them. As Rory Solomon details, technologists have only recently developed the routing protocols that make mesh networks scalable, in which every radio sends and receives packets of information simultaneously, minimizing hops between nodes while avoiding interference between all of that delicately interwoven traffic <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  And so the kinds of political ideas emerging from mesh praxis — ideas about justice, equity, and privacy — will only become clearer as more communities in cities around the country begin to map their lines of sight and thread themselves together, node-by-node. It will be interesting to see whether the minimal thresholds of meaningful connectivity can be achieved through complex, experimental hardware, and whether that highly specialized hardware can be made responsive to community input and ownership.</p>
<p>For now, the problem is that the non-proprietary hardware prized by one crowd presents yet another barrier to access in the eyes of the other, who prefers tools that easily connect people right out-of-the-box. And so the pursuit of decentralization on the one hand and meaningful connectivity on the other is a tension that seems present in many mesh communities. But the debate plays out differently depending on its context. In some cases, one form of tech activism gradually transforms into another when arguments for network independence and racial justice are found to be complimentary. In others, a mesh group splinters and factions end up pursuing different goals. This outcome is more likely to be the case when the group’s membership consists largely of tech and telecom employees volunteering their time to build experimental infrastructures without much input from the community.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup></p>
<p>What do we need? Clearly, it depends.</p>
<h2 id="minimalism-as-austerity-chic">Minimalism as Austerity Chic</h2>
<p>Community technologists and advocates of the decentralized web each stake competing claims to minimalism: one draws attention to the minimal requirements necessary for human flourishing, while the other seeks to minimize the influence of corporations that extract profitable data from everyday life.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  Working with members of both groups over the past year, I’ve found myself wondering what the concept and practice of minimal computing might offer these evolving debates. Does minimal computing offer its own competing school of thought? Or is it more of an umbrella descriptor for these interrelated approaches to tech justice?<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup></p>
<p>At the moment, it’s difficult to say. Minimalism is an incredibly diffuse idea circulating in so many different contexts that it’s often tricky to parse the weight that minimal holds when someone says minimal computing. Today, minimalism is the guiding ethos for a surprising variety of pop cultural phenomena, spanning everything from belongings that spark joy to contemplative practice that increases mindfulness <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. A minimalism of paring back and throwing things away can be found on Instagram and Pinterest: in mid-century modern furniture and lone potted plants against clean white subway tile backdrops, in sans serif fonts on bright, monochrome backgrounds with slogans reading  “Own less stuff. Find more purpose”  and  “The more you throw away, the more you’ll find.”   <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  But this aestheticized minimalism — a choice to pare back made by people who have everything they need — is a stark departure from the minimalism of necessity highlighted by practitioners of minimal computing. Taking a broader view of minimalism registers several problematic echoes of minimal computing among digital detoxers and disaster survivalists in intensities ranging from Luddism to asceticism. Attention needs to be given to these echoes, especially when valorizing DIY infrastructures built out of necessity by Indigenous, poor, or coastal communities and out of privilege by doomsday preppers.</p>
<p>Minimalism was originally the name for an avant garde movement in 1960s art that foregrounded the relationship between an art object and its museum viewer. With techniques like prioritizing shape and scale over representation, artists associated with minimalism sought to project little more than objecthood from their sculptures and paintings.  “What is at stake . . . is whether the paintings or objects in question are experienced as paintings or as objects,”  wrote Michael Fried, who preferred the term literalist to describe these conceptual works, in 1967.  “Like the shape of the object, the materials do not represent, signify, or allude to anything: they are what they are and nothing more”   <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. In the case of a minimalist sculpture, brushed aluminum is just brushed aluminum. Think of Donald Judd’s repeating cubes of identical size, Anne Truitt’s pillars broken by contrasting bands of color, Dan Flavin’s sculptural arrangements of fluorescent light fixtures, and Richard Serra’s massive, curved steel structures. At first, critics and artists alike applied a variety of terms to these works: literalist, cool, ABC, receptive, primary. But eventually, minimalist stuck.</p>
<p>Critics writing about this cadre of 1960s artists emphasized the theatrical qualities of the museum goer’s experience in the presence of their works. The sculptor Robert Morris described  “one’s awareness of oneself existing in the same space as the work . . . as he [ <em>sic</em> ] apprehends the object from various positions and under varying conditions of light and spatial context”   <sup id="fnref1:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Minimalist sculptures tend to be either massive or scaled to the size of the human body. When massive, viewers have to back up and circle around the sculptures, participating in space and time as they take in the objects from multiple angles. When they are anthropomorphically scaled, like Tony Smith’s six-by-six-by-six foot cube  <em>Die</em> , the sculptures possess an eerie presence: coming across one in an empty room feels like being surprised by someone you didn’t expect to be there.</p>
<p>If minimalist art amounted to  “a new genre of theater,”  as Fried wrote, it was a profoundly atomizing form of theater in which the viewer is confronted, distanced, and isolated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That the beholder is confronted by literalist work within a situation that he [ <em>sic</em> ] experiences as his means that there is an important sense in which the work in question exists for him alone, even if he is not actually alone with the work at the time. . . . Someone has merely to enter the room in which a literalist work has been placed to become that beholder, that audience of one — almost as though the work in question has been waiting for him. <sup id="fnref2:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This asocial theatricality couldn’t be farther from the communal experience of theater that Bertolt Brecht or Antonin Artaud advocated for, a theater that transformed its heterogeneous audience into a collective whole. For Michael Fried, if minimalism is a form of theater, it only admits an audience of one.</p>
<p>The ubiquity of minimalist sensibilities today makes a lot more sense when seen in light of its roots in this 1960s conceptual art movement, with its sculptures that provoked atomization and isolation. For Kyle Chayka, minimalism today is  “an inevitable societal and cultural shift responding to the experience of living through the 2000s,”  from the impossibility of owning a home and paying down debt to the vanishing likelihood of ever being paid a fair wage in a job that is secure. During a time when crises fade only as the next one begins,  “flexibility and mobility now feel safer than being static, another reason that owning less looks more and more attractive. . . . It makes sense that millennials embrace minimalism. My generation has never had a healthy relationship with material stability”   <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup></p>
<p>The architect Pier Vittorio Aureli is less charitable in his description of minimalism as a form of austerity chic. In  <em>Less is Enough</em> , Aureli argues that the endless romanticization of minimalism in the 21st century is the result of the inhumane demands that capitalism has made of people since the industrial age:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the history of capitalism, less is more defines the advantages of reducing the costs of production. Capitalists have always tried to obtain  <em>more</em>  with  <em>less</em> . Capitalism is not just a process of accumulation but also, and especially, the incessant optimisation of the productive process towards a situation in which  <em>less</em>  capital investment equals more capital accumulation. Technological innovation has always been driven by the imperative to reduce the costs of production, the need for wage earners. The very notion of  <em>industry</em>  is based on this idea: to be  <em>industrious</em>  means being able to obtain the best results with fewer means. <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because capitalism constantly demands that we do more with less, minimalism could serve as an invitation to ask why: why we should be content with austerity, where this injunction comes from, and what might be possible with more. Unfortunately, minimalism is instead broadly seen as a self-apparent virtue, a celebration of isolated individuals paring back the boundaries of their otherwise shared experiences.</p>
<h2 id="from-digital-minimalism-to-digital-equity">From Digital Minimalism to Digital Equity</h2>
<p>Digital minimalism has recently emerged as an offshoot of the broader minimalist imaginary in order to cope with ever-intensifying forms of precarity that affect our ability to maintain not just livable wages, but also uninterrupted trains of thought. Digital minimalists seek to reinforce the permeable membrane of their attention through mindfulness exercises, software settings, productivity apps, and other forms of tech fixes. Approaches in this area fall into a few different categories. First are the books that seek to identify and change the habits that lead users to constantly seek refuge in their phones. Proponents in this camp offer prompts like spend time alone and hold conversation hours.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  A related group consists of tech industry employees and insiders who have seen the light and devoted themselves to fixing the social harms their algorithms have created. Former Google engineer Tristan Harris, for example, founded the nonprofit Center for Humane Technology to draw attention to the ways recommendation algorithms manipulate our cognitive biases in order to keep us scrolling. The group has begun a laudable campaign that pressures tech companies to pivot from business models built on cognitive exploitation by  “creat[ing] market conditions for humane tech,”  albeit without a real road map for doing so <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A second category tries to solve surveillance capitalism with tech fixes. For their part, tech companies now allow users to seemingly calibrate their attention through options recently added to the system preferences of all major mobile platforms. These features are known as Digital Wellbeing in Android, Screen Time in iOS, and Zen Mode on OxygenOS. A digital minimalist might be further outfitted with gadgets like IRL Glasses with polarized lenses that block the images on screens and slabs of solid plastic called NoPhones that act as pacifiers for smartphone addicts. Digital minimalists can also choose from the Google Paper Phone, a paper printout folded like a zine containing all of the information you’ll need for the day and the Light Phone, an app-less device with an e-ink display that only calls and texts. If minimalism has become synonymous with the capitalist injunction to do more with less, it also promises that buying more will allow us to do less.</p>
<p>A third group of digital minimalists draws from the medicalized discourse of screen detoxes and tech fixes used by both groups above. But they go one step further by attributing the 21st-century crisis of attention not only to overreach by the tech industry and its powerful algorithms but also to a certain moral failure on the part of users. Public philosophers James Williams and Matthew Crawford both describe attention as a battleground for human agency. And both seem almost nostalgic for an earlier era when humanity could rely on an  “off-the-shelf package of religious and cultural constraints”  to regulate our attention, agency, and values <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. Williams writes,  “In the twentieth century the rise of secularism and modernism in the West occasioned the collapse — if not the jettisoning — of many of these off-the-shelf packages of constraints in the cause of the liberation of the individual.”  Users of digital devices are now faced with  “the self-regulatory cost of bringing your own boundaries”  to attention <sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  For Crawford,  “The left’s project of liberation led us to dismantle inherited cultural jigs that once imposed a certain coherence (for better and worse) on individual lives”   <sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  Both writers retreat into the Western philosophical canon for guidance amid our present  “vacuum of cultural authority”   <sup id="fnref2:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Digital minimalism has emerged at a moment when the tech industry continues to invent new methods for transforming our habits and desires into profitable data. But most researchers understand this transformation not in terms of the absence of religion, but the presence of capitalism. These are the terms that Soshana Zuboff has persuasively developed in her work on  “surveillance capitalism”   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. Others describe the tech industry’s co-opting of our everyday behavior into new forms of value as a colonial process. Nick Couldry and Ulises A. Mejias see this digital extraction as an expansion of the ways colonialism has appropriated human life for centuries:  “Colonialism’s sites of exploitation today include the very same West that historically imposed colonialism on the rest of the world. . . . What if the armory of colonialism is expanding? What if new ways of appropriating human life, and the freedoms on which it depends, are emerging?”   <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. Unfortunately, the self-help nature of digital minimalism is disconnected from a broader accounting of the tech industry’s collective, social impacts. Instead, much like the isolated, atomized viewer of a minimalist sculpture, digital minimalists emphasize the sanctity of an idealized, individual human experience without ever thinking to address the stratification of those experiences.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup></p>
<p>While some manuals are better conceptualized than others — especially Jenny Odell’s wonderful  <em>How to Do Nothing</em> , in many ways a parody of the genre <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> — digital minimalism is largely an argument against technology that forecloses collective action. Digital minimalists often fashion themselves as 21st-century Luddites. But as Megan Ward has argued, Luddism was originally an economic argument, not a self-help motto or personal virtue:  “Refusing to be ceaselessly on-call may increasingly become the province of the wealthy and powerful, a return to an era when recreational time was a luxury of the elites rather than a social right for the masses”   <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  Unplugging or digitally detoxing doesn’t absolve us of any ethical entanglements at a time when gig workers don’t have the privilege to put their devices away, or when Black and Brown communities don’t have a say in whether they will be surveilled by facial recognition systems and disproportionately imprisoned by pretrial sentencing algorithms <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  Ruha Benjamin, who details these and other forms of digital inequity in  <em>Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code</em> , writes of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silicon Valley parents requiring nannies to sign no-phone contracts and opting to send their children to schools in which devices are banned or introduced slowly, in favor of  “pencils, paper, blackboards, and craft materials.”  All the while I attend education conferences around the country in which vendors fill massive expo halls to sell educators the latest products couched in a concern that all students deserve access — yet the most privileged  <em>refuse</em>  it? . . . Social theorist Karl Marx might call tech personalization our era’s opium of the masses and encourage us to just say no, though he might also point out that not everyone is in an equal position to refuse, owing to existing forms of stratification.<br>
<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> <br>
Read in this light,  “offline is the new luxury”  seems to be less a celebration of leisure and mindfulness than an accurate diagnosis of digital inequity <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, all these terms have been scrambled amid a pandemic, when broadband connectivity could mean the difference between going out of business and creating an online storefront, or going without healthcare and scheduling a virtual appointment. The writings of the digital minimalists seem almost quaint now that so much of social existence has become filtered through screens. For some time, maximal digital connection will be all we have. It’s difficult to say how much of this new maximalist sensibility will survive the pandemic. But it will be important to reframe the digital minimalist conversations of the 2010s for the demands of digital equity in the 2020s. Going forward, we should ask: which of these competing claims to minimalism — as a form of attention, mindfulness, and agency — are compatible with maximal connection, with maximal choice, with maximal investment in communities and infrastructures?</p>
<h2 id="minimal-computing-maximal-connection">Minimal Computing, Maximal Connection</h2>
<p>It’s almost impossible to talk about minimal computing without reference to these free-floating cultural imaginaries of minimalism as a solution to the problems of technology today, from doing more with less to surviving off the grid. Before we deploy minimal computing in digital humanities pedagogy and practice, these problematic echoes of minimal computing need to be examined. At a moment when minimalism in pop culture commodifies asceticism and romanticizes disconnection, practitioners of minimal computing should use the term carefully. When digital humanists use the phrase, what does minimal mean? And when we hold up minimalism as a virtue, is that virtue a property of particular tools or specific techniques for using them?</p>
<p>In 2014, Dennis Tenen and I published a tutorial that showed how academic writers could step outside  “proprietary word processing software and fragile file formats”  like Microsoft Word and Google Docs. The values guiding that piece included an emphasis on the fundamentals of computation, legibility of the many layers of mediation involved in word processing, and above all, sustainability of the media on which we record our ideas <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. The tools we used to achieve those goals are now closely associated with  “minimal computing” : markdown and the document conversion software Pandoc, as well as static site generators. But I now wonder whether we were prioritizing the values embedded in the tools (as do the proponents of a decentralized web who advance non-proprietary hardware) or the values that informed our selection and use of those tools (like the community technologists who advocate for meaningful connectivity for all). When it comes to Pandoc and static sites, do these artifacts have politics, as Langdon Winner famously asked? Can particular technologies have either inherently democratic or inherently authoritarian tendencies,  “embody[ing] specific forms of power and authority?”   <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The answer is of course a resounding yes. Pandoc prevents information from being endangered or locked into proprietary ecosystems, while static sites enable the democratization and rapid deployment of humanist praxis, which Alex Gil and Élika Ortega usefully describe as  “the renewal, dissemination, and preservation of the scholarly record”   <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. However, I would caution against an easy equivocation between tools and their attendant politics. Too often, digital humanists attribute democratic tendencies to some tools while overlooking the authoritarian tendencies of others. I’m thinking in particular about the number of digital humanities studies that use facial recognition technologies in studies of film and television without once mentioning the racist ways those tools are deployed in the world<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  — or work in cultural analytics that sidestep questions about machine learning’s amplification of existing inequities with the briefest of preambles before moving on to the value-neutral application of those tools.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  If we simply borrow a data science tool in the humanities and apply it to a corpus of photographs or novels without questioning the assumptions baked into that tool or the harmful ways that tool is deployed in the world today, that is a missed opportunity for dialogue and advocacy.</p>
<p>A better approach might be to invert Langdon Winner’s question, as Christina Dunbar-Hester does in her book  <em>Low Power to the People:</em>    “Do politics have artifacts?”  This is a much more difficult question, asking how we can identify which tools best exemplify a particular political argument. Dunbar-Hester’s book is an ethnography of community technologists working with radio and WiFi in the early 2000s who negotiated  “the construction and implementation of specific beliefs about what technology can do, what technology should do, or what artifact is most appropriate to enact a set of politics”   <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Winner explores the existence of  “artifactual politics,”  rightly concluding that all artifacts entail some form of political argument or effect. His approach to artifactual politics would describe minimal computing as an assemblage of particular tools and platforms — Jekyll, Hugo, Pandoc, Markdown — that afford a particular form of politics, an argument about the role of technology in daily life. Dunbar-Hester asks instead how to identify and describe  “political artifacts,”  or the artifacts that embody particular arguments. If the politics of minimal computing are access, participation, sustainability, and equity, then what tools are best suited to achieve those goals? The benefit of Dunbar-Hester’s approach is that there is never just one right answer, and it ensures that we lead with a fluid conversation about values rather than locking those values into the affordances of a particular tool.</p>
<p>For example, while the tools currently associated with minimal computing are more sustainable, they can be less equitable in terms of participation (considering the steep learning curve of starting from scratch) or bandwidth (given their pared back, lower-definition, lesser-than resources). Jentery Sayers warned of this early on, in 2016:  “It’s easy to become preoccupied with technical details and specialization, which often ostracize people or inhibit participation”   <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. Since then, minimal computing has become near synonymous with static sites in particular, but static sites are often at odds with some of minimal computing’s core values of access and participation. The Executive Council of the Association for Computers and the Humanities, for example, recently decided against migrating their website from WordPress to a static site generator due in part to learning-curve concerns. The Council worried that the command line, markdown, and Git may have presented too great a barrier to entry for new contributors to the site.<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>  While static site generators are remarkable tools — I’m a known fan — they have become too easily conflated with minimal computing. An artifactual politics approach has welded a value (rapid deployment) to a tool (static site generators) at the expense of sustainable community partnerships and equitable participation.</p>
<p>Values guiding the theory and practice of minimal computing include access, participation, sustainability, stewardship, and equity. When placed alongside each other — as we’ve seen — these values often produce rich contradictions that can be difficult to appreciate if particular tools elevate some values at the expense of others. I find that this has been especially difficult to remember during the pandemic, amid a rush to throw tools and platforms at every activity under the sun in a desperate attempt to recreate the way things felt before social distancing. But the contribution of minimal computing has always been the way it foregrounds — instead of particular tools — what Roopika Risam calls  “cultural practices,”  what German media theorists call Kulturtechniken, and what we can simply refer to here as technique, or the way we do things <sup id="fnref3:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. If minimal computing is to continue asking  “What do we need?”  in order to define the we in question and elevate the values held in common by that we, then it will have to find new ways to center its principles on the way we do things rather than the tools we use to do them. I offer three suggestions in closing for how to surface such techniques in the unsettled months and years to come.</p>
<p>First, minimal computing should be led by community input. For the community technologist, maximal connection doesn’t necessarily mean more tools. Instead, it means increased accountability, tangibility, and locality to the ways we connect with one another. In building social and technical infrastructures alongside one another, community technologists advocate not only for access, but also for the legibility of unseen, surveillant infrastructures. As Rory Solomon writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mesh networks are more like students passing notes in class. . . . Even though social media and meme culture are often referred to as peer-to-peer, they remain intermediated by vast agglomerations of actors — corporations, institutions, platforms, infrastructures, workers — that we don’t know and maybe can’t fully know or see. <sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Greta Byrum, mesh is  “a tool of resilience and mutual aid . . . a way to resist autocratic control of communications systems”   <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. As we’ve seen, minimalism is relative. But the version of minimal computing offered by community technologists is a minimalism of paring back to make visible, of participation and equity. At the same time, it is a minimalism that remains tool-agnostic and responsive to the values of a community. Community technology connects the individual user to her shared social bonds — and the impacts of technology on both — by advancing a form of minimalism that is rich with social connection.</p>
<p>Second, minimal computing should be responsive to the underlying contradictions and concerns that have inspired flawed responses to the tech industry like digital minimalism and disaster survivalism. Both of these ideas advocate for inward retreat and isolation. But their imaginaries of constraint also offer lessons for the future of minimal computing as it is practiced in digital humanities scholarship, pedagogy, and praxis. Clearly, the romance with the tech industry is over and the public is hungry for new ways to think about the role of invasive technologies in daily life. And so minimal computing should incorporate the bare minimum literacies needed today in order to understand what data is captured about our habits and desires, as well as the impacts that collection will have. It should also incorporate tactics for data literacy and the obfuscation of surveillance (also known as sousveillance), instead of retreats into mindfulness.<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>  Minimal computing can offer self-determination rather than self-help, an ethics of connection rather than an injunction to detox, and forms of solidarity rather than appropriation.</p>
<p>And finally, given this broad hunger for more responsible technology, minimal computing can play a role in public scholarship and community partnerships that extend existing academic research.<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  Minimal computing has largely grown in digital humanities contexts by emphasizing the preservation of the scholarly and cultural record. But the use of minimal computing tools and techniques in digital humanities research can also provide a model for the understanding, critique, and application of those tools in the broader world. What academics call minimal computing has independently taken root outside universities through grassroots organizing, activism, and advocacy on technology. Two groups of people are having the same conversation in two different contexts: for every Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities there’s a Detroit Equitable Internet Initiative, for every Harvard MetaLab, a Pittsburgh MetaMesh. It’s especially important to recognize these existing parallels as many expect the makeup of academia to change dramatically from the coronavirus’s irreparable damage to already-misguided university budgets. Asking  “What do we need?”  in minimal computing now means defining the we that will constitute researchers, scholars, and archivists as graduate programs contract and the professoriate is hollowed out. If we can’t count on institutional support, what comes next?</p>
<p>While the pandemic has widened fault lines that long predate the current crisis, academics can now triangulate a new we as the common ground shifts beneath our feet. If universities fail, digital humanities praxis will continue elsewhere. The pandemic provides the occasion for community technologists and digital humanists to join efforts, and for academics to contribute their energies to support the voices and vision of community-based organizations.</p>

<p>This process of relaying messages through intermediaries is called routing, and a crucial part of building mesh networks is the development and deployment of routing algorithms that optimize network efficiency in terms of several possible variables, including: minimizing number of intermediate steps or ’hops’ [between network nodes], minimizing time or cost of message delivery, maximizing the quantity of overall throughput in the network, performing well in the presence of high levels of message traffic or noise, and perhaps most importantly, maximizing network resiliency, meaning the capacity of messages to be successfully routed from sender to receiver even in the event of lost intermediate links.<br>

<p>As Chayka notes,  “I began thinking of this universal feeling as the longing for less. It’s an abstract, almost nostalgic desire, a pull toward a different, simpler world. Not past nor future, neither utopian nor dystopian, this more authentic world is always just beyond our current existence in a place we can never quite reach. Maybe the longing for less is the constant shadow of humanity’s self-doubt: What if we were better off without everything we’ve gained in modern society?”   <sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:43" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Williams continues:  “In many cases, this rejection occurred on the basis of philosophical or cosmological disagreements with the old packages. This has, of course, had many great benefits. Yet by rejecting entire packages of constraint, we’ve also rejected those constraints that were actually useful for our purposes. When you dismantle existing boundaries in your environment, it frees you from their limitations, but it requires you to bring your own boundaries where you didn’t have to before. Sometimes, taking on this additional self-regulatory burden is totally worth it.

<p>Ticona conducts a comparative study of how workers in different sectors manage the  “entrance of mobile phones into the workplace . . . within a marketplace where jobs are increasingly uncertain and insecure.”  She finds that  “service workers deployed strategies of everyday resistance in concert with their ICTs to gain a feeling of autonomy within the power structures of their workplaces. The knowledge workers deployed strategies of inaccessibility to resist the work-extending affordances of their devices and decouple from work which threatened to colonize too much of their lives. Both service and knowledge workers deploy strategies that may obscure the institutional sources of their problems by overindividualizing risk and responsibility”   <sup id="fnref1:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>.

<p>Here, we might think of earlier calls among digital humanists to ground their theories in community practice, or more specifically, by rethinking what constitutes scholarly community. Rita Raley, providing the examples of DHCommons and the HASTAC Scholars program, writes:  “Tactical activities are increasingly framed in terms of community and infrastructural investment, and the result has been a proliferation of community labs and gardens and alternative systems of exchange. To take a tactical, media-informed approach to the digital humanities is thus to renew one’s commitments to the sharing of knowledge — not simply references and links but, more important, ideas”   <sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup>.

<p>In 2004, John Gruber, a user interface designer and blogger, released a new markup language, entitled Markdown, featuring what he claimed was simple and self-evident syntax.  “The best way to get a feel for Markdown&rsquo;s formatting syntax,”  he asserted,  “is simply to look at a Markdown-formatted document”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Gruber’s language relied on a set of simple conventions mimicking those in email correspondence. Users could surround words in single and double asterisks to signal italics and bold fonts, respectively, and create header levels by preceding header titles with a corresponding number of hashtags (i.e., # for H1 and ## for H2). This simplicity was an explicit design goal that permeated Markdown&rsquo;s design language and resulted in its quick adoption.</p>
<p>Markdown&rsquo;s simplicity arises from its composition and plain text file format.  “The overriding design goal of Markdown,”  writes Gruber,  “is the idea that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is,  <em>as plain text</em> , without looking like it&rsquo;s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions”   <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. According to the Unicode Standard, plain text files are a  “pure sequence of characters”  that  “contain enough information to permit the text to be rendered legibly, and nothing more”   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. It contrasts plain text with styled or rich text, which is  “any text representation consisting of plain text plus added information such as a language identifier, font size, color, hypertext links, and so on”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Plain text files benefit from simplicity, portability across different platforms, and longevity. These qualities make it more than just a file type. For Dennis Yi Tenen, plain text is an  “editorial method of text transcription that is both &lsquo;faithful to the text of its source&rsquo; and is &rsquo;easier to read than the original documents&rsquo;”   <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. In contrast to the maximization of  “system-centric ideals,”  he sees plain text as embodying minimalism <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Plain text exposes the structure of digital encoding and resists what N. Katherine Hayles calls the  “flickering signifier.”  In Saussurean semiotics, signifiers are unitary, durable, and lack internal structures. In contrast, Hayles argues that  “flickering signifiers”  infuse computational systems <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. These are signs embedded in layered informatics where small actions, like the press of a key, can cause massive changes in hardware and software. They literally flicker due to computer monitors refreshing their presence multiple times per second, resulting in observers always witnessing them in a state of flux <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. While plain text relies on the same computational hardware, it provides a voyeuristic look into what Tenen calls the  “textual lamination”  of digital materials <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This textual lamination refers to the ways that the digital binds text on a screen in a series of physical and networked computational infrastructures.</p>
<p>Markup languages, like Markdown, also allow writers to structure plain-text documents without aesthetic differentiations in typography. According to the Unicode Standard, markup languages function by  “interspersing plain text data with sequences of characters that represent the additional data structure”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. By preserving sequences of characters as plain text, these languages can separate tags from  “real content.”  For many advocates, this mechanism allows writers to focus on content while leaving design issues to others.</p>
<p>The separation of form and content comes with challenges. Chief amongst these is the fragmentation of language protocols as practitioners expand capabilities. Gruber designed Markdown to have a limited feature set, but his decisions bumped up against practicality as popular websites such as GitHub, Reddit, Stack Exchange, Tumblr, and WordPress began permitting users to post in Markdown. New Markdown parsers and variations quickly emerged <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. For Gruber, these  “flavors”  provided evidence of open ingenuity rather than chaos. When asked why he did not seek standardization, Gruber responded  “I believe Markdown&rsquo;s success is  <em>due to</em> , not in spite of, its lack of standardization. And its success is not disputable”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During the flurry of activity to expand Markdown, John MacFarlane, Professor of Philosophy at UC Berkeley, released pandoc, a command-line utility that reads various Markdown flavors and outputs them to different formats <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. This allowed Markdown to serve as a protocol for creating diagrams, slide decks, and even websites. Most importantly, pandoc provided a way for Markdown to include citations and footnotes that resulted in it gaining popularity amongst a niche group of academics for scholarly research.</p>
<p>Pandoc permitted Markdown to serve as a viable option for various genres of writing, but what does Markdown have to do with minimal computing? According to Alex Gil,  “minimal computing is the application of minimalist principles to computing”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. He draws inspiration from designer and architect Ernesto Oroza’s extemporal ethnography of Cuba’s DIY culture. In Havana, Oroza finds a city where participants resist bureaucratic intervention and create idiosyncratic habitats. He stresses the  “moral modulor,”  who by necessity sees the city through a lens of survival <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.  “The moral modulor is an individual who has the impulse to rebuild human life, and this is something he does for his children or his family,”  states Oroza.  “His condition allows him to discriminate against the superfluous or the useless”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Although these practices in Havana may seem far from digital humanities research, they provide a paradigm for how digital humanities scholars and practitioners should view infrastructure more broadly. Put another way, Gil sees in Havana&rsquo;s  “architecture of necessity”  a catalyst for a digital humanities community that discards — read: minimizes — the extraneous. He asks us to look self-reflexively at our operations and orient them around the question of  “What do we need?”   <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Minimal computing includes a myriad of definitions and practices. According to Jentery Sayers, the minimal in minimal computing can refer to design, usage, consumption, maintenance, barriers, Internet, externals, space, and technical language. Yet, he leaves open the possibility for other forms of minimalism:  “I did not account for all the minimals or their particulars here”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Likewise, Gil states,  “minimal computing is in the eye of the beholder”   <sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Due to the often-ambiguous definitions of minimal computing, we must turn to self-identified practitioners to understand its relationship with Markdown. As Gregory Bateson notes, cultural activities, such as play, serve as meta-communication through their self-referential nature <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. In minimal computing, plain-text scholarship in Markdown signals, This is minimal computing. This switch from the ontological to the methodological is common when defining the digital humanities. As Rafael Alvarado notes, digital humanities, like minimal computing, has no real definition, and it is better to see digital humanities as a social field rather than an ontological one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of a definition, we have a genealogy, a network of family resemblances among provisional schools of thought, methodological interests, and preferred tools, a history of people who have chosen to call themselves digital humanists and who in the process of trying to define the term are creating that definition.<br>
<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> <br>
As we look for a  “genealogy”  of minimal computing tools, Markdown emerges as a recurring theme. Jentery Sayers and Alex Gil, self-identified minimal computing practitioners, frequently tout Markdown-inspired static site generators and plain-text scholarship as epitomizing minimal values and assuring sustainability. For example, in an analysis of Tenen and Grant Wythoff&rsquo;s workflow for sustainable plain-text scholarship in Markdown, Gil praises the workflow’s ability to produce  “minimal knowledge with the production of a minimal artifact, without creating necessary friction for the readers”   <sup id="fnref3:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. He laments user-friendly interfaces for their potential to lead to what Matthew Kirschenbaum calls a  “haptic fallacy” :  “the belief that electronic objects are immaterial simply because we cannot reach out and touch them”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Likewise, Sayers asserts that Jekyll, a Markdown reliant static site generator, is representative of  “minimal design”   <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Jekyll forms the basis for prominent minimal computing websites, such as those for the Minimal Computing Working Group, and projects, such as Ed. and Wax. We should note that Markdown is, of course, not the totality of minimal computing practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Markdown as a digital humanities practice is noticeable for not just its technical innovation but the discourses surrounding it. These discourses stress Markdown as a force for sustainable scholarship, easing barriers of entry to digital humanities in the Global South, and as a means for subverting governmental surveillance. According to Bradley Dilger and Jeff Rice,  “Despite the predominant roles markup plays in online writing, and despite the social, cultural, rhetorical, and technological implications of these roles, markup is often taken for granted as merely the code behind the text”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. In response, this article explores the sustainability of Markdown as a digital humanities practice by looking back to a key precursor: Donald Knuth’s TeX.</p>
<p>Readers may wonder why I focus on TeX and not other markup languages, such as HTML or TEI. Markup languages emerged in the 1960s when users used markups or flags to distinguish between lower and upper-case letters. These flags were often proprietary, making it difficult for different computational platforms to interact with one another. In 1967, Michael Kay implored scholars to create a  “standard code in which any text received from an outside source can be assumed to be”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. The most influential of these markup languages was the Generalized Markup Language (GML) created by Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher, and Raymond Lorie at IBM in 1969. GML served as a foundation for the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) released in 1986, which in turn provided a protocol for creating new markup languages like HTML and XML <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>TeX and Markdown are notable for their embrace by scholars as computational tools for printed text. This is not to say that they do not use other markup languages, such as HTML and TEI, to disseminate research. In fact, digital humanities scholars often stress alternative publishing platforms, such as online exhibits, blogs, and digital maps as meaningful forms of scholarship themselves. However, this is in contrast to TeX and Markdown where the goal is to create a more efficient workflow to output digital materials in analog formats like academic journals and monographs.</p>
<p>In this paper, TeX&rsquo;s development and community provide a case study and catalyst for the social and cultural development of Markdown as a minimal computing practice. From the 1970s to the 1990s, academic researchers used TeX to construct plain-text scholarship in mathematics and the hard sciences to enhance typographical output. Most academics saw these concerns as holding marginal importance and abandoned TeX for What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) word processors, especially in the humanities. Drawing on queer theorist Michael Warner, I argue that the community surrounding TeX responded reactionarily to these transformations by forming a counterpublic constituted through a myriad of texts that bemoaned word processors <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. This counterpublic persisted well into the 2000s but only made headway amongst a niche scholarly audience. After exploring TeX, I conclude by looking at the lessons it provides digital humanities scholars about embracing minimal computing practices like Markdown-based scholarship. As I make evident, although minimal computing encompasses a range of modalities, discourses surrounding Markdown mirroring those of TeX should give pause to those seeking to implement it in practice.</p>
<h2 id="taking-tex-seriously">Taking TeX Seriously</h2>
<p>To understand Markdown-based scholarship in the digital humanities and growing advocacy for its use, I turn to the history of computing. The history of computing remains a niche field and has had little overlap with the digital humanities. Historians of computing have dismissed the latter as narrowly focusing on career development and sidelining issues that concern other humanities scholars. As Thomas Haigh — echoing Bruno Latour&rsquo;s criticism of modernity concludes —  “We have never been digital”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Yet, computing&rsquo;s history can provide valuable insights into minimal computing practices.</p>
<p>Given markup&rsquo;s popularity amongst programmers and technical writers, it may be tempting to see it as an extension of programming. However, the catalyst for plain-text scholarship stems from developments and concerns about digital typography best exemplified by Donald Knuth’s TeX. A mathematical prodigy, Knuth won a scholarship to Case Western Institute, where he tinkered with the university’s IBM 650, an early mainframe computer, in his spare time. After switching concentrations from physics to mathematics, Knuth graduated with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and, by a special vote of the faculty, a Master of Science for exceptional work. He went on to earn a doctorate in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology and joined its faculty as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics in 1963 <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Knuth began writing his magnum opus,  <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em> , originally a comprehensive work about compilers, full time in 1962 but took a break to investigate the statistical properties of linear probing. This break had a profound impact on Knuth who proposed a broader project to his publisher about computational algorithms. By the summer of June 1965, he had completed three thousand handwritten pages (roughly two thousand pages of printed text), and Addison-Wesley agreed to publish the revised work in seven parts. With Knuth’s desire for  <em>The Art of Programming</em>  to mirror the totality of computer science algorithms, he continued to amend the work throughout his career. While revising the second edition of the book in 1976, Knuth received galley proofs from his publisher. Addison-Wesley had adopted a new digital-infused workflow, and Knuth became so aghast at the typographical quality that he threatened to quit the project altogether <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Pausing from writing  <em>The Art of Programming</em> , Knuth sought to explore how computer science could enhance typography after seeing a high-resolution digital typesetting machine in 1977. By dividing a page into discrete sections (pixels), he searched algorithmically for the ideal place for ink (1) or not (0).  “As a computer scientist, I really identify with patterns of 0’s and 1’s; I ought to be able to do something about this,”  noted Knuth <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Knuth&rsquo;s work on typography formed the basis for TeX, and he dedicated his 1977–1978 academic sabbatical to the project. Approximately a year later, the American Mathematical Society invited Knuth to give a lecture that he used to stress TeX’s superiority and mathematical underpinning. For the attending academic audience, TeX offered numerous benefits. As the TeX User Group’s official history notes, creating academic articles at the time was expensive and relied on proprietary software. A document created in one software program often rendered differently on competing systems. TeX solved these issues by providing a free markup system that was portable across platforms and geared towards academic work <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We should pause to underline that TeX&rsquo;s development had little to do with easing composition as later enthusiasts would argue. While the portability of TeX did allow researchers to exchange files without vendor lock-in, researchers were more concerned about preserving aesthetics rather than stripping away content and form. They exchanged TeX files with typographical information and choices affixed in document front matter so that others could compose facsimiles rather than leave questions of appearance to them.</p>
<p>Despite TeX’s advantages, it had a steep learning curve. Seeking to assist newcomers, computer scientist Leslie Lamport assembled a series of macros for TeX, which he called LaTeX, in 1984. LaTeX took cues from Scribe, a markup language Brian Reid created for his doctoral dissertation that popularized logical design, a philosophy that separated the production of content from appearance. Reid claimed that Scribe allowed writers to focus on their writing rather than aesthetics, and by utilizing a small set of declarations, they could still output their creations to different formats <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Despite its innovations, many remained apprehensive about what they saw as Scribe’s rigidity. Early responses touted LaTeX as  “Scribe liberated from inflexible formatting control”  and  “TeX for the masses”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. In his original manual  <em>LaTeX: A Document Preparation System</em> , Lamport acknowledges his desire for a simpler system.  “In turning TeX into LaTeX, I have tried to convert a highly-tuned racing car into a comfortable family sedan,”  writes Lamport,  “The family sedan isn&rsquo;t meant to go as fast as a racing car or be as exciting to drive, but it&rsquo;s comfortable and gets you to the grocery store with no fuss”   <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The rhetoric around LaTeX differed significantly from TeX. Lamport, like Reid, saw logical design as a chance to ease composition and to prevent vendor lock-in. This is not to say that concerns of typography disappeared, but they had diminished considerably. TeX’s typographic benefits originally drew Lamport’s interest, but his assemblage of easy-to-use macros shifted how advocates pitched TeX&rsquo;s benefits and would serve as a catalyst for later claims by Markdown enthusiasts. Still, most academics continued to find markup-oriented scholarship to be unnecessarily difficult to use, and with WYSIWYG word processing software more readily available, all but the most diehard users defected, especially in the humanities.</p>
<p>Word processing had emerged during the 1970s as an organizational paradigm for centralizing corporate information <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Businesses created word processing departments that focused on text production in an attempt to ease the burden on other departments. Manufacturers, such as IBM and Wang, created standalone systems for this new information management paradigm, and by the early 1980s, these machines were commonplace in corporate America. Word processing software dedicated solely to text editing, on the other hand, was of marginal purpose. As Thomas Haigh notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It … seemed no more sensible to use a computer to edit than to travel to the shopping mall in a supersonic fighter jet. Only the plummeting cost of interactive computing could turn an absurd luxury into an expensive tool with economic justifications in specialized fields, and eventually into an inexpensive office commonplace. <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As personal computers expanded into business environments during the late 1980s, word processing&rsquo;s meaning shifted to refer to standalone software for manipulating text. WYSIWYG editors provided real-time rendering of how text would look on paper if the user printed it. Various manufacturers created competing programs throughout the decade, but Microsoft Word emerged as the market leader by the middle of the 1990s, in turn becoming the de facto standard for academic manuscripts.</p>
<p>If TeX remained a novel typographical system, its impact on the academic community would be minimal as many would have abandoned it when WYSIWYG editors became more efficient at displaying mathematical formulas. However, discourses about TeX&rsquo;s utility shifted with the widespread adoption of personal computing. Rather than emphasizing its technical features, advocates posited it as resisting word processing’s dominance as a compositional tool. Their discourses focused on two key trends. First, critics asserted that word processing software&rsquo;s proprietary formats threatened open access of scholarly information. Second, they saw word processors as distracting during intellectual labor. Matthew Kirschenbaum notes,  “Word processing … shapes and informs literary subjects — the persons who inhabit the system (and economy) of literature, green-screeners or otherwise”   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. As writers change their tools, these tools shape their composition and orient them into a techno-social framework centered around the process of writing. It is in this social milieu that TeX became a social force for connecting detractors of word processing, rather than just a typographical apparatus.</p>
<p>By the late 1990s and early 2000s, TeX’s users formed a counterpublic united through texts lamenting word processors. As Michael Warner demonstrates, counterpublics shape queer identity and challenge Jürgen Habermas&rsquo;  “bourgeois”  public sphere <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Habermas correlates the public sphere&rsquo;s rise in the eighteenth century with the emergence of coffeehouses, cafes, salons, and reading clubs in France, England, and Germany. In these spaces, the notion of citizenship blended with an abstracted universal body <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. Nancy Fraser criticizes this universalizing impetus of the public sphere and draws attention to  “subaltern counterpublics”  that emphasized identity and power <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Michael Warner draws on Fraser’s conception to make evident how texts&rsquo; circulations are critical in forming counterpublics. He notes that the public refers to a myriad of contradictory definitions. On one hand, the public refers to a totality whose members are defined through a set of universalities. A public, on the other hand, refers to a subset within this broader public. Warner considers a third definition of public.  “This kind of public,”  notes Warner,  “comes into being only in relation to texts and their circulation. It exists  <em>by virtue of being addressed</em> ”   <sup id="fnref2:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. The audience&rsquo;s attention to the text creates a set of relationships, and in doing so, formulates a distinct poetic worldview <sup id="fnref3:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As corporations embraced word processing during the 1990s, desktop publishing constituted a specific public defined through the circulation of texts, advertisements, images, and videos addressing a neoliberal workforce. According to Jamie Peck and Adam Tickell, neoliberalism has two distinct phases of state mobilization: a  “roll-back”  and a  “roll-out.”  In the roll-back period of the 1980s, political elites mobilized the state to create mass deregulation and implemented supply-side economic policies. These policies catapulted Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan into political office but reached their political limit by the 1990s. This led to neoliberalism&rsquo;s  “roll-out,”  where policymakers mobilized the state to regulate and discipline the same individuals dispossessed by neoliberalization, namely African American and Latino communities <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Eschewing collective political action, neoliberalism imparted ideas of self-entrepreneurship, confidence, and prudence onto political subjects.</p>
<p>Neoliberal market ideology, as Fred Turner shows, intersected with advocacy for deregulation by cybercultural entrepreneurs <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. For neoliberal policymakers, computers with WYSIWYG desktop publishing software were essential to launching micro-marketing campaigns, assessing the labor force quantitatively, and accelerating policy report and white paper creation. In this environment, TeX served as a counterpublic against capitalist exploitation of intellectual labor. Although most TeX users were white, their outlook on academic publishing pushed them against the neoliberalizing trend of efficiency and commercial concerns. As historians have noted about the formation of this community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TeX resulted in a worldwide community of users, developers, and user groups evolved, largely disconnected from the more conventional desktop publishing world driven by commercial concerns of publishers and desktop publishing system vendors (so very different than Knuth’s concerns for TeX). This community remains vibrant today, 40 years later, and is an important branch in the development of desktop publishing. <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concentrated community backlash to business practices was in part due to Knuth’s curation of enthusiasts around his software. On February 22, 1980, a small group of enthusiasts bound through Knuth&rsquo;s influence formed the TeX Users Group (TUG). According to Beeton, Berry, and Walden,  “The formation of TUG was an important step in TeX&rsquo;s becoming widely popular and in TEX development activity eventually becoming independent of Stanford”   <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. From 1982, Knuth also began to hold a MetaFont for Lunch Brunch to discuss typography — the name alludes to his complementary technology for specifying fonts, which failed to gain traction <sup id="fnref2:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. The group and Knuth’s academic connections ensured that a series of graduate researchers, faculty, and outside contributors would continue to develop and notably, write about the system. By the decade&rsquo;s end, TeX User Groups had close to four thousand members and growing international reach. They began publishing a journal entitled  <em>TUGBoat</em>  with support from the American Mathematical Society, and the circulation of this new journal helped solidify the counterpublic.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, concerns about word processing&rsquo;s growing influence in the academic environment and distracting tendencies dominated texts about TeX. For instance, an early critique of word processors underlies Lamport&rsquo;s discussion of LaTeX. In his original manual, he compares logical design to visual design (another term for what you see is what you get). According to Lamport, LaTeX  “encourages better writing”  by causing writers to focus on their document&rsquo;s logical structure <sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. It also allows for better focus on text&rsquo;s composition rather than design:  “LaTeX was designed to free you from formatting concerns, allowing you to concentrate on writing. If, while writing, you spend a lot of time worrying about form, you are probably misusing LaTeX”   <sup id="fnref2:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. This critique became explicit in Lamport&rsquo;s 1994 revised manual. He notes that when he wrote LaTeX, there were few facilities for authors to typeset their documents whereas they had become commonplace by the mid-1990s. He goes on to explicitly lambast the development of  “WYSIWYG programs [that] replace LaTeX&rsquo;s logical design with visual design”   <sup id="fnref3:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Later guides for LaTeX — which became the de facto flavor of TeX — would reassert claims about word processing’s perceived flaws for academic work. In 1989, for instance, Jon Warbrick released a condensed version of Lamport’s manual. In it, he writes,  “A visual system makes it easier to create visual effects rather than a coherent structure; logical design encourages you to concentrate on your writing and makes it harder to use formatting as a substitute for good writing”   <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. Another widely circulated manual by Gavin Maltby in 1992, entitled  <em>An Introduction to TeX and Friends</em> , notes,  “Essential to the spirit of TeX is that  <em>it formats the document whilst you just take care of the content</em> , making for increased productivity”   <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Another self-described  “polemical rant in favor of TeX as opposed to word processors”  by Allin Cottrell, Professor of Economics at Wake Forest University, describes Knuth&rsquo;s invention as a panacea to WYSIWYG word processors’ faults.  “The word processor is a stupid and grossly inefficient tool for preparing text for communication with others,”  contends Cottrell <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The conflation of TeX with logical design focused on content creation rather than typography continues into the present. For example, the website for the LaTeX project prominently states the importance of separating content from presentation:  “LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content ”   <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. It contrasts LaTeX with how an author would format a document by determining layout and font.  “This has two results,”  notes the site,  “authors wasting their time with designs; and a lot of badly designed documents!”   <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>
<p>In short, by the late 1990s and early 2000s, a counterpublic emerged through blogs, newspaper articles, and online discussion forums, positioning TeX as an alternative to word processing for academic production. As Warner makes evident,  “texts themselves do not create publics [or counterpublics], but the concatenation of texts through time. Only when a previously existing discourse can be supposed, and a responding discourse can be postulated, can a text address a public”   <sup id="fnref4:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Readers in mathematical fields may wonder how TeX can be a counterpublic given its popularity in their disciplines. It is important to emphasize that counterpublics often gain wide support amongst certain subgroups.  “A counterpublic maintains at some level, conscious or not, an awareness of its subordinate status,”  argues Warner.  “The cultural horizon against which it marks itself off is not just a general or wider public but a dominant one,”  he continues <sup id="fnref5:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. For instance, queer communities may have consumer literature challenging heteronormative relationships, but these works remain niche amongst mainstream publishers. Likewise, even though TeX has adoption in mathematical fields, it has little support in the corporate world, governmental sector, or most academic disciplines.</p>
<h2 id="the-pitfalls-of-markdown">The Pitfalls of Markdown</h2>
<p>TeX&rsquo;s origins and subsequent development provide unique insight for scholars of minimal computing. As mentioned earlier, minimal computing advocates often stress Markdown and Markdown-adjacent tools as representative, although not the totality of, their practice. In this brief conclusion, I assess four cautious lessons that TeX provides minimal computing practitioners about the adoption of Markdown-based scholarship in the digital humanities.</p>
<p>The first lesson TeX provides is that the adoption of niche tools rarely eases barriers of entry and access. With the rise of WYSIWYG word processors, digital composition opened up to a wider range of individuals. Works that were in TeX pushed against this mainstream adoption. As a result, with growing familiarity of computers throughout the 1990s, only those that knew what TeX was, found its system easier to manage, and most importantly, had the specialized training often gained in graduate school to manipulate it were able to contribute. Anne B. McGrail draws attention to a similar issue in minimal computing in reference to her community college students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My students might read Gil’s and Sayer’s pieces but they will likely write about them using Google or Word on their laptops and email me using Outlook — transgressing minimal computing principles at every keystroke. For these definitions of minimal computing themselves point to a set of assumptions for humanistic computing that are worth considering in CC students’ digital lives.<br>
<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup><br>
Second, TeX shows that plain-text scholarship, like that written in Markdown, requires a large infrastructure to support it and is far from minimal. In fact, criticisms of large-scale infrastructures as limiting forces in the digital humanities well precede the Minimal Computing Working Group. In a 2012 study of digital humanities projects, Joris van Zundert concludes:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At least as far as digital humanities research is concerned, there is little benefit to be expected from the current large infrastructure projects. Their all-purpose nature enforces a generalized strategy aimed at the establishment of standards which is at odds with innovative, explorative research. Being standards-driven, institutionally bound, and at worst enforcing specific implementations, they are platforms of exclusiveness. <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Echoing Gil&rsquo;s later remark that minimal computing advocates should orient themselves around the question of  “what we need,”  Zundert writes that digital humanities infrastructures  “should indeed be the simplest thing that could possibly work”   <sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. Yet, TeX shows that most supporters, including Knuth, were often only able to contribute to the project due to the support of their respective academic institutions. Likewise, Markdown-oriented site generators, such as Jekyll, stress the free hosting of GitHub, a company Microsoft bought for over $7.5 billion and backs with its large corporate infrastructure. The impact of Microsoft’s large server network, muddled with bit rot and electrical waste, is rarely taken into account.</p>
<p>Third, TeX shows that plain-text scholarship is not significantly more future-proof or sustainable compared to more proprietary alternatives. In regards to their workflow, Tenen and Wythoff argue,  “Writing in plain text guarantees that your files will remain readable ten, fifteen, twenty years from now.”  They contrast this with proprietary formats, like Word or Google Docs, that  “may go the way of WordPerfect in the future”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. While the  “plain sequence of characters”  is likely to be readable, the scripts scholars rely on to convert their documents into more acceptable publishing standards have limited upkeep. As TeX grew in popularity, support for older versions waned leaving many scholars without an easy means of reconverting their documents. To turn back Markdown, it’s important to remember that a key reason for its growing popularity is its ability to transform into a wide variety of formats through pandoc. Although a variety of coders contribute to it, ultimately, it relies on the leadership of MacFarlane, and it is unclear how long it would survive without his input. In contrast, large organizations and governmental agencies that have adopted proprietary software along with the corporations that produce this software have a much greater incentive to maintain compatibility.</p>
<p>Finally, plain-text scholarship provides little security for vulnerable political activists as claimed by boosters. Gil notes how sites off-grid can assist political revolution. He highlights a project entitled No Connect that he and his colleagues developed at Columbia University&rsquo;s Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. No Connect is a theme for Jekyll meant for users without an internet connection. Presumably, this allows political dissidents to distribute subversive and sensitive materials through Sneakernets, informal networks for transferring information through physical mediums such as CD-ROMs, floppy disks, and USB drives. While such sites may circumnavigate traditional computer networks, they come with their challenges. For instance, governmental agencies posing as bureaucrats can steal or copy them. These same individuals may produce malware and keyloggers that are automatically installed when a user places the USB drive in their computer, compromising more elements of the Sneakernets. A popular exploit places a large surge of electricity through the USB port frying the machine <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Later developments of TeX/LaTeX introduced security risks due to their reliance on macros <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. While Markdown does not rely on as many macros, its convoluted conversion structure leaves it open to similar vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Of course, minimal computing is divergent and growing, and the emphasis on plain-text scholarship that this article highlights does not represent the field&rsquo;s totality. Many advocates of minimal computing have little focus on markup languages. Nonetheless, by historicizing and contextualizing Markdown through my analysis of TeX, I have sought to show some of the pitfalls that may occur through widespread adoption. In the future, these issues may be solved, but TeX’s lessons should give digital humanities scholars a cautionary warning.</p>

<p>Minimalist computing principles in scholarly communications focus on the moderation of digital resource consumption and global social equity <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  Such an application of minimalist principles to computing is designed both to make the global flow of digital information accessible _ to_  the widest audiences and to allow the broadest set of people to participate in the creation  <em>of</em>  such resources. By minimizing the resource constraints required to run computational architectures, minimalist computing principles work to ensure that the world is not falsely separated into a Global expert North and a Global apprentice South, in which those with resources merely export digital expertise outwards from a claimed center to the supposed margins <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Minimalist computational principles are designed for inclusivity.</p>
<p>By contrast, contemporary models of scholarly communication — the composite systems through which academics and other intellectuals disseminate their findings for global consumption — appear to be the opposite of minimalist. They cover a full and ever-expanding disciplinary range, from natural scientific outputs, to humanistic arguments, to social scientific research. Their social processes and techniques are vast, involving peer review systems, citations, references, and footnotes <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. The technical elements of such systems also tend to proliferate, including platforms, persistent identifiers, XML standards, digital preservation systems, and manuscript management technologies <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The costs involved in these dissemination systems are also maximal. Since the 1980s, rising in line with the expansion of higher education, the cost of subscribing to academic serials has outpaced inflation by approximately 6% every year <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, while library budgets have faced cuts or remained flat <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Over forty years, this amounts to a several-hundredfold price increase. A discourse of maximalism and growth seems omnipresent in scholarly communications.</p>
<p>These maximalist principles in scholarly communications have resulted in well-known damaging consequences and inequalities. For instance, Thomas Mboa Nkoudou notes the spread of an  “epistemic alienation”  when researchers at the margins of the Global North’s publication systems must conform to external pressures and norms <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. As another example, peer review is supposed to be a system that distinguishes work based solely on merit rather than any identity characteristic of the author. However, critics of this system note that pre-publication peer review favors those for whom English is their first language <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Further evidence of biases from peer review includes the extraordinary fact that just 1.5% of economics articles in highly ranked journals were about countries other than the United States <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The spiraling, maximalist costs of the for-profit subscription scholarly publication ecosystem also price out much of the world’s population <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. It is in part this inequality that has spurred the open access movement (OA) for research, which seeks to abolish paywalls <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Yet even this movement has come under fire. Built on the premise that nobody, worldwide, should be excluded from access to the scholarly record by their (in)ability to pay and that the benefits of re-use should be broadly extended to third parties using Creative Commons licenses, the road to OA was paved with noble intentions. As Ulrich Herb notes, open access was originally  “embedded in a conceptual ensemble of participation, democratisation, digital commons and equality”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. However, parts of this vision have died over time.  “Nowadays,”  Herb writes,  “Open access seems to be exclusive: to the extent that commercial players have discovered it as a business model and article fees have become a defining feature of gold open access, open access has increasingly transformed into a distinguishing feature and an exclusive element”   <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, the contemporary scholarly communications environment has many defects that pertain to inequality and that intersect with its maximalist characteristics. Given the goals of minimalist computing, rooted in equity and diversity, might it be possible for our scholarly communications to learn from such principles? Is there a way in which ideas of  “scaling small”   <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> might help these systems to contend, as Roopika Risam puts it,  “Not only with the colonial hangovers from the cultural record, but also with forces that are actively constructing the medium of the digital cultural record — the Internet — as a hostile environment”   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>?</p>
<p>In the remainder of this article I turn to a specific illicit scholarly communications practice that has emerged in recent years: the idea of the  “pirate”  shadow library. These archives, which violate copyright, work around paywalls and provide access to all comers. Although frequently on the wrong side of the law, shadow library operators conceive of their sites in ethical terms. Framing their banditry in terms of a Robin Hood-esque outfit, such sites believe they are robbing from the rich to give to the scholarly poor <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> (see also <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>). Importantly for the themes of this special issue, I believe that such archives can also be understood in certain terms of computational minimalism. As I will go on to detail, various technical design principles of these archives lower social barriers to participation. This article thus sets out a fresh theoretical terrain for understanding what I call minimal-maximal tensions in computational architectures and projects. While this discourse is rooted in older information technology debates about microkernels versus macrokernels <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>, through my case study of Library Genesis — the shadow library that is the main focus of this article — I seek to unpack a new framework for thinking about the relationships between minimal components and maximal outcomes. While Library Genesis seeks to shadow an enormous archive, the constraints under which it operates lead to a series of unexpected minimalist design principles.</p>
<h2 id="the-growth-and-emergence-of-shadow-libraries">The Growth and Emergence of Shadow Libraries</h2>
<p>Shadow libraries — pirate archives of copyrighted scholarly publications — emerged in response to a frustration at the slow growth of open access <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. Nonetheless, open-access advocates remain divided as to whether these  “guerilla”  libraries are a solution to, or merely a symptom of, the ills of scholarly communication <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. The two most famous (and interlinked) of these systems for illicit access to pirate scholarship as of 2022 are Sci-Hub and Library Genesis.</p>
<p>The former, Sci-Hub, is a credential-proxying site that bypasses publisher paywalls, primarily for journal articles. Founded by Alexandra Elbakyan in 2011, the site has grown to provide access to at least 68.9% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and to 85.1% of all articles published in subscription journals <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. The site is based in Kazakhstan, which introduces complex jurisdictional legal issues. It works by collecting credentials from academic institutions, possibly by conducting phishing attacks <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. These credentials are then used to fetch any article requested by an end-user. In order to reduce the number of requests to publishers’ sites — and thereby evade detection and a ban on its credentials — Sci-Hub caches fetched journal articles in an archive called Library Genesis. Sci-Hub has faced and lost several court cases, particularly in the U.S. where the publisher Elsevier has been awarded millions of dollars in damages <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. Because the site sits outside of U.S. jurisdiction and because Elbakyan has no means of paying such damages, it is unlikely that publishers will see any financial return from these lawsuits. Nonetheless, for much of 2021, Elbakyan paused the ingestion of new articles while awaiting the results of a court case in India, which could rule in Sci-Hub’s favor <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Library Genesis, by contrast, is the largest and oldest shadow archive on the Internet. With over thirty-three terabytes of data in its primary book collection (and more than sixty terabytes in its pool of scientific journal articles powered by its aforementioned sister project, Sci-Hub), the project is one of the largest repositories of copyright-violating educational ebooks ever created <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Established in 2008, the goal of Library Genesis is nothing short of a totalizing modern Library of Alexandria, albeit without legal sanction. As one of its administrators wrote, emphasizing its extralegal, yet claimed moral and ethical, status:  “Within decades, generations of people everywhere in the world will grow up with access to the best scientific texts of all time&hellip;. [T]he quality and accessibility of education to the poor will grow dramatically too. Frankly, I see this as the only way to naturally improve mankind: we need to make all the information available to them at any time”   <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  Philosophically rooted in the communist principles of its homeland, Russia, and particularly in the Soviet isolationist copyright policies of the 20th century <sup id="fnref1:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>, Library Genesis is a formidable resource and a large-scale threat to conventional academic publishers <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Shadow libraries differ in their models, usage patterns, and effects. The Z-library system, for instance, charges for specific formats, such as Amazon Kindle conversion <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Other pirate libraries such as Library Genesis have no charges at all and their funding mechanisms are unknown, leading to accusations of state subterfuge, although they do use advertising <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. While the total percentage of the market eaten by piracy is unknown, in the general ebook space some studies have shown that as many as 35.1% of books are downloaded illegally <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. What is clear from existing studies of Library Genesis is that it is used by participants worldwide, including in wealthier regions of the Global North <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. Various studies have also shown a citation advantage to papers that appear in Sci-Hub <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>. However, considering the prevalence of material in this archive, this effect could simply be due to the difficulty of obtaining the original papers.</p>
<p>Given that Sci-Hub and Library Genesis are  <em>shadows</em>  of the formalised academic publication system, we might expect them to share the maximalist tendencies of mainstream scholarly communications systems. These libraries are, indeed, enormous. Yet what it means to be a shadow has changed over time. It was not until the 18th century that the shadow became defined as the colorless inverse image of the object itself. Before this point, shadows were represented, in art and heraldry, as a partial transparency and outline. In heraldic terms, shadows represent an outlined shape that reveals a hidden part of the family tree, not a mirror of it <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. That is, shadows can be seen as a shameful family link, rather than a precise formal reflection, and such a history reminds us, as Nanna Bonde Thylstrup puts it, of the  “inherently unstable form of shadow libraries as a cultural construct”   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. In this light, there are several characteristics of shadow libraries that present minimalist design principles and that we can take as refractive and instructive lenses for understanding mainstream practices.</p>
<h2 id="minimalist-shadows">Minimalist Shadows</h2>
<p>Just what, then, is minimalist about these shadow libraries? Certainly, they are minimalist in terms of the minimal barriers that they present to their readership for access to scholarly publications. In eliminating paywalls and presenting only a flat search box, with no authentication mechanisms, Sci-Hub and Library Genesis are far simpler than the systems used by formal publishers. By contrast, these archives are  <em>not</em>  minimal in terms of the  “minimal space”  that they consume <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Nonetheless, I will argue that we can understand shadow libraries in minimal terms along a number of axes: minimalist surface exposure, minimalist metadata design principles, and minimalist distributional principles. I will cover each of these in turn, primarily with respect to Library Genesis.</p>
<p>To begin with the minimal surface exposure of the site, as a highly illegal, copyright-violating initiative that also wants to achieve worldwide transformation of educational potential, Library Genesis finds itself in a minimal-maximal double bind. On one hand, it must remain difficult to access, hidden, and must lie low to evade law enforcement. It must be a resource with a minimal surface. On the other hand, to achieve its stated goals, this resource must be accessible and known to as many people as possible. This double bind is not unique to these libraries. Similar minimal-maximal tensions exist within legal digital social justice projects that seek to criticize powerful governmental norms, such as the Global Detention Project. Such platforms are not illegal like Library Genesis, but they seek to criticize often-hostile regimes for a broad audience while avoiding tyrannical government crackdowns.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Library Genesis has several technical hurdles to overcome in its quest to retain its minimal surface presence on the Internet. Two of these are the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) and the threat of (distributed) denial of service (DDOS) attacks. On the first of these fronts, to provide a memorable location for the archive, Library Genesis uses DNS <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. This is the system that translates an address such as gen.lib.rus.ec into an Internet Protocol (IP) address (198.167.223.167, for example). This is a useful system because IP addresses are not easily memorable for humans. However, DNS addresses are subject to takedowns and blocking by Internet Service Providers (ISP). That is, if an allegedly infringed party can persuade a court of law or an ISP that a site’s sole purpose is copyright infringement, the domain name (or IP address) can be blocked for large swathes of users <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. It is, of course, possible to circumvent such blocks by a variety of techniques, such as the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that routes traffic through a different ISP in a friendlier jurisdiction. Systems such as The Onion Router (Tor) are another way of evading these blocks <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Library Genesis plays the games of whack-a-mole and hide-and-seek with DNS <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. Its mirrors rapidly switch between addresses in an attempt to avoid takedowns <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. Given international jurisdictional challenges, it is very hard for countries that  <em>do</em>  care about copyright infringement to shut down Library Genesis permanently. The distributed nature of DNS acts in the interests of projects such as Library Genesis as it is simply impossible, at present, to garner the level of international legal compliance that would be necessary to shut down its DNS records permanently. Advances in DNS privacy and encryption are only likely to make this problem more difficult to combat (see, for instance, <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>.) That said, Library Genesis also has a communication problem with respect to DNS. If the goal of DNS is to provide memorable addresses for sites on the Internet then changing these addresses within a narrow time window frustrates the ultimate purpose of the system. Sites such as Reddit — a contemporary bulletin board system — spread news of new DNS mirrors, but, of course, once these addresses are public, the takedown process can begin anew. It is a war of attrition and, thus far, Library Genesis is winning the war through its guerilla tactics.</p>
<p>The small visible central surface of sites such as Library Genesis, only accessible through circumvention technologies such as VPNs, reflects a phenomenon seen in Alternate Reality Games (ARGs). Such hiddenness is characteristic of ARGs, which often have obscure entry points, conventionally referred to as rabbit holes: points of ingress that lure in new users searching for clues <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>. For Garcia and Niemeyer,  “a ‘good’ rabbit hole is one that, for those not looking for clues, blends into the background and noise of the world”   <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. An example of how Library Genesis seeds such a trail, rather than blatantly advertising itself, can be seen in its metadata. Searching for Library Genesis on Google yields a link but its description only reads,  “No information is available for this page.”  Additionally, the site does not feature in the top results of  “download scientific books for free.”  Instead, one needs to be told about the site and then visit it directly.</p>
<p>This minimal surface principle is also clear in the site’s upload procedures, which intersect with its minimal metadata implementations. Although Library Genesis has a prominent upload link on its homepage, it requires a password to proceed. This gives the impression that uploading is a private activity, conducted only by an elite cadre of individuals who know the magic word.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  In reality, though, users who follow the rabbit hole into the forum on the site and then register can readily find the requisite username and password to begin uploading.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why Library Genesis presents such a minimal surface. While, surely, the core reason for Library Genesis’ minimal surface is its illegality, this feature also lowers the potential for rights-holders to flood the site with false metadata and uploads. Indeed, the gravest threat to Library Genesis’s operation would be contamination of its records with inaccurate files, which could cause a denial-of-service attack against the archive. While the simple reason is that all uploads must be vetted, it would also be surprising if the use of the password seriously deters a concerted effort to pollute the library. As we will also see, though, the minimalist metadata principles of Library Genesis actively  <em>encourage</em>  participation.</p>
<p>In terms of minimal metadata, it is worth first considering the scale of Library Genesis. The main Library Genesis database collection had just short of 1.2 million records (books) in 2014 <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. As of January 2020, this capacity had more than doubled to 2.5 million books. Clearly, a database of epistemological dissent at this size and with this scale of growth requires a lightweight — or, as we might say,  <em>minimal</em>  metadata scheme if it is not to collapse under the strain of its size. Although the ext2 and ext3 filesystems that were commonly used on Linux systems at the time of the database’s inception have a sizable upper limit of 1.3×1020 files per directory, there are known performance issues in handling more than 10,000 <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>. There are also issues of integrity monitoring at this scale. When dealing with 2.5 million records, how can one ensure that physical media degradation —  “bit rot”  — does not lead to corrupted files on the disk that may not come to light for substantial periods? That said, the scale of Library Genesis pales in comparison to formal archives. For instance, a report from 2009 noted that there are over 9,000 missing volumes in the British Library’s main collection, illustrating that this problem exists in both the legal and illegal spaces <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. The British Library is also substantially larger than Library Genesis, with a main collection of approximately 170 million items total and 13.5 million books, with a digital collection that is over a petabyte in size <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Library Genesis is an enormous archive in terms of total size (maximal), but it is composed of files that are relatively small (minimal). The average (mean) file size in the database is 13.90MB, with a significant portion of these files being less than 5MB. The file size distribution varies for the different file types within the database. Despite the accessibility challenges of the format — the Portable Document Format (PDF) is not the best format for screen readers, for instance — PDFs dominate the archive. For PDFs (n=1,697,927), for instance, the tail is longer to trail off and the average file size is higher at 16.49MB. By contrast, EPUB (n=179,926; average: 7.32 MB) and Mobi (n=23,947; average: 4.33MB) bring the mean file sizes down as they can jettison the formatting information inherent in PDF files. Nonetheless, with this volume of small files, addressability is a core performance concern.</p>
<p>The solution that Library Genesis devised for handling such a vast, proliferating archive composed of relatively small files is based on minimalist principles of metadata, distribution, and hashing. Files are  <em>distributed</em>  over multiple directories (called buckets) while being referenced within a database that includes metadata about the file, as well as a message-digest algorithm v5 (MD5) hash of the file, which serves as a filename. There are 47 metadata fields within the database for each entry, which can be subdivided into categories of file and record information, file and record properties, and external identifiers.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  Importantly, though, very few of these fields are  <em>required</em> . The subset that are absolutely necessary are kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>The first of these categories — file and record information — pertains to local lookup of the file. For instance, to retrieve a local file for a record, one simply divides the ID field by 1,000 to get the bucket directory, then retrieves the object with the specified MD5 record from that directory (e.g., 243000/9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6). To specify the content type, a user can append the Extension field (e.g., pdf or epub) to the delivered file (and could also infer the multipurpose Internet mail extensions or MIME type if necessary). In addition to using the Filesize field to check a download, it is also possible to verify that the contents of the file have not been corrupted at any time. This verification is achieved by computing the file’s MD5 hash and then comparing this to the database/filename. Although MD5 is a very old (and possibly even broken) hashing algorithm, it has a 1.47x10-29 chance of a random collision (that is, of two files sharing the same hash) <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. There are no two records within the Library Genesis database that share an MD5 hash as of March 1, 2020.<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>  Nonetheless, the subdivision into bucket directories of 1,000 files makes the on-disk likelihood of two files sharing a hash/filename extremely unlikely and further reduces this risk. The verification algorithm means that the detection of corrupt files can be handled automatically rather than on a reporting basis from users (although computing all MD5 hashes in the database is a computationally demanding task given the scale). These field and record information fields are the bare minimum required to retrieve a file from the filestore.</p>
<p>The second category of metadata field — file and record properties — gives specific metadata for a record, such as the work’s title and authors. Interestingly, for the principles of minimal computational design, the database does not store authors in a structured and linked form, but rather as free-text. Traditionally, if one were designing a relational database where an author could be ascribed to more than one book, one would create a separate database table called author that had properties such as first name,  last name, and ORCID ID, and then, in the books table, link to the author. This would create a mechanism to query an author called, say, Joe Bloggs, and to retrieve all books written by that specific Joe Bloggs. Such a schema would provide high-quality structured data. This is not what Library Genesis does. Instead, it simply stores author names as plaintext. Sometimes this means that authors and editors are listed in a long string, and it is not clear whether authors of the same name are the same person.</p>
<p>Such an approach comes with several minimalist computational advantages. The clearest of these are: (1) there is no need to maintain the structural integrity of the database between tables, and (2) the overhead for entering metadata is greatly simplified by flattening the input. In this way, Library Genesis lowers both the computational requirements for maintenance and the barriers for entry/participation by allowing freeform textual input. Given the size of the database, and the fact that a free-text search can take a long time, the single-field, free-text approach to “author” rather than a linked record also allows interested parties to create their own indexes of the database with relative ease.</p>
<p>The third and final metadata field type (external identifiers) — also entirely optional — demonstrates further minimalist design principles. Instead of storing all metadata locally, the database points to offsite management of such data, allowing for others, likely specialists, to focus entirely on metadata curation, collection, and provision. While this carries some initial lookup overhead for the pirate entering the data, the labor of maintaining this metadata is then outsourced and can be resolved on demand. This all points towards a minimalist labor approach and an awareness that by lowering the threshold for participating to the minimum, the maximalist goals of the project are more likely to be achieved.</p>
<p>If Library Genesis encodes many of its minimalist functions in its metadata design principles, its distributional characteristics are also emblematic of such operations. The distributional minimalism principle can be seen in discussions about the preservation of the archive and the future of sites such as Library Genesis. On the first front of digital preservation, the challenge is that this archive is maximal, not minimal. A reasonable cost estimate for simply the hard disks to mirror the entire 33TB archive as of March 2020 is $1,200. This does not include either redundancy in terms of drive failure or the server hardware in which the hard drives would be housed. In terms of minimal cost scaling, the sheer size of the archive makes for a difficult environment if the local copy is to be complete and usable.</p>
<p>That said, full preservation in every replica may not be the aim of distribution, and it is of course possible for partial replicas of the database to exist worldwide <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>. Clients such as aria2 also make it possible to download a single file from a torrent swarm, which in theory makes single books within the Library Genesis archive addressable and retrievable in distributed form. However, the torrent swarm is not ideal for Library Genesis’s use case. Anybody seeding on the network will have an exposed IP address, and it will be clear that they are participating, with legal risk. For this reason it is likely that many users in the swarm will be connecting using VPNs or so-called seedboxes (remote high-bandwidth servers) in order not only to protect their identity, but also to ensure the efficient, high-speed distribution of the material.</p>
<p>Indeed, in late 2019, coordinating around a pirate archiving initiative known as The Eye, a group of individuals took it upon themselves to ensure the full torrent availability of the Library Genesis filestore. Under this initiative,  “swarm peers increased from 3,000 seeders to 30,000 seeders,”  and  “speeds increased from about 60KB/s on most torrents to over 100MB/s”   <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>. The users who undertook this illegal initiative viewed their work as charitable, presumably under the rubric of educational advancement, which has long held eleemosynary status in many jurisdictions. The amateur archivists who seeded Library Genesis believe that the  “initiative fulfils United Nations/UNESCO world development goals that mandate the removal of restrictions on access to science”  and that  “[l]imiting and delaying humanity’s access to science isn’t a business, it’s a crime, one with an untold number of victims and preventable deaths”   <sup id="fnref1:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>. Somewhat boldly, two seedbox companies — Seedbox.io and UltraSeedbox.com — offered their servers for this avowedly illegal project, thereby providing the bandwidth to achieve the aforementioned speeds <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>. That said, the torrent archive is not viewed as a long-term viable mechanism for distribution, according to these individuals:  “It obviously isn&rsquo;t sane to store 33TB long-term, we just want to push this out to archivers”   <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A potentially more viable distribution, storage, and retrieval mechanism proposed for Library Genesis could be the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>. IPFS presents an addressable, distributed system in which objects are assigned a hash:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content addressed hyper links [sic]. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable [sic], an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.<br>
<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup> <br>
Further, IPFS has a system called pinning, in which objects are immutable and pulled down to clients, thus ensuring their permanent availability:  “This also makes IPFS a Web where links are permanent, and Objects can ensure the survival of others they point to”   <sup id="fnref1:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IPFS does not address the anonymity of nodes that participate, meaning that it would still be possible to locate a serving entity by IP address, which could have legal implications. Such problems could, again, be mitigated by the use of anonymity networks such as Tor. The scalability of IPFS to 33TB of material, spread over 2.5 or so million unique entities of small file sizes is also unproven. An intermediate address lookup table would be needed to translate between the Library Genesis structure and any IPFS version of the platform. However, IPFS would present a minimalist design platform with the distributed preservation of a maximalist scholarly archive, in which many actors all share a small proportion of the total output, contributing towards a holistic totality in fragmentary participation. Nonetheless, once again, the fragmentary approach, in which smaller portions of the archive are distributed between many actors, rather than in a centralised store, yields a minimal approach to the function of a maximal archival.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-maximum">Minimum-Maximum</h2>
<p>Throughout this Library Genesis case study, I have been proposing a framework for thinking about minimal-maximal tensions. It is tempting to consider minimalist computing paradigms as the opposite to proliferating maximal systems. In reality, instead, minimalist paradigms can work as fragments of a distributed whole; this is one of the lessons that we can learn from the pirate archive.</p>
<p>These debates are not abstract for scholarly communications. At present, various research funders across the globe are embarking on the establishment of their own platforms to replace the journal ecosystem. Spurred by the same motivation as Library Genesis and Sci-Hub — the slower-than-desired growth of open access — the Open Research Europe, Wellcome Open Research, and Gates Open Research platforms represent significant centralizations of research outputs under funder control, as opposed to a distributed journal publishing architecture. These platforms, running on the for-profit F1000 platform owned by Taylor &amp; Francis, bill themselves as megajournals, following the terminology developed by the world’s largest journal,  <em>PLOS ONE</em> . There are many competing interests in these systems. Even as such initiatives represent centralizations and maximal architectures, funders insist on open licenses for re-use and re-distribution. Hence, we have centralization efforts mandating licenses that allow for de-centralization and micro/minimal circulation.</p>
<p>Library Genesis also yields various principles of participation and consumption that are minimal in their design, even while they yield access to a maximal resource. By requiring only the minimum of metadata provision, Library Genesis lowers barriers to participation, an aspect also bolstered by the off-shoring and distribution of its identifier systems. In terms of consumption, the single search box that returns all results for everything, ever, represents a maximal centralization. In terms of ease of use and accessibility, this one-stop-shop demonstrates a concision and minimalism that is lacking in most scholarly communications systems.</p>
<p>Finally, Library Genesis demonstrates a minimally exposed surface, mostly due to its illegality. It would be churlish to pretend that there are huge implications for legitimate scholarly communications infrastructures or lessons to be learned from this. The more people have access to scholarship and research, the better. The minimally exposed surface of the shadow archive is precisely — and only — because it must remain hidden. The strait that this archive must navigate, though, is the space between its maximal presence and its minimal entrance, the rabbit holes of the alternate reality game.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in all, I have attempted in this article to document several features of Library Genesis that serve as an index of minimal-maximal infrastructures. At least some of these features could be adopted by mainstream scholarly communications providers to increase not only the resilience of, but also global equity of access to, our publication ecosystems. While shadows are not equal to mirrors, in these senses I contend that there are lessons to be learned from the (shadow) library.</p>

Stimulating collaboration between computer scientists and humanities scholars could potentially lead to insights that are of interest to both disciplines; humanities-oriented reflections on big data analysis can help understandings of its cultural significance, whilst computational analyses of cultural data potentially enrich humanities research about large batches of cultural data. However, as this article shows, interdisciplinary collaboration is often messy and wrought with misunderstanding <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and a great deal of time and effort is spent on trying to create a common agenda as researchers work to comply with goals that are of importance to their own disciplinary concerns. The central argument of this article is that successful interdisciplinary collaboration requires disciplinary recognition if it is to be a fruitful endeavour.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinariness does not warrant immediate celebration. It is important to acknowledge that doing interdisciplinary work requires translation work: specifically, an adaptation of research insights to make sense within another disciplinary perspective, in order to reach conclusions that prove productive to all researchers and disciplines involved. Overcoming epistemological differences between disciplines often makes conflict inevitable within interdisciplinary digital humanities projects <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This is why interdisciplinary research should include self-reflexivity in the process of collaboration (see also <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>) and thereby pay attention to the outcomes and also the  “practice of interdisciplinary collaboration”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This article presents insights into such interdisciplinary digital humanities practices. It delves into a particular case of interdisciplinary translation work to explicate the particularities of what we refer to as interdisciplinary brokering work. The case centres on the collaboration practices of a team of computer scientists, information scientists and media scholars who, over the course of 17 months, user tested and fine-tuned a digital tool as part of a digital humanities pilot study. Throughout this study, the tool became the basis for interdisciplinary knowledge exchange, much like a boundary object  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Furthermore, the team’s brokering and negotiation efforts about insights drawn from user testing illustrate that, while such insights are a product of interdisciplinary meaning-making, these insights are also more strongly guided by the project’s deliverable goals than by concerns about usability.</p>
<p>The tool that became the team’s boundary object, is the Linked Open Data (LOD) exploratory search browser DIVE+<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> , which is part of the CLARIAH Media Suite<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  research environment <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. DIVE+ is a digital cultural heritage browser which aims to support scholars during the first, exploratory, phase of their research by allowing them to create and save search narratives as sequences of search results, connected by scholars in a separate navigation and bookmarking pane in the search browser (see Figure 2). The CLARIAH Media Suite gives access to important Dutch national audiovisual archives and is part of the overarching CLARIAH infrastructure, which is the Dutch national counterpart to the international CLARIN and DARIAH research infrastructures. CLARIAH  “develops, facilitates, and stimulates the use of Digital Humanities resources and infrastructures”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, and offers tools and data for humanities and social sciences research.</p>
<p>Insights into the team’s interdisciplinary collaboration practices are drawn from qualitative data that was collected during a 17 month-long digital humanities research pilot study (2017-2018) that investigated how effectively DIVE+ supported the digital research practices of humanities scholars. Throughout the research study the authors collected data about humanities scholars’ digital search practices by means of focus groups, search tasks and think-aloud protocols, surveys, and questionnaires of in total 122 participants. The authors then traced how these user insights shaped both the development of DIVE+ as well the interdisciplinarity collaboration within the research team.</p>
<p>As the title of this article suggests, brokering plays a key role in grasping the interdisciplinary collaboration within this pilot. Brokering is not simply a metaphor for collaboration. Admittedly borrowed from Innovation Studies <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, brokering draws attention to how, in the contemporary marketplace of ideas, understanding the negotiation between parties or actors is key to explain why certain ideas are embraced or discarded. The concept also conjures up recent debates about how neoliberalism has permeated digital humanities research, and what universities’ and funding agencies’ large-scale investment in the computational turn indicates about the role of cultural critique and hermeneutics within (digital) humanities research <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this case, brokering takes the shape of a brokering community practice <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> in which collaborators  “[negotiate] their own activities and identities, [while shaping] the relationships between their communities of practice”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. The analysis of this practice focuses on how insights uncovered during the pilot – i.e. insights into how humanities scholars actually search in and explore digital archives while using DIVE+ – inform team collaborations and decision-making processes, both on the level of the tool (adjusting for instance its interface, and functionality to align with user needs) and on the level of interdisciplinary research collaboration (e.g., in working to create academic and a project-related research output). We relate this back to how brokering practices reflect who ‘wins’ within the marketplace of ideas by focusing on humanities scholars, who are deemed to have increasingly less agency in digital humanities due to their insistence on close reading, hermeneutic tradition, and interpretation <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. In our case, humanities scholars were involved as part of the interdisciplinary project team, and as the tool’s targeted user group.</p>
<p>This article’s second goal is to connect our qualitative user studies’ insights to interdisciplinary concerns about how knowledge is explored, produced, and disseminated by means of computational tools and digital humanities research practices. This objective relates to prior studies about scholarly research processes and how these may  “inform the development of research environments for digital scholarship in the humanities”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. It is particularly valuable to scholars working on the disciplinary boundary of computer science and the humanities, who grapple with issues of how to translate humanities’ concepts and concerns into computational terms.</p>
<p>In the next section (Section 2) we present the theoretical framework used to analyse the collected data. The methodological section (Section 3) shows how we related qualitative data collection and grounded theory to answer overarching questions about collaboration and brokering practices. Section 4 presents the analysis, with reflections about interdisciplinary brokering and translation work on two levels: (1) the project level, where team meetings and debates indicate the necessity of both theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their empirical, practical application when doing digital humanities work and, (2) the tool level, and the role played by insights drawn from the pilot’s user studies in the team collaboration practices. We conclude in section 5 with a discussion of how our analysis at the user study level maps onto larger interdisciplinary concerns.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while the user study provides qualitative insights into the exploratory search behaviour of 122 users, and that the documented research team collaboration was analysed in order to better understand how interdisciplinary research within the digital humanities works, this study does have clear limitations. We used a mixed-method approach to conduct our qualitative research. This choice was informed by both methodological and practical concerns: we wanted to triangulate insights, while simultaneously adapting our methods to specific research settings. This is why think-aloud protocols were supplemented with questionnaires, research diaries and focus group sessions. This mixed-method approach relied on the team’s collective expertise and as a result helped to translate project insights into new knowledge for dissemination within the different researchers’ respective fields of Computer Science, Media Studies and Information Science.</p>
<h2 id="2-theoretical-framework">2. Theoretical framework</h2>
<h2 id="21-collaboration-as-brokering-work">2.1 Collaboration as brokering work</h2>
<p>Digital humanities research is characterised as interdisciplinary, and works at the boundaries of what are considered computational sciences and the humanities. More often than not, digital humanities are described in terms of how the computational turn has taken effect in the humanities, thereby mirroring all-encompassing processes of the datafication of modern society <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. In this article, we look at what this computational work means for the boundaries between disciplines, in terms of interdisciplinary collaboration practices. Collaboration between different disciplines and different skill-sets is key in digital humanities projects <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. With collaboration comes the need for translations of concepts and methods. Furthermore, and especially within disciplines that focus on negotiations between actors to delineate how technological artefacts are developed, brokering work itself is recognized as a shaping actor <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, even at the level of project management <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Masson describes two trends in digital humanities research that relate to the core objectives of this paper: (1) the critical engagement with digital tools and data, and (2) the growing tendency to refer to digital humanities research as transdisciplinary, drawing into focus the work of creating a  “shared conceptual framework”   <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> by collaborating disciplines. Transdisciplinarity contrasts with interdisciplinary and multidisciplinarity in the sense that the former is transformative, while interdisciplinarity is concerned with linking and integrating, and multidisciplinarity juxtaposes disciplines <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Transdisciplinary research may emerge from interdisciplinary collaboration, when  “fundamental epistemological shifts occur”   <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Our study engages with both of Masson’s digital humanities trends. The analysis shows how, in our project, critical tool engagement informs the collaborative brokering practice of an interdisciplinary research team. Tool user testing not only informs tool development, but also fundamentally shapes the interdisciplinary team’s negotiation practices, especially regarding what is deemed important or within the scope of the research project for each involved researcher and represented discipline. Ultimately, the analysis shows that while this project was interdisciplinary, it never transcended disciplinary concerns to realize a shared conceptual – transdisciplinary – space.</p>
<p>The research project did, however, rely on a shared material space: DIVE+, the tool that was further developed and tested within the project. Drawing into focus the brokering practices on both the tool and project levels creates a conceptual framework that is empirically, practically, observable; shared project objectives lead to tests and alterations of, and reflections on DIVE+ as a boundary object <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> or a  “working artefact”   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>). Boundary objects are defined as objects  “both adaptable to different viewpoints and robust enough to maintain identity across them”   <sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We work in line with Rieder and Rohle’s (<a href="#rieder2012">2012</a>) argument that interdisciplinary digital humanities research should  “establish areas of collaboration between the disciplines and to foster the development of practical solutions for interaction”   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> at the level of methodology. We analyse documented team meetings, and methodological and technological choices that flowed from these meetings as brokering practices to better understand how such an area of collaboration was formed in action. The team collectively documented meetings in a shared online file as part of project management efforts. The content of this file underlines that interdisciplinary collaboration requires a constant eagerness to engage in brokering practices.</p>
<p>Here, brokering work takes the shape of translation<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> ; of finding words to express concepts and translating these into a set of interface and data requirements. Recognizing translations as negotiations between disciplinary perspectives, and revisiting documentation of interactions between members of different disciplines through the conceptual lens of brokering, enables us to trace the work that goes into realizing interdisciplinary collaboration within digital humanities projects, and the work that goes into fine-tuning a technological artefact.</p>
<h2 id="22-the-boundary-object-dive-exploratory-search-and-narrative-creation">2.2 The boundary object DIVE+: Exploratory search and narrative creation</h2>
<p>Drawing out this brokering work shows how collaborators work across disciplines by material engagement with the tool DIVE+ as a boundary object. DIVE+ is an open linked exploratory search browser that facilitates the exploration of diverse archival and museum collections, and allows researchers to investigate how different media objects, events, people and concepts can be compared, connected, and contextualized. Within Library and Information Sciences, the process of information search and retrieval has been described as consisting of different phases, including exploration. Kuhlthau proposes a six-stage model of information searching, that relates search stages to phases of uncertainty, and observes that  “the model reveals a search process in which a person is seeking meaning in the course of seeking information”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Exploration is described as the third stage, in which a searcher experiences a dip of confidence after having selected a number of interesting sources. Exploration leads to feelings of uncertainty, as a user encounters sources that do not  “fit smoothly with previously held constructs”   <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Exploration and exploratory search are investigatory activities triggered by a user’s need and willingness to learn and develop new knowledge <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. White and Roth furthermore emphasize that exploratory searchers  “aim to solve complex problems”  and that exploratory search itself is  “open-ended, persistent, and multi-faceted”  (<a href="#white2009">2009</a>). Exploratory search can therefore be regarded as an iterative process, likened to solving puzzles <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> or playing games <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In defining how to optimally support exploratory search, Marchionini (<a href="#marchionini2006">2006</a>) describes a system much like DIVE+ that affords user exploration and visualization of relationships between different entities and data facets (topic, time, space, data format). DIVE+ aspires to create ‘search narratives’ by presenting for instance events that are shared across linked data sets. However, as we will discuss in the analysis section, the mismatch between the search narratives afforded by DIVE+’s use of LOD and humanities scholars’ understanding of ‘narrative’ demonstrates the precarity of transdisciplinary presumptions.</p>
<h2 id="23-exploration-afforded-by-linked-open-data">2.3 Exploration afforded by Linked Open Data</h2>
<p>Facilitating data exploration by means of linked open data (LOD) allows users to discover connections across linked data sets <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. Transposing and matching vocabularies of different data collections grants insights into individual collections as well as enable the definition of new research questions about hitherto digitally unconnected materials. Of course, providing new ways to explore these afforded connections relies on translations grounded in specific assumptions. First, there is invisible but very real work done at the data level to translate collections into LOD: adapting explorable entities to facilitate connections across different collections. Second, the notion that LOD will allow new discoveries, or the formulation of new research questions (prompted by surprising visualised connections), is based on the conviction that patterns in data lead to new knowledge <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> and that knowledge is no longer entity-centric, but rather, relationship-centric <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup><sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> .</p>
<p>Recent digital humanities research has also focused on discovery by means of exploratory search. Jähnichen et al. (<a href="#jahnichen2017">2017</a>) focus on visual topic modelling of large collections of historical digitised materials to enhance exploratory search processes, while Muiser (<a href="#muiser2017">2017</a>) employed user-centred design case studies to optimize exploration of digital cultural heritage collections. The possibilities explicitly offered by LOD are furthermore documented by Lampert and Southwick (<a href="#lampert2013">2013</a>) who argue that LOD will not only change search processes, but also shift (librarian) skills and the conception of access to digital collections.</p>
<p>This article presents the results of our user study focused on exploratory search and LOD, while connecting user study insights to overarching observations made about interdisciplinary collaboration in terms of brokering practices. We are not only interested in how users can form new research questions and encounter research ideas as they engage in exploratory search with LOD, but also draw attention to a parallel between LOD and interdisciplinary collaboration. Exploring LOD is similar to exploring interdisciplinary research possibilities; both happen between what Klein refers to as the Boundary Object and the Interactional Expertise Trading Zones, that include linguistic exchanges generating  “interlanguage and interactional expertise”   <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Mapping and transposing vocabularies across digital heritage collections and making these vocabularies explorable via the DIVE+ browser marks collaborations within both zones at the same time. DIVE+ becomes a boundary object for these collections (at the data level), while also performing the function of boundary object for the collaborating disciplines. The zone of interactional expertise is engaged by addressing user interactions with the browser. LOD allows new unforeseen connections between entities and documents. Meanwhile, interdisciplinary collaborations are expected to link and connect disciplinary ideas. On both levels, there are of course also challenges and obstacles to the fruition of these new connections. The present study details these to provide insights at both the project and interdisciplinary level.</p>
<h2 id="3-methodology">3. Methodology</h2>
<h2 id="31-documenting-collaboration">3.1 Documenting collaboration</h2>
<p>Digital humanities research is often project-based <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Project management therefore plays an important role, also when analysing how collaboration is structured. The object of the research pilot was to investigate how DIVE+ supports exploratory search practices of media researchers, especially when these researchers investigate narrative creation about unexpected media events, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. User insight would lead to recommendations to further fine-tune the browser.</p>
<p>The project team, consisting of eight researchers from the fields of Computer Science, Media Studies, and Information Science, met virtually on a bi-weekly basis to discuss project deliverables, tool development, planned user studies, and research insight dissemination efforts. Meetings lasted between 30 and 60 minutes, and were documented in an online shared document. This shared document served as a research diary, chronicling the research project’s issues, concerns, and milestones in a bi-weekly rhythm. This document is analysed to discern recurring themes, ideas, and joint research objectives in order to help understand how the team gave meaning to DIVE+ as the project’s boundary object.</p>
<h2 id="32-user-research-documenting-user-stories-to-understand-exploratory-search-with-linked-data">3.2 User research: documenting user stories to understand exploratory search with linked data</h2>
<p>Research diaries were also part of the mixed-methods approach used to undertake user research. A total of 122 (digital) humanities scholars took part in these studies, between May 2017 and January 2018. A number of methods were combined to triangulate results; individually, users were given exploratory search tasks, answered surveys and (post-task) questionnaires about their experiences. This was combined with collaborative tasks, where small groups worked together to create posters about their search experiences and their ideas about exploratory search. User studies were conducted by means of interactive workshops hosted at different universities to include the users’ actual work settings.</p>
<p>The tasks were performed on personal laptops or university computers. During two sessions, the tasks were accompanied by think-aloud protocols which were recorded and subsequently transcribed. Search histories were saved and exported by the user and users filled out a post task questionnaire. In other sessions, tasks were not accompanied by a think-aloud protocol, but by a questionnaire. This was done to not disturb other users in the room, as they were completing tasks in a single, larger, space.</p>
<p>The task assignment was followed by a focus group discussion. During the discussion, users shared their experiences of searching with exploratory search tools, including DIVE+. These sessions were concluded with a poster session. Users worked together in small groups of 3-4 people to draw their research process and trajectory. The main question they all worked with was: How would you visualize your research journey, and what is the (ideal) role of exploratory search in this process? During plenary sessions posters were discussed and research findings displayed (Figure 1).</p>

<h2 id="4-analysis">4. Analysis</h2>
<p>The first part of the analysis focuses on the research team’s brokering and translation work and then thus turns to how this work was informed by user research insights. These insights formed part of the team’s shared goals, but also became the space in which different research interests and negotiations came to the fore. Lastly, the analysis draws on insights about the collaboration and user research to focus on the necessity of both theoretical interdisciplinary discussions and their empirical, practical application when doing digital humanities work.</p>
<h2 id="41-collaboration-affects-knowledge-production-interactional-expertise-brokering-and-translation">4.1 Collaboration affects knowledge production; interactional expertise, brokering and translation</h2>
<p>The interdisciplinary research team met virtually 27 times on a bi-weekly basis between March 2017 and July 2018. This team consisted of two computer scientists, one information scientist, and two media studies scholars. A data scientist and programmer joined the bi-weekly team meetings on a more ad-hoc basis. Team discussions focused on project goals: (1) how to execute user testing with the DIVE+ browser in order to better understand how (digital) humanities scholars can use exploratory search tools as part of their research practices; (2) how to optimize the DIVE+ browser in terms of its user interface (UI) and its integration into the overarching CLARIAH Media Suite; and (3) tool and project dissemination efforts at conferences and in publications.</p>
<p>Meeting minutes were shared within the team, and archived online. These minutes serve as an overview of the project, project management, and are an artefact onto itself. A grounded analysis of these minutes shows that discussions were for instance not primarily about DIVE+’s UI, but also focused on project management (to indicate, of the 239 coded lines, 50 were labelled ‘project management’, only superseded by 51 times that the UI was topic of discussion).</p>
<p>At a first glance, this interdisciplinary collaboration focused on discussing project timelines, deliverables and key milestones. Issues with DIVE+ functionality, testing and its integration into the Media Suite were also discussed at length. Following Klein, and Star and Griesemer, DIVE+ was the project’s boundary object and its trading zone of interaction from the outset. Discussions revolved around how to investigate the ways in which DIVE+ supports exploration, how to translate insights about use into browser and interface changes, and how to disseminate research insights more broadly (discussed 24 times during the 27 meetings).</p>
<p>Klein discusses the  “interactional expertise trading zone”  where  “interdisciplinary work includes linguistic exchange that generates interlanguage and interactional expertise”   <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. In the team meetings, this exchange centred around discussing the possibilities of LOD, and how users could be asked to reflect on the usefulness of LOD via the DIVE+ search browser. Specifically, what methods could be used to understand user engagement with DIVE+, and how users understand the tool and LOD?</p>
<p>The team settled on a mixed-method approach that used exploratory search tasks and think-aloud protocols (used more commonly in human computer interaction studies), as well as research diaries and focus groups (that are employed more readily in qualitative social science and humanities research). The mixed-method approach relied on the team’s collective expertise. This is not trivial: specific experts are involved in the project because they are experts in specific user research methodologies, and are willing to contribute this expertise for the project’s collective benefit. Conversely, these methods were also chosen because these specifically helped the involved researchers translate project insights into new knowledge for dissemination within their respective fields.</p>
<p>Translating the findings from the user studies into requirements for DIVE+ necessitated another step in the collaboration process, in which interdisciplinary collaboration led to clashes in epistemological outlook and understanding. For example, the tensions over the meaning and use of the term ‘narrative’ between researchers based in the humanities and those in computational science exemplify the type of translation problems that can arise during interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
<p>Whereas the media studies researchers relied on thick descriptions of what ‘narrative’ means to the users in order to reflect on the role of narrativization in research practices, their user study work also needed to lead to user interface recommendations, as well as recommendations for the overarching Media Suite. In other words, user feedback and reflections had to be translated into material suggestions, as per the project’s objectives. A clear example of this are the team discussions about and the understanding of what ‘narrative’ means in the context of users’ research practices within DIVE+, and what this difference in meaning-attribution means in terms of interface functionality and design. For instance, not all users that partook in the user studies were comfortable with the notion that they create narratives while doing research. As one (media) historian notes:  “I believe that the narrative metaphor does not really apply to my research, because I do not produce sequential data, but rather a meta-structure, which cannot be told as a story”  (Respondent B-P17) . Yet for media researchers who are interested in audio-visual production processes, such as image researchers, creating narratives is part of their core research work. Narrative is thus a multi-interpretable container term that cannot easily be translated in a one-size fits all UI.</p>
<p>On the level of the search browser, the developers of DIVE+ referred to generated exploration paths as ‘search narratives’, as these ‘retell’ the user’s search history. This, however, lead to user misunderstandings over how they can become storytellers without being able to annotate, add, or shuffle the search results within the exploration path. For the humanities researchers on the interdisciplinary team, ‘narrative’ was also closely connected to the desire to meaningfully edit or comment upon search results. The humanities scholars struggled to view ‘auto-generated narratives’ as research stories; without a way to add an interpretation to the narrative, the humanities users felt a lack of agency over the research narrative.</p>
<p>To the involved information and computer scientists however, the concept of ‘narrative’ was irrevocably tied to a user’s search history. Ultimately, the research team’s media scholars suggested to change this notion of a ‘search narrative’ to a ‘search journey’, thereby preventing future misunderstandings between team members and between the team and the test users. The dispute over a term like ‘narrative’ shows that developing a shared vocabulary means discussing disciplinary differences.</p>
<p>A similar discussion emerged about the idea of how DIVE+ was to be an ‘event-centric’ browser. Initially, the browser included the option to search for events. However, in large part because of the ambiguity of this concept (when is something an event?), this idea was eventually abandoned. Discussions over terms such as ‘narrative’ and ‘event’ were followed up with a collective re-interpreting or translating of the term from the point of view of the users, in order to make alterations to the search browser and UI that would reflect this user interpretation and to avoid what has been referred to as the  “I-methodology”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>, where  “designers consider themselves as representative of the users”   <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This translation work is part of the brokering that the collaborating researchers engaged in. Beyond translation, brokering also means convincing the other team members of how users seemed to interpret their interactions with DIVE+ and with LOD. In this case, the discussions about the meaning of ‘narrative’ and ‘event’ that users attributed to these terms gained more agency in the brokering practice: the epistemological outlook and interpretations of the users involved in tool testing became key to material or technological changes in the browser. The data that was collected as part of the user studies becomes part of an interactional expertise trading zone; it is not only DIVE+ that connects the members of the research team as a boundary object, but also the data that is collected about DIVE+ and its use (and possible subsequent analysis of that data to publish about the project!) that gives the team discussions, and decisions, its momentum. This data is also part of the negotiation. In order to zoom in further on how this negotiation actually took shape, we now turn to a close analysis of how our collected user research data shaped the interdisciplinary collaborative work.</p>
<h2 id="42-usertool-interactions-linked-data-and-exploratory-search-user-insights-as-part-of-interdisciplinary-brokering">4.2 User/tool interactions: Linked Data and Exploratory Search user insights as part of interdisciplinary brokering</h2>
<p>Using DIVE+, users can explore relations between 1,231.688 entities from 4 digital or digitized heritage collections<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  when they use DIVE+. Links between entities are visualized by showing a snapshot of the retrieved ‘media object’, descriptions of the media object, the people, locations, and concepts linked to that entity, and how these can be further explored. Users can collect data by adding an entity of interest to their ‘exploration path’, or by bookmarking the entity for further investigation. They can subsequently save, load and export their exploration paths into their overarching CLARIAH personal ‘workspace’ to be able to peruse these throughout their research process.</p>
<p>Users saw benefits in using DIVE+ to explore collections, and recognized its potential to support the discovery of new research ideas and topics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>DIVE+’s way of linking information allows you to start with a wide search term and then click through to other or related aspects of it. It enables some free association, which can trigger research questions</em><br>
(Respondent A-G2) <br>
<em>[It] makes source selection a bit more random, giving the researcher a chance to find sources that other methods might not reveal</em><br>
(Respondent X-P12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The DIVE+ interface allows users to search for keywords, persons, and locations within 4 collections. Clicking on a search result provides a more detailed description of an entity, or, for example, allows the user to play the audio-visual file that contains the search query. This gives, as one user reports, searching with DIVE+, a sense of  “just diving in without knowing what you will end up with”  (Respondent B-P12). The fact that connections between entities are made visible is one of the described strengths of the browser, as it  “lets you see connections and thus shows you the meaning of AV content”  (Respondent A-P18).</p>
<p>Connections are deemed valuable when they can be contextualized; researchers see the tool as useful to gain a quick overview of how entities are related, and what kinds of materials are accessible and related to particular search queries. At the same time, they miss context to ground the material as  “real connections still have to be made in an old and traditional way… in the mind of the researcher. (&hellip;) It is more about the metadata than about the actual content”  (Respondent B-P2). Users also indicate that while the browser could potentially spark new research questions, this is hampered by the lack of transparency about  <em>why</em>  certain entities are related: DIVE+’s UI does not inherently explicate the connections it draws across LOD entities for the user. This also relates to questions that arose in the focus group discussions after using DIVE+: how are entities labelled as events in the tool, what is an event? Based on the user feedback, the DIVE+UI was adapted to give users the possibility to contextualize data by sorting search results by collection. This affords users a clearer view of what they are exploring.</p>
<p>The user-reported need to ground the data, whether within the context of collection, historical parameters, or a particular label (as a ‘concept’, for example), mirrors boyd and Crawford’s insights about Big Data analysis (<a href="#crawford2013">2013</a>). Without context, data loses its meaning:  “The ability to represent relationships between people as a graph does not mean that they convey equivalent information”   <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The overall responses of the users indicate that DIVE+ could potentially support exploration, because it offers an alternative way to interact with different data collections. However, users also felt that the tool lacks direct research benefits because searching with DIVE+ is time consuming, has a steep learning curve, and its search functions are counter-intuitive. Users further questioned what kind of knowledge is afforded by linked data. We will expand on this last observation, because it directly mirrors our findings about brokering as translation and consensus-making within interdisciplinary work.</p>
<p>One of the premises of DIVE+ is that, by offering exploration of entities across 4 different collections, researchers may encounter materials in new ways, which will allow researchers to ask new questions. This idea was supported by user feedback, as exploratory search is deemed to  “[allow] the adaptation of research questions in an iterative fashion”  (Respondent A-P1). However, exploration is limited by the knowledge graph that these collections, together, create. In other words, search is limited by the ways in which entities have been made discoverable, and how these have been labelled (e.g., as persons). The micro-granularity of search that is afforded by linked data would seem to allow more fine-grained search results. Yet, for the users this meant that they became more sceptical of what they were finding. Who, after all, is doing the labelling? In other words, apart from voicing a need for (collection) context to be able to interpret what they were seeing, users were questioning the transparency of the search results, and who was defining terms and setting boundaries around these objects. Within DIVE+ and interdisciplinary research alike, the tensions manifested within the boundaries of the conversation as much as within its content.</p>
<h2 id="421-negotiations-the-role-of-visualization-in-narrative-creation">4.2.1 Negotiations: The role of visualization in narrative creation</h2>
<p>The visualized exploration path, or search narrative (Figure 2), was deemed helpful to keep track of what was found before and to trace how users came to certain materials. Users could see the potential usefulness of this feature, especially to revisit previously examined materials.</p>

<p>However, as stated previously, referring to the collected search history as a narrative seemed less intuitive to the users than referring to this feature as a search journey. The actual narrative, it was deemed, is related to the historical narrative that the user is trying to form about a set of events in the past. Yet, users saw possibilities to enhance the exploration path functionalities by incorporating the possibility to add annotations; adding notes about how the user sees connections between two suggested linked entities enables the researcher to feel that they are creating narratives. Key to this understanding of narrative creation is the sense that annotation gives the user the  “powerful tool and an important strategy not only to tell events, but above all to interpret them and therefore to attribute meaning, relevance and to understand reality with more awareness and to transform it”  (Respondent E-P7) . Giving researchers the agency to annotate created exploration paths into narratives more readily integrates the tool into existing research processes. This could be useful as  “during the process of collecting data, the narrative might change, for media researchers might find information that changes their research question and primary focus”  (Respondent E-P7).</p>
<p>What the above observations indicate about how exploratory search offered by LOD affects knowledge production, is that knowledge production needs to be grounded in a clear context. The user studies show that (digital) humanities scholars greatly value visualizations of historical events in narratives, but still struggle with contextualizing the linked data presented in DIVE+. Adding user-generated annotations to the suggested connections between LOD entities will benefit their contextualization, as it would allow users to reflect on the entity, its source, and role within a possible research narrative.</p>
<p>The user insights about the exploratory search afforded by DIVE+ and the visual representations of the search narrative or journey culminated in three tool recommendations that were devised by the authors, to allow for annotation of search results (to contextualize findings), to allow the export of search results so that a user can keep these as ‘notes’ during research, and to add a feature that allows users to shuffle search results in the search narrative. These features have been designed and implemented in the newest iteration of DIVE+; user research insights thus informed particular changes to the browser to ensure the tool aligns better with research and meaning-making practices of its foreseen users.</p>
<h2 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The objective of this article was to show how insights into the exploratory search behaviour of (digital) humanities scholars with the DIVE+ browser informed the brokering work of the interdisciplinary research team. The article also argues that successful interdisciplinary collaboration requires disciplinary recognition if it is to be considered a fruitful endeavour. The presented user study insights are a springboard for answers to related questions about knowledge production - and recognition - in the digital humanities. The insights help clarify how the research team project management efforts and collective user study analysis worked to negotiate meaning, methods and outcomes on both the level of the tools’ user interface and on the level of interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
<p>The user insights culminated in team discussions about how to further refine the concept of narrative in DIVE+. These discussions articulate the important role of critical interdisciplinary dialogue in digital humanities research throughout tool development and application. The recommendations primarily focused on refining DIVE+ to give the user a better sense of data context, as well as suggestions to improve user interaction and experience with the tool’s exploration path (visualizing the search narrative, or, as the scholars agreed to term it, the search journey of the user). Figure 3 and 4 show what these incremental changes look like in the current version of the tool.</p>

<p>While these alterations were the result of user recommendations, they also reflect the outcome of the research team’s brokering - negotiation and translation - work.</p>
<p>On the level of the tool DIVE+, the user studies therefore show that (digital) humanities scholars greatly value visualizations of events in narratives, but struggle with contextualizing the linked data presented in DIVE+. Granting users more agency in the creation of narratives, by allowing them to annotate related entities in the interface’s exploration path, is expected to support this contextualization process. On the level of collaboration between disciplines, the case shows that interdisciplinarity necessitates the ability to work together in a transdisciplinary manner. This means that interdisciplinary collaboration requires the forming of a shared conceptual or even community practice in which brokering takes the shape of not only discussing and negotiating about project management and deliverables, but also requires an almost literal translation of epistemological considerations, in this case about the meaning of a term such as ‘narrative’ or ‘event’.</p>
<p>Overall, this then demands that researchers act in a self-reflexive manner throughout collaborations: sharing explicit awareness of how their disciplinary background shapes methodological considerations, their understanding of what is considered to be knowledge, and how the practice of collaborating shifts or does not shift these understandings. Masson’s observation that transdisciplinary work demands a  “shared conceptual framework”   <sup id="fnref2:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> seems fitting here, with the additional observation that creating this framework demands active and open ‘exploration’ within the interdisciplinary team. In the interactional expertise trading zone, researchers from different disciplines need to broker their views, methods, and terminology, to reach consensus and move forward. The interdisciplinary dialogue around the boundary object DIVE+ gave meaning to this collaboration; without continuous brokering work, this project would not have led to fruitful insights about the user interface of DIVE+, about users’ perceptions of meaning-creation that are afforded by linked data, or about the collaboration itself.</p>
<p>Yet, solely focusing on DIVE+ as a boundary object overlooks the important role played by the process of developing interactional expertise, of engaging in boundary work required to realize project deliverables that include an optimized exploratory search browser as a boundary object. The object seems to, also in project deliverables, take on a larger role: the tool is at the centre of conference presentations and publications, whereas the joint discussions and the collaborative work in producing the object are seemingly left aside. Tool development and project deliverables trump reflections about process. Admittedly, this seems inherent to work on any kind of research project. This is also why we feel it is important to connect a focus on (technical) deliverables to how the interdisciplinary team executed their project. While this focus on deliverables and tool recommendation realization seems to align with earlier mentioned ideas about digital humanities as a ‘neoliberal field’ that is focused on computation and the development of tools for tools’ sake, the project also illustrates that interpretation and reflections on interpretation matter within projects such as these. In the end,  “it’s not what the software does, it’s what the user does”   <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Analysing the work that goes into boundary work provides an opportunity to pick apart the fabric of much-valued interdisciplinary collaboration, to help pinpoint how researchers from different disciplines can understand one another.</p>
<p>We would like to conclude with the observation that there is an interesting parallel between the technological affordances of LOD and interdisciplinary digital humanities research. Clearly, semantics play a decisive role in both: linked data allows for semantic linking of entities, and transdisciplinary collaboration is about brokering and translating terms and meanings in such a manner that the entire group understands something in a similar way. Drawing out how this interdisciplinary brokering takes shape in practice requires working towards a sociology of digital humanities; mapping interdisciplinary exchanges in practice. This, in turn, will also bolster an understanding of how semantic connections and linked data can further enrich knowledge creation and collaboration.</p>

<p>India is a multilingual society with hundreds of years of continuous literary traditions in dozens of languages, some stretching as far back as two and a half millennia. We use India here not only to refer to the contemporary nation-state but also to the greater Indian subcontinent, taking note of the complex, overlapping territorial histories of the premodern Hind or Hindustan, the des or desh,  British India, and Cold War South Asia. Additionally, we acknowledge the interconnectedness of India and its diaspora — the world&rsquo;s largest — with other regions. For any project on Indian literature(s), it makes more sense to speak of multiple literary traditions instead of one. When we speak of Indian poetics, we are actually referring to the longstanding traditions of poetics in what come to be understood in the modern period as distinct literary traditions in multiple languages, such as Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu among many others, which cumulatively stand for Indian Literature(s). While the specificities of literary traditions are of interest in themselves, we choose to emphasize commonalities and interactions in various poetic traditions of modern Indian languages by reading them comparatively.</p>
<p>Indian literature, imagined this way, is an enormously broad conception that demands philological skills that exceed the capacity of any single individual. Therefore, for our research project, we started with Hindi and Urdu, two languages with which our larger research group, consisting of students and faculty in India and the United States, generally felt some familiarity. These languages have an entangled yet estranged relationship, and they are the two Indian languages, other than English, that our multilingual team knows the best. It is not unusual in India for a person to know two or three languages well enough to share in these literary traditions partially. Languages such as Punjabi and Bengali have some common sources of vocabulary and generally similar grammars to Hindi and Urdu but are written in different scripts with varying pronunciations. Other languages, such as Malayalam, have, in addition to script and phoneme differences, fully divergent grammars — Dravidian rather than Indo-Aryan — though they also incorporate some common sources, such as Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Hindi and Urdu share a common ancestry: the North Indian speech of the Delhi area. Literary histories of Urdu and Hindi name this common ancestor as Hindi/Hindui/Hindavi. But they note, this name could be Persian for  “Indian”  or any language spoken in India ( <em>Hind</em> ). Even though the literary language around Delhi began to put  “undue — and sometimes even almost mindless emphasis on ‘correct’ or ‘standard, sanctioned’ speech in poetry and prose”  sometime in the eighteenth century, perhaps due to the growing prestige of Persian, it was the British bias in language policy that eventually led to the separation of the North Indian speech into two separate languages defined along religious lines <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The gulf only widened further in the late 19th century, when a Hindi-language movement led to the development of Modern Standard Hindi. The movement fashioned Hindi as the language of Hindus by embracing Sanskrit-derived vocabulary and disparaging Urdu and its literature as foreign to South Asia because of its Persian language elements and metaphors <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Tied primarily to the ambitions of identity formation in the emerging struggles of nationalism, as well as the economic competition that was a consequence of colonial linguistic policy in Colonial North India, Hindi and Urdu were reconceptualized as representing different religious identities <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. That separation saw its highpoint during the partition of British India and continues to reverberate across South Asia today. We believe that the intimate yet fraught nature of the history that these languages share provides a fruitful ground for comparisons.</p>
<p>Our collaborative project between the Department of English at Jamia Millia Islamia and Michigan State University, titled  “Digital Apprehensions of Indian Poetics,”  is supported by India&rsquo;s Ministry of Education’s Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC), which aims to facilitate academic and research collaboration between higher education institutes in India and abroad. This new collaboration facilitates data-intensive textual studies in Indian languages by creating machine-readable, genre-specific corpora and by curating datasets of annotations. We attend to the specific conditions of Indian and South Asian languages, for which there are few scholarly digital editions and where access to computing is often minimal, even at research institutes and universities <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Our goal is to create digital editions based on minimal computing principles for use by scholars, the public, and students and teachers in the classroom, as well as for ingestion in information systems. This involves creating corpora using optical character recognition (OCR) and adapting existing digital resources, which include those developed by passionate individuals based outside of the academy, or citizen scholars. Therefore, we aim to facilitate the study of texts by the general public, as well as professional scholars. Additionally, we aim to build a vocabulary to document, interpret, analyze, and visualize these textual corpora using linked open data, visualizations, and keywords. Throughout our work, we presume a multilingual audience and aim to facilitate digital humanities research across Indian languages.</p>
<p>In what follows, we expound on our desired outcomes, approach, and architecture. As noted above, we aim to develop digital critical editions and datasets of annotations, including poetic keywords. We approach corpora development as a form of making rooted in the principle of  <em>jugaad</em> , a North Indian term for reuse and innovation in the presence of constraints. We conclude with a description of the minimal computing architecture that we have adopted for our publishing, editing, and annotation work. We present an architecture that can be accessed across Indian languages — starting with Hindi, Urdu, and English — using minimal computational resources. Finally, we conclude with a note on plain text and the promise it holds for data-intensive textual studies in Indian languages.</p>
<h2 id="critical-editions-and-keywords-for-indian-poetics">Critical Editions and Keywords for Indian Poetics</h2>
<p>Critical editions have long been a central component of traditional humanities, primarily for framing our  “perception of history, literature, art, thinking, language”  by establishing  “reliable sources for research”  and authorizing and canonizing  “certain readings”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Digital critical editions add a new suite of possibilities, including  “interactivity, multimedia, hypertext, and immaterial and highly dynamic (or fluctuating) ways of representing content,”  which are absent from printed critical editions <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The digital paradigm renders the static text of a printed critical edition into a  “laboratory where the user is invited to work with the text more actively,”  with the help of integrated features and tools  “allowing for customization, personalization, manipulation and contribution”   <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Harnessing the networked nature of computation, we envision developing a digital platform for scholarly collaboration in publishing. Our goal is to curate and annotate critical editions of individual poets&rsquo; works, while providing critical bibliographies to facilitate research and appreciation.</p>
<p>Through such digital critical editions, our aim is not merely to  “bring the past into the future,”  but also to furnish it for newer modes of computational inquiries <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Remediating the text not only breathes life into discussions of Indian poetics but also makes the works of a variety of poets more easily accessible to scholars and readers alike. More than that, the endeavor also enables reconsideration of questions about the very notion of the digital text and what it means to read digitally within the context of South Asian languages and literature(s).</p>
<p>We draw from Raymond Williams’ method of  “developing accounts of words as reflective essays”  for Indian poetics in order to make sense of our textual corpus <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Through a mix of distant and close reading approaches on a textual corpus derived through OCR, we hope to develop a historically informed vocabulary of poetic terms and genres that are crucial for understanding the technical field of poetry in Indian languages. We extend Williams’ keyword approach to take stock of the emergent vocabulary that continues to displace established frameworks in the humanities, especially as a consequence of shifting media paradigms. Our objective with the fundamental vocabulary of poetic traditions is not to focus on  “fixing (their) definition” ; rather, like Williams, we hope to explore the complex uses of a variety of conceptual categories to convey the contested nature of their meanings as clearly and succinctly as possible <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. When we speak of a fundamental vocabulary, we are obviously presupposing the existence of a canon, and our plan is to foreground the basic implications of the accepted canon in respected literary traditions as much as it is to explore the marginal.</p>
<p>While we want to make this resource accessible to a general audience, we are also keen on designing it for use by specialists and teachers and students in the classroom, as well as in computational or traditional research, by providing a snapshot of the historical evolution of the semantic fields associated with these terms. While the historical variations of meaning might not be as evident for topics pertaining to prosody, we believe this might be particularly useful for pinning down both the  “history of words and the contestation of their meanings”  for technical poetic vocabularies in different literary traditions over generations, eras, and epochs, acknowledging their discontinuities, ruptures, erasures, and reconstructions, especially in moments of political and social upheaval <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="making-digital-corpora-for-indian-languages">Making Digital Corpora for Indian Languages</h2>
<p>Because of the absence of existing Indian language digital corpora, especially for literary texts, making became a necessary component of our research. Making has undoubtedly been central to digital humanities and, as recent debates on the issue have clarified, doesn’t necessarily have to begin from scratch but instead can start  “in media res”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. This conception of making — rooted in collaboration, sharing, sustainability, and improvising upon what already exists while critically attending to the specificities of the localities where such making is taken up — focuses on maintaining or remaking instead of reinventing the wheel. Such critical making, in Matt Ratto’s sense of the term, not only opens the disciplinary boundaries of digital humanities for introspection but also enriches it by drawing upon practices unfamiliar in its predominantly Anglo-American roots.</p>
<p>For us, critical making also entails localization, whereby we hope to develop, reuse, and repurpose open-source tools and technologies for the particularities of Indian languages and scripts. Our conception of making is rooted in  <em>jugaad</em> , an intrinsically Indian way of making do, as Pankaj Sekhsaria describes, by  “reconfiguring materialities”  of existing tools to  “overcome obstacles and find solutions”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Our conception of  <em>jugaad</em> , which leans less towards engineering than bricolage, is intrinsically tied to localization, and because of this, we inhabit a position closer to a bricoleur than to an engineer. We see our labor as bricolage, in the sense that Claude Lévi-Strauss articulates: using what&rsquo;s at hand, we design new tools by redeploying a finite set of heterogeneous tools in contexts for which they were not originally designed, in turn not only extending the intended applications of these tools, but also renewing or enriching the stock of tools for future use <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. For Sekhsaria,  _jugaad _ underlies every conversation on technological innovation in India,  “particularly north of the Vindhya Mountain Range,”  which refers to the territories associated with the Indo-Aryan languages in which the word occurs, and testifies to the prevalence of this word in a large Indian populace, given that the Vindhya Mountain Range essentially splits the country in half <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Analyzing  _jugaad _ as a techno-myth — alongside other cultural practices of making in the Global South that Ernesto Oroza would deem  “technological disobedience”   <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> — Kat Braybrooke and Tim Jordan contrast the element of necessity in  <em>jugaad</em>  with the element of leisure and choice in the maker movement in the West <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. This notion of necessity in  <em>jugaad</em>  is also central to Padmini Ray Murray and Chris Hand’s account of making culture in Indian digital humanities, wherein they advocate for a critical dialogue between academic practices and local modes of making <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.  <em>Jugaad</em> , then, as a quintessential Indian practice, is primarily to make-do in response to resource constraints. To borrow from Oroza,  “misery is not an alternative”  for us, as we are motivated to engage with hybrid means to achieve our scholarly objectives <sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For example, our initial efforts to localize open-source OCR tools for Indian languages take advantage of two ongoing development efforts in France and Germany. First, we focus on creating ground truth corpora to provide accurate transcriptions for training and testing of both automatic text recognition (ATR) and automatic layout analysis (ALA) models for historical documents in Indian languages using eScriptorium. eScriptorium is an open-source tool, currently under development for hand-written text recognition (HTR) at École Pratique des Hautes Études, Université Paris Science et Lettres (EPHE – PSL), that adapts well for bidirectional scripts. It enables easy application of state-of-the-art neural networks for transcribing and annotating historical documents using an intuitive graphical user interface in modern web browsers. Developed as part of the Scripta project<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> , it integrates the Kraken engine for OCR/HTR<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> , and can be installed both locally and as preconfigured Docker images <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We also draw from ongoing developments within the context of the DFG funded OCR-D project<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Although it is designed for a different context, OCR-D’s clear guidelines for transcribing and labelling ground truth in the PAGE-XML format offer us a broader framework to maintain consistency across our ground truth. More importantly, we rely on the modularity of OCR-D’s software stack for streamlining workflows best suited for our documents. OCR-D maintains, builds, and repackages a collection of open-source projects in the form of what they call modules. These modules can be painlessly installed with either Makefiles or as pre-built Docker images. Each module comes with an array of tools, which are called processors. These processors can be easily called from the command line for each task in an end-to-end OCR pipeline. Here, image data stored in a workspace or local directories can be easily exposed to either a single processor or several processors sequentially for different processing tasks through their corresponding Metadata Encoding and Transmission Schema (METS) files. Once a task is finished, the information about the processing step(s) is written to the METS file, while the processed data is saved in the respective output directory. This integrated pipeline with pre-configured dependencies becomes extremely salient and functional for the needs of our larger group.</p>
<p>Working with historical documents in different layouts and typefaces, this part of our project will create a publicly available textual corpus in Hindi and Urdu that can be further processed downstream for a host of data-driven humanistic inquiries. These include information extraction methods, such as named entity recognition. Our objective is to work primarily with publicly available digital images accessed through International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) API endpoints hosted at different cultural institutions, including the British Library and Internet Archive. Additionally, we will publish well-documented state-of-the-art OCR models in public repositories, along with their corresponding provenance and ground truth datasets, for use in further development of open source OCR for historical print in Hindi and Urdu.</p>
<p>In the absence of robust institutional support, citizen scholars around the world have done much of the work to make Hindi and Urdu texts available on the Internet. Care for languages and poetic experience has led impassioned citizen scholars to launch digital platforms such as Rekhta (Urdu), KavitaKosh (Hindi), and PunjabiKavita (Punjabi). The reach of these projects, especially Rekhta, is enormous, spanning from social media like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, to festivals and conferences, to classrooms, to more personal spaces such as family chat groups. Though these platforms provide enormous resources to scholars, their primary and intended audience is not the academy. Our collaboration intervenes here to provide access to these texts as data for an audience that includes the quotidian Indian as well as scholars, poets, information technologists, library systems, and nonhuman agents. Proper metadata is essential for such aims. Using linked open data, we incorporate citizen-scholar projects and resources into our projects as well.</p>
<p>Citizen scholarship is only one example of the changes in the portability of texts through new digital technologies. The malleability and flexibility of digital texts, coupled with their easy accessibility and reproducibility, make them increasingly desirable for scholarly inquiry. These affordances motivate our focus on the production of high-quality, accessible digital editions. While learning from community-driven initiatives by citizen-scholars, our objective is to digitally remediate the critical editions of individual poets’ corpora in Indian languages, using minimal markup schemes such as Markdown that are easy to reproduce for anyone willing to  “decode, receive, and revise”  them <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. The sharing and archiving of these digital editions draw inspiration from projects such as OpenArabicPE and OpenITI. These projects not only version plain-text data using Git but also link it to facsimiles, wherever available, with minimal markup so that scholars can review, contribute, and track changes.</p>
<p>As we will describe below, we follow this model of using plain text in human- and machine-readable Markdown files. While the interface we use to access this data may change, the form of the data, a simple text file, is remarkably versatile. The transformation from Markdown to Textual Encoding Initiative (TEI) XML, too, can be a simple and automatable procedure. However, we require additional layers of annotation, especially for poetry, as well as a multilingual interface.</p>
<h2 id="minimal-computing-approaches-to-indian-digital-texts">Minimal Computing Approaches to Indian Digital Texts</h2>
<p>Prefaced by traditions of localization and open-source activism within India, such as those of Delhi&rsquo;s Sarai program<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, we grapple with questions of software translation and localization of linguistic resources. Our focus is on plain text and the need for an interface that supports both the conceptual and practical dimensions of studying poetics in Indian languages, especially when the digital text itself, no matter how plain, is insufficient. Our Hindi and Urdu texts span alphabets and scripts — left-to-right and right-to-left, Indic, Perso-Arabic, Roman, Devanagari, and unwritten — and yet are mutually aurally comprehensible, for the most part. While we are working under constraints, we dare to dream big and use computing to get around barriers that otherwise look imposing.</p>
<p>We use Git to organize and collaboratively write and contribute to our project, as it makes both minimal dependence and minimal maintenance possible. Though used primarily to version computer code, we use Git both in software development and in our other collaborative efforts, including writing. It allows us to avoid dependency on research computing professionals or buying expensive, high-maintenance technology. Minimal computing helps us avoid the alienation of users or the fetishization of tools. While a certain amount of code goes into any GitHub or GitLab project, it makes entry into project development possible and accessible for beginners.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  As humanists, the &ldquo;making&rdquo; of Git-based projects appeals to our sensibilities. It is useful not only for not learning but also for tinkering around in a perfect  <em>jugaad</em>  fashion, using code and tools in ways that they might not have been intended for before, allowing for backtracking and trying out new branches. Git makes minimal automation possible by circumventing reliance on dedicated web servers; instead, writing and editing work can be done in one&rsquo;s local system and then committed to the central GitHub repository. This feature is particularly useful in situations where Internet access is unreliable or during power outages. Also, it uses low bandwidth, as on each update only the changes are transferred.</p>
<p>As noted, we turn to adaptation and localization of existing tools for our collaborative writing workflow instead of reinventing the wheel. Specifically, we use Jupyter Book, part of the Executable Book Project, which enables users to assemble books and articles from a combination of Markdown files, executable Jupyter Notebooks and other sources using Sphinx, the robust documentation engine developed for Python. Though originally used for collaborative computing in STEM fields, we find the executable notebook and book approach of great interest for our digital humanities work, as it allows code to be embedded alongside text. Sharing the source files allows for one team member&rsquo;s work to be reviewed by others, permitting open access to any calculations and visualizations as well as the techniques used to render them. By utilizing Sphinx, Jupyter Book allows these various documents to be easily combined and cross-referenced. Like with Markdown, the text can be converted into HTML for website viewing, as well as into other formats.</p>
<p>In our workflow, we had to make some adjustments to attend to the specific requirements of Indian languages and of our multilingual audiences, as well as to the needs of our larger research group. In Unicode, the standard system used to digitally encode the world&rsquo;s writing systems, only the orthographic information about a word can be encoded. Unlike in English, there can be more than one way to write certain ligatures in both Devanagari and Nastaliq scripts, which therefore requires some normalization. Transliteration between scripts, metrical analysis, lexicography, and interfacing with information systems, however, requires additional layers. For example, there is simply not enough information outside of context to distinguish between کیا ( <em>kiyaa</em> : done) and کیا ( <em>kyaa</em> : what). For our larger group, another concern is getting their computer systems ready for the minimal computing toolkit. Though the technical requirements are few, minimal computing still requires some training and setup. Running Jupyter Book locally, for example, requires installing a number of programming languages and libraries to be installed: Python, to run the documentation-generator Sphinx, and Pandoc, a Haskell library, to generate bibliographic citations. We wanted to have the option of two different approaches: 1) to be able to sync from a locally running machine to a remote Git repository and 2) to have an alternative to syncing between a locally running server and the remote.</p>
<p>To address these issues, we took advantage of two newer developments: the JAMstack and using Git as a content management system.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  In the JAMstack, web pages are typically pre-generated and written to disk through a process referred to as Server-Side Rendering (SSR). SSR is advantageous from a search engine optimization perspective. As the web crawlers of Internet search engines visit a page, they learn not only that there&rsquo;s a page at a given address but also what its contents are. Another advantage is that pages can be loaded very quickly because the pages are pre-generated and static. Finally, these websites are usually relatively small and can often be hosted for free on GitHub, GitLab, Netlify, or other web providers.</p>
<p>While there are several popular JAMstack frameworks, all of which could have handled the tasks at hand, we were attracted to the Vue.js JavaScript framework and within it the Gridsome JAMstack framework. Vue.js recommends a &ldquo;single page component&rdquo; approach to web design, whereby code, template, and webpage style declarations are all kept together in one file. We decided to embrace this new approach, hoping it would help us get our projects going quickly. Gridsome uses Vue.js and adds additional features, such as a GraphQL (Graph Query Language) interface to query collections. It relies on plugins, which can import data from different sources. Commonly used sources include hidden or public blogs, Drupal websites, and, as in our case described below, a directory of plain text Markdown files. In addition to markup of text, Markdown files can also contain data of nearly any sort in their header. The following example shows a sample header encoded in the YAML format, a human-readable way of storing or transmitting data:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="display:flex;"><span> —- title: Bol author: Faiz Ahmed Faiz —- Bol kih lab… (Poem text is here in the  body  )
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The sample above includes a title and an author field. These fields, which usually provide metadata about the text in the body of the Markdown file, can be used to store numbers, dates, tags, and nearly any sort of data.</p>
<p>The second trend that we adopted is the move to use Git not only to write or code together but also as a content management system. Here, we used the open-source, JavaScript-based Netlify CMS, which is written using React, an alternative to Vue.js. Easily added to Gridsome and other frameworks, Netlify CMS allows users to authenticate with a Git repository — we used GitLab — and make and commit changes to the repository via a web-accessible editor page. A plugin to Gridsome adds a route to a webpage where users can edit the Markdown header fields online according to a configuration that they specify; we can determine what their content should be (e.g., dates, strings, numbers, lists of strings, or references to other nodes). Netlify CMS then handles the updates to the Git repository. As a result, we are able to have people access and update the data without requiring them to install the full JAMStack on their local computer.</p>
<p>We also knew we wanted to have certain content and data be available in Hindi, Urdu, and English. Fortunately, we were able to adapt the internationalization (i18n) features of Netlify CMS to work with those of Gridsome. Netlify CMS handles translation of Markdown header and body fields by keeping certain common fields in the default locale — we chose English (en) for this project — and by storing localized (translated) fields in other locales, as in this YAML header:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="display:flex;"><span> —- en: title: Faiz Ahmed Faiz bday: 1911.02.13 body: Urdu poet hi: title: &#34;फ़ैज़ अहमद फ़ैज़&#34; body: उर्दू शायर ur: title: فیض احمد فیض body: اردو شاعر —-
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this sample from an author collection, the field bday only appears in the default locale (en). The fields that can be translated (title and body) appear also in the Hindi (hi) and Urdu (ur) locales. Note that the body field, which followed the header in the previous Markdown header example, is now contained as a field within the header itself.</p>
<p>The Markdown file of a text can then reference its author(s) using the author field:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="display:flex;"><span> —- en: title: Bol author: - Faiz Ahmed Faiz body: |- bol kih lab aazaad hai tere bol zabaa;n ab tak terii hai hi: author: - Faiz Ahmed Faiz title: बोल body: |- बोल कि लब आज़ाद है तेरे बोल ज़बाँ अब तक तेरी है ur: author: - Faiz Ahmed Faiz title: بول body: |- بول کہ لب آزاد ہے تیرے بول زباں اب تک تیری ہے —-
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, we specify that there can be more than one author, hence that field contains a list, indicated in YAML by the hyphen. The author is referenced using the Roman version of the poet&rsquo;s name. This allows for a fully human- and machine-readable version of this document. In this way, the plain text files in the directory of a Git repository are treated as a document-oriented database. (Gridsome, in fact, uses the speedy JavaScript LokiJS database internally). When displayed, fields are presented on a webpage in accordance with the client&rsquo;s chosen locale — Hindi, Urdu, or English.</p>
<p>Through this combination of the JAMstack and a Git repository content management system, we can provide localized access not only to viewers but to our contributors, even if they are on a mobile phone or tablet without proper access to a computer. By using continuous integration — in our case, the running of a script when a commit is made to the Git repository — the website is automatically updated when changes to the content are made, and tests are run to assert that the changes are valid. Updates to the data can also be federated; by adjusting the Netlify CMS settings to use permission levels in Git, some users can automatically make changes while others require approval. These proposed changes can come from the public, too, offering a straight-forward pathway to crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>For web-based annotation, we are developing a custom widget that starts from the transcription of the text in its original script (OCRed, if appropriate) stored in the body field of a Markdown file. A genre field determines how exactly the text will be treated. In general, we address the location of the individual tokens/words by their coordinates in the Markdown file. This allows us to add multiple layers of annotation. The transcribed words are treated as phrases that can contain multiple words. A name, for example, can be a phrase, but so can a compound word. (Linguists also prefer to have some features, such as future case markers, separated.) Sentences are stored as a span of coordinates (e.g., for poetry indexed by line group, line, and phrase) after we split the original text between spaces, punctuation, and paragraphs. While editing, changes to a custom widget are mapped to a model representation of the text in the web browser and then written to disk following updates.</p>
<p>We are also able to produce a view of the text in the Textual Encoding Initiative (TEI) XML, which is widely used in digital humanities. Sentences map to TEI’s  <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>  element, phrases to the  <code>&lt;phr&gt;</code>  element, and words are its  <code>&lt;w&gt;</code>  element. In this way, we avoid the awkwardness of dealing with right-to-left text in XML editors. Individual words or phrases, moreover, can have additional views or links attached to them, such as scholarly or library-system transliteration or the International Phonetic Alphabet. Also, we can offer views of the individual sentences using the CoNLL-UL format used by Universal Dependencies (UD), a framework for grammatical annotation, allowing us to take advantage of the rich set of annotation tools developed for UD.</p>
<p>For the purposes of developing an annotated corpus, this  <em>jugaad</em>  — using the JAMstack and Git as a CMS — is sufficient. Our plain-text data is relatively small, and it can be read by humans and machines alike. We avoid hosting large image files by instead providing IIIF links to allow transcribers and developers to query the images. Using Git, changes can be tracked and undone. There are few limitations as to the data or links we can provide. For example, interfacing with citizen scholar projects or Wikidata merely requires adding additional fields. For interoperability, the Markdown header field can also approximate (to a certain extent) the graph-based Research Description Framework (RDF), which uses a subject-predicate-object (S-P-O) approach. For example, the previous example can be transformed to RDF as: poem Bol (S) hasAuthor (P) Faiz Ahmed Faiz  (O). The document or node serves as a subject; the metadata field (e.g., author:) as the RDF predicate (e.g, hasAuthor); and the value (e.g., Faiz Ahmed Faiz) as the object. In Gridsome, the entire network graph of relations is available both through the query language GraphQL and as a database. Finally, the whole system can be accessed and updated either on a local machine that has the JAMstack implemented or through a web interface to Git using Netlify CMS. While the former is especially useful for those of us doing computational analysis, the latter allows updates to be made from any phone. The data can be easily versioned and progressively archived from Git to Zenodo or other repositories, and the interface expands to meet our needs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-plain-text-for-indian-languages">Conclusion: Plain Text for Indian Languages</h2>
<p>Plain text is not only simple and dynamic in its potential but also allows authors and researchers to have more creative and scholarly freedom over their work that proprietary tools and formats often lack. If one hopes to make understanding of Indian poetics sustainable and accessible, such minimal computing approaches  “reduce the use of proprietary technologies and paywalls to increase access to content, data, and/or source files”   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Our project stresses this approach for its contributors as well as for its future audience and users. With plain text, the authors have a close relationship with their work rather than spending time, money, resources, or effort on the tool. More than that, plain text files with minimal markup have a much smaller memory size, which reduces both  “ecological cost of storage for digital preservation”  and accessibility issues for users in low bandwidth regions <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. It eliminates the underlying complex layer of code which mystifies and alienates making from the maker. Instead, it brings all the elements to the surface offering new possibilities for participation and discovery.</p>
<p>Above we have described a collaboration to enable data-intensive textual study of Indian languages. In the absence of existing digital corpora, especially literary corpora, we have turned to making our own, starting with OCR workflows. To do so, we have embraced a form of innovation under constraint by reusing or repurposing what is at hand, which is commonly referred to in North India as  <em>jugaad</em> . This process also involves sharing methodological innovations as well as data sets. Beginning with poetry in Hindi and Urdu, we have sought to develop digital critical editions as well as sets of annotations that allow for comparative study across Indian languages. We take a minimal computing approach focused on plain text, producing machine- and human-readable data. We use the JAMstack and Git as a content management system to allow for not only computational approaches to text but also to facilitate access and possibilities for contribution for those without a full computer system. Starting with left-to-right and right-to-left materials, we anticipate this approach can be expanded to other Indian languages as we continue to realize the possibilities of minimal computing for exploring Indian poetics.</p>

<p>For some practitioners, research begins in library collections or archives at the moment of contact with an object of interest. In the case of digital objects, this encounter is usually mediated by a digital asset management system. Although screens afford the allure of immediacy, the process of making digital objects available and discoverable demands a great deal of labor, from digitizing a physical object to creating metadata, to maintaining the object, to importing it into the system, and finally to presenting it.</p>
<p>We begin this essay with a case study of one such digital asset management system, called Vault, in the University of Victoria Libraries, and we focus on the work required to not only keep it running but also advance the migration process from Software as a Service (SAAS)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  to free and open-source software (FOSS).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  Vault does not seem like a typical minimal computing project. It it does not involve a static site generator, small single-board computer, or lightweight markup language; nor does it espouse a minimalist aesthetic. Yet it does inform and enact what we call  “minimal computing from the labor perspective,”  which seeks to degrow digital projects.</p>
<p>Here, our use of degrow corresponds with ongoing feminist ecological work on capitalism, labor, and care <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. For these scholars, particularly Stefania Barca and Bengi Akbulut, degrowth  “ultimately means eliminating the productive reinvestment of surplus value”   <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. For us, degrowth in the context of computing — or degrowth  _as _ minimal computing — prompts people to articulate what they need or want from a project, what work is required when, and who will do that work, all without appealing to increased efficiency or productivity. Minimal computing from a labor perspective is thus first and foremost about social relations between people, projects, and labor before minimalism is reified into a form, technique, tool, or feature. Practically, it defines an explicit endpoint to resist scope creep and potentially endless maintenance. Politically, it acknowledges and seeks to address power structures in claims to minimalism, including the hierarchies of labor they entail. In the following study of Vault, for example, we discuss how software maintenance resists binaries of masculinized programming culture (“real” technical labor) and feminized carework (devalued organizational or affective labor). Finally, there is a design angle to the labor perspective, whereby minimal computing reduces the opacity of digital projects to make labor apparent. Through methods such as annotation and pseudocode,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  it demonstrates out how computation transforms objects and information, and it demystifies projects to avoid proverbial black boxes. As is the case with Vault, minimal computing from the labor perspective eschews SAAS in favor of FOSS while recognizing and supporting the everyday labor demanded by the latter.</p>
<p>Taken together, these practical, political, and design approaches to digital projects speak to the primary aim of minimal computing from the labor perspective: to degrow computation’s alienation of practitioners from their own projects and from social organization and collective expertise. Rather than asserting this perspective and then applying it to examples, we begin with Chan’s argument, based on experience, which describes the conditions and practices that gave rise to Vault and her contributions to it. From there, we extrapolate lessons from Vault to further define and historicize minimal computing from the labor perspective and outline its real and potential effects on the habits, cultures, and values of computing.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-vault-at-the-university-of-victoria">Case Study: Vault at the University of Victoria</h2>
<p>I am one of two developers at University of Victoria Libraries (Libraries) who knows and uses Ruby on Rails.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  Ruby is a general-purpose programming language akin to Python, while Rails is a server-side framework for building web applications with Ruby. I am responsible for developing and maintaining Vault, <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  which is the Libraries’ asset management system. Written in Ruby on Rails, Vault is a custom instance of Samvera’s open-source repository software Hyku. It is further part of a multi-year, collaborative effort unfolding across occupations and groups within the Libraries, including digitization (Page DeWolfe, Leanne Gibbs, and Kathy Mercer), metadata and cataloging (Karen Dykes, Dean Seeman, Maggie Tan, and Shelley Coulombe), software development (Braydon Justice, Ethan Getty, and me), library systems (John Durno), and digital scholarship and strategy (Lisa Goddard and J. Matthew Huculak). Importantly, Vault is not the first platform the Libraries have used for asset management. Like most platforms, it arrived in the middle of our work at the University of Victoria (UVic), after we used the CONTENTdm software.</p>
<p>Changing platforms from CONTENTdm to Vault will gradually increase public access to the Libraries’ collections by reducing UVic’s use of proprietary software.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  This aspect of Vault aligns with some goals of the FOSS movement, where people  “have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. There is also a keen appetite among libraries and other memory institutions for open-source platforms. The list of Samvera adopters, for example, contains 485 organizations, including many university and college libraries as well as high-profile organizations such as the British Library and the Electronic Literature Organization <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. That number will likely increase; several institutions recently reported migrating from CONTENTdm to open-source repositories, and many institutions worldwide are facing a major open-source repository upgrade from Fedora 3 to Fedora 4-6 <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At the Libraries, switching from CONTENTdm to Vault will also help to reduce SAAS costs; however, implementing open-source software, and implementing it well, is obviously not free.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  When choosing between SAAS and FOSS, each institution should take into account their own needs, resources, and local contexts. One cost that institutions might have to bear for complex, server-side FOSS platforms is the infrastructure that supports software. They may also have to pay internal or external developers to develop, maintain, and/or migrate data to their instance of that software, and software localization may pose challenges in the process. When developers have to update FOSS, no automatic patch, built-in support, or documentation may exist for custom features designed for a particular institution. Developers such as myself thus consider each feature on a case-by-case basis to determine the best way to port the functionality from one version to the next. Sometimes this process is relatively simple (e.g., copy and pasting code that other developers have already tested), but it can also be very laborious.</p>
<p>Although maintenance is rarely discussed in research and academic publications, it is part of the routine work and decision-making processes in memory institutions such as the Libraries.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  It also points to palpable contradictions at play within project design and development, where increasing access may not reduce the labor of maintenance.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  Such tensions assert themselves when projects and institutions have limited staff and faculty, are underfunded and under-resourced, and/or face significant material constraints. Kate Dohe observes that open-source software initiatives are mostly dominated by wealthy, historically white institutions and are still relatively opaque to non-specialists <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. She adds that this disparity is compounded by tensions between the masculinized micro-culture of software development and the feminized library workforce.  “The end result,”  Dohe declares, is  “elite institutions making products for other elite institutions, and every year the technical and economic barriers to entry grow higher”   <sup id="fnref2:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. If libraries strive to support and customize software, and they recognize, as Samvera’s development team does, that contradictions between support and customization are the rule of, rather than the exception to, product and service design, then we must ask who can afford to develop and maintain FOSS <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>While Hyku may be more transparent than CONTENTdm, the technical expertise required to read or write its code nevertheless creates barriers to participation that existing governance structures often exacerbate <sup id="fnref3:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. For instance, one piece of software is composed of many different components working in concert. In the case of Vault, those components include Fedora 4 (repository software), Blacklight (discovery service), Solr (indexing software), and the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), among others.</p>

<p>My typical day can involve working with three to six types of code, depending on the task and how code is defined. Coding a single web page for Vault requires knowledge of HTML (the marked-up content of the page), CSS (the style or display), JavaScript (animation and interface elements), and Ruby on Rails (the page interacting with the server or database). Each of these languages has its own syntax and quirks while also relying or building on other languages. Programming a simple hide/show animation in JavaScript, for example, requires knowing which HTML element to animate — an element I will likely mark with a CSS selector or class before passing it into JavaScript. A task that may at the outset appear simple requires familiarity with three different languages that, in turn, require a non-trivial amount of time and labor to learn. The difficulties of this work are compounded when people are not compensated or supported for developing technical expertise, or where a lack of resources or staff means one person must juggle many separate tasks in addition to debugging software.</p>
<p>Errors and error messages are, like maintenance, largely ignored in broader discussions of technological innovation and software, except in minute conversations between developers or as lingering comment threads in forums such as Stack Overflow.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  They are unplanned interruptions and undesirable hiccups in the seamless experience of technology, and they are mostly forgotten as soon as a problem is fixed and an error disappears. But they are also ubiquitous, not to mention fundamental, to the composition of code and the maintenance of software such as Vault. Errors highlight the messiness of migration, localization, and upkeep. They emphasize how code resists exact or straightforward replication over time or across platforms. Although some code can be reused, people still need to modify it to fit a different context (e.g., renaming variables), match changes elsewhere in the software (e.g., updating to a code module needed for an existing application), or accommodate an unexpected edge case (e.g., data that does not easily fit within an existing database schema and thus requires an update to that database’s structure). Other common maintenance and debugging issues I might anticipate during a project like Vault include typos or syntax errors, libraries deprecated for performance issues or security vulnerabilities, adding or deleting columns in a database, cascading errors introduced by a bug fix, reference errors, or⁠ — worst of all — code that fails silently, without any indication of where the problem may be. Such errors are in fact so common they become banal, at least for developers.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Software development is associated mostly with writing new code; however, in practice I work with non-functioning code — that is, code that does not operate how my colleagues or I want or expect it to — as often as I do with functioning code. And I am not alone. Nathan Ensmenger notes that software maintenance is  “the single most time consuming and expensive phase of [software] development,”  representing 50-70% of total expenditures from the early 1960s to 2014 <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Code is in constant need of repair. As Ensmenger declares,  “All software has bugs; the question is simply whether [or] not they are known, and the degree to which they affect the general consensus on whether or not the software is ‘working’”   <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Ensmenger’s statement echoes research in maintenance studies that stresses the necessary but invisible and devalued acts of care and repair performed by people who keep the machine running <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The development and maintenance of Vault, like research across maintenance studies, demonstrates quite clearly why code is not  <em>logos</em> , or the one true  “source [or] . . . representation of action” : something that simply works, untouched by the messy world of people and things <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. As Wendy Hui Kyong Chun argues in  <em>Programmed Visions</em> , fetishizing source code frames it as a seamless set of instructions that propel execution without regard for the many systems, agents, and social relationships in between <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Chun writes,  “[Fetishization] assumes no difference between source code and execution, between instruction and result”   <sup id="fnref2:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. If code requires constant maintenance, then it cannot stand as a monolithic enclosed object — not only since it is always breaking down, but also because it is deeply enmeshed in social and material relations that enable it to run and continue running <sup id="fnref3:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. As Ensmenger puts it,  “software . . . is like a contract, a constitution, or a covenant”  under constant revision and negotiation <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. It is  “history, organization, and social relationships made tangible”   <sup id="fnref3:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>, especially under the SAAS paradigm, where everything from networking and storage to applications and data may be hosted and managed remotely by a company or organization. This arrangement means SAAS customers usually play little to no role in programming and maintenance decisions related to access, discovery, search, metadata, customization, and the storage limits of their project. They are  <em>here</em> , and software is  <em>there</em> . The irony, then, is that the consequences of code as  <em>contract</em>  may not differ significantly from the consequences of code as  <em>logos</em> . While they operate under distinct assumptions⁠ — code does what it says versus code is a service — both isolate code from social dimensions of its workflow. Projects such as Vault and Hyku may be understood as a response, if not a corrective, to this isolation. With them comes increased, localized attention to the contingencies of code: software moves from  <em>there</em>  to  <em>here</em> .</p>
<p>As Vault demonstrates, code and software are contingent on the needs of the Libraries’ catalogers. Responding to those needs, Justice and I implemented a CONTENTdm migrator tool, which lets catalogers map metadata terms from one system to another before exporting CONTENTdm data to a comma-separated values (CSV) file with a row for each item and its metadata. Importantly, each row contains a file path to the digital object that the metadata describes so Vault can link them together. After refining the CSV, catalogers upload it to Vault. Vault parses the CSV, ingests both the metadata and objects, and performs various other tasks, such as indexing metadata or creating thumbnails. Previously, an empty file path in the CSV would cause the entire batch upload job to fail without any notification to the uploader. So, based on feedback, Justice and I also implemented a file path checker tool that determines whether a file actually exists at the path indicated before Vault tries to import the object or metadata. The path checker then prints a list of empty paths for catalogers to correct. Accurately typing long file paths is often difficult and frustrating for people, especially if they are accustomed to graphical interfaces or different operating systems (for instance, Linux paths use forward slashes while Windows paths use backslashes). During the migration and localization processes, the Libraries are able to address some of these difficulties and frustrations through customization by way of automation, which may not be available to SAAS customers.</p>
<p>Vault’s features are also contingent on what the Libraries do not need or choose to avoid. Justice removed Hyku’s built-in notifications feature to decrease the number of internal system requests, which impede server performance. To restrict access, he also removed the option to register for an account without an explicit invitation from an administrator. I included an option for the Libraries to allow people who are not affiliated with UVic to view an item without being able to download it. Hyku’s default settings coupled viewable with downloadable, but the Libraries needed to restrict downloads for items that are in copyright or have protocols governing their use. These sorts of customizations fall under the broader umbrella of maintenance as they not only speak to the ongoing, local needs of the Libraries but also affect, or cascade across, Vault as a whole over time. Although they are quite technical in the particular cases of programming and debugging, they need to be communicated more generally to everyone in the Libraries who relies on Vault. Otherwise, code and software are once again isolated from who and what keep them running.</p>
<p>Pseudocode, or an informal description of how a computer program operates, is useful for such translation practices, and for instilling a sense of trust when labor is divided and individuals contribute only to specific parts of a platform based on their roles within the Libraries. Consider an example based on writing a Ruby on Rails web application (app). When digitizing objects such as periodicals or books for archiving purposes, the Libraries’ digitization team scans each page as a .tiff image (Tagged Image File Format, or TIFF) at about 600 dots per inch (DPI) and a file size of hundreds of megabytes each. However, people who access the Libraries’ collections may prefer to view these images as .pdf documents (Portable Document Format, or PDF) in which every image is a page. Justice, Greg Lanning, and I begin by talking with the Libraries’ digitization unit about which Ruby functions and features may help to address this issue of format needs and preferences. Then the three of us compile a list of specifications, written in rather plain language. The list may look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>People will select a folder of TIFFs (through a dialog box) on a shared library storage drive for conversion.</li>
<li>The app will ignore all non-TIFF files in this folder.</li>
<li>The app will check the DPI of each TIFF, print a warning if the TIFF is under 600 DPI, and resample the TIFF to 600 if it is above 600 DPI.</li>
<li>The resulting PDF will be linearized or “web-ready.”</li>
<li>Up to four people should be able to use the app at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>This imagined app considers the fact that converting the TIFFs to a linearized PDF is a time-consuming task that cannot be done easily through a graphical user interface (GUI). Even proprietary software such as Adobe Acrobat, which allows for some automatic conversion, will crash when given a significant number of high-quality, information-dense image files. And so, rather than jumping immediately into the Adobe Creative suite, I begin writing pseudocode for the Libraries.</p>
<p>Pseudocode enables me to draft code as a series of actions the code will perform. To increase accessibility and bypass assumptions of shared technical language, I write in prose instead of code. Linearize the PDF would, for example, be expressed in Ruby as  <code> </code>qpdf #{input_pdf_name} — linearize #{output_pdf_name}`` . Here is sample pseudocode for the specifications list above:</p>
<p>Take a folder containing TIFFs as the input.  Create a list of TIFF files to convert.  Check the DPI of each TIFF and resample, do nothing, or print a warning if necessary.  Convert each TIFF to a PDF.  Combine all the PDFs (in the correct order) into one PDF file.   Linearize the PDF and save it somewhere.   Notify the user when the process is done and allow them to download the PDF.</p>
<p>Pseudocode is important for describing what a project should or must do without becoming tangled in the particular syntax of a programming language. As intellectual work, it helps practitioners to clarify what they need and how to judge whether, how, or to what degree a resulting program succeeds. It is also advantageous from a maintenance perspective because the potential for error in digitization projects is high, and it is far easier to debug a small program (in terms of number of lines) than a large one. By avoiding resource-heavy interfaces and scope creep, and by adding complexity incrementally and only when necessary, the Libraries can thoroughly test one part of a program and confirm it is working before moving to another feature or function of Vault.</p>
<p>Along the way, I may use a “low-tech,” non-GUI interface such as a text editor, command line, or interactive shell or console called a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) when composing code. I may also draw or sketch a workflow on paper before touching a keyboard. Such interfaces narrow attention and tend to reduce complexity when testing and debugging. They focus the work on describing details concretely. What functions are needed? What do those functions need — which data types, variables, or parameters? What are some errors that could occur? What alternative functions or workarounds exist if initial attempts fail? What information is needed from people, and what can be provided, calculated, or expressed by the computer? If the Libraries are creating profiles in Vault, for example, do we need a person’s first or last name or email address? Where and how will this data be stored, used, displayed, and retrieved?</p>
<p>After writing preliminary pseudocode, I build these steps using logical statements — such as if/then clauses or loops — to guide the computer in its decision-making process. If/then statements are like forks in the road: they describe two (or more) conditions that a computer calculates and pair each condition with a specific action the computer will take if the corresponding condition is met. Loops are repeated or repeatable if/then statements. They say,  “As long as condition X is met, repeat action Y.”  For instance, I can loop through a list of files in a folder ( “for every file . . .” ). Here is the revised pseudocode for the TIFF-to-PDF conversion process, including if/then statements and loops:</p>
<p>Take a folder containing TIFFs as the input. The function needs a parameter or argument: the folder’s name. This name must be unique and unambiguous.  Create a list of TIFF files to convert based on the folder’s contents. For every file:<br>
If the file is a TIFF, then add it to a list of TIFFs.   If the file is not a TIFF, then ignore it.</p>
<pre><code>For every TIFF in the list, check the DPI of that file.
</code></pre>
<p>If the DPI is over 600, then resample it to 600 DPI.  If the DPI is equal to 600, then continue to the next file.   If the DPI is under 600, then warn the user but keep the file in the list for conversion.</p>
<pre><code>Convert each TIFF file to a PDF file.   Combine all the PDFs (in alphabetical order based on the TIFF’s original filename) into one big PDF. Each PDF becomes a page of the resulting PDF.  Linearize the PDF and save it in a folder for download.  Email the user with a link to the PDF when the process is done.   
</code></pre>
<p>After I create a pseudocode roadmap for my app, I begin to translate it into Ruby on Rails. Ruby contains a number of built-in methods: algorithms that transform some input into an output. Where possible, I look for these built-in methods as well as external code libraries (called gems in Ruby) to achieve common programming tasks such as creating, moving, or removing files. This step avoids reinventing the wheel. Why write code entirely from scratch if someone else has already created an effective approach to the problem? In some cases, writing code entirely from scratch is not reasonable. When converting a TIFF into a PDF, for example, I would have to know the byte-by-byte values of image headers (data placed at the beginning of a file that tells a viewer to parse or interpret the file as a TIFF) and replace them with PDF headers, all without corrupting the content of the file itself. In this scenario, programmers usually rely on image manipulation libraries, such as ImageMagick, for conversion. Offloading the task in this way would allow me to concentrate on the scope of the app I am writing. It also saves me significant time and labor in the short term. Yet shortcuts like ImageMagick depend on external code not written or hosted by the Libraries. The use of such dependencies as part of Vault may therefore be vulnerable to obsolescence or deprecation, thus yet another tension at play in project maintenance. A desire to reduce the complexity of code conflicts with another desire to reduce dependencies and maximize a project’s persistence. Such tensions are, for good reason, more likely to be accepted than resolved in projects like Vault.</p>
<h2 id="defining-the-labor-perspective">Defining the Labor Perspective</h2>
<p>What does my work with Vault tell readers of this journal about minimal computing? This may at first sound like a rather odd or misguided question. After all, Vault is substantial in both its size and reach, and it draws upon a significant array of resources in the Libraries.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  Again, Vault is neither the product of a static site generator nor stored on a small, single-board computer.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  It is also not a project about the art of programming, elegant code, or teaching the fundamentals of computing.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  It is, however, an informative case study for minimal computing from what Sayers and I call the labor perspective, where — drawing from work across media and technology studies⁠, especially McKenzie Wark’s  <em>Molecular Red</em>  — labor is an activity operating both within and against computation,<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  where the combination of within and against is key to our approach <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Contra Marx, we need not find humans, and specifically the universal human subject, always at the center of labor.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  To quote Wark,  “Labor is the mingling of many things, most of them not human”   <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>, hence our attention to both activity and infrastructure throughout the following inquiry.</p>
<p>The logic of the labor perspective unfolds like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computation is historical, not abstract. Minimal computing starts in the middle of institutional work⁠ — in medias res.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  It engages computation as mediation, beyond the packaging of minimalism as a canned style, transhistorical feature, or list of fundamentals intended for download and exchange. From the labor perspective, a minimal computing project is its files and the relationships between them; it is also the ongoing activity of maintenance, customization, and care moving into the future with the past in mind.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></li>
<li>Computation subsumes labor. Or, labor is found within computation <sup id="fnref2:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  Minimal computing happens within infrastructures greater, or larger, than itself. From the labor perspective, a minimal computing project attends to the power and persistence of these infrastructures and determines which ones are worth maintaining.</li>
<li>Yet labor also experiments with computation <sup id="fnref3:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Or, it is an activity of resistance and friction, especially with respect to software’s default settings. Minimal computing projects find new uses for computing outside SAAS paradigms. From the labor perspective, a minimal computing project positions technical work as creative and critical work beyond familiarity with management systems.</li>
<li>Minimal computing from the labor perspective may thus be defined as  <em>the reduction of computation’s alienating effects</em> : the alienation of projects but also of practitioners from social organization and collective expertise. From the labor perspective, a minimal computing project degrows computation’s tendency to reinvest in productivity by investing instead in shared structures and common activities, also called convivial computing  <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these aspects are more than metaphors, and they can be unpacked with attention to the particulars of Vault as a computing project and labor issue.</p>
<p>We would be remiss, however, if we did not first recognize how minimalism is often an expression of power, if not an exaltation of it. Google’s reduction of search to a single input field on a mostly blank page is a canonical example of such power.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  The cost of Apple products, known for their minimalist design, is yet another. Beyond computing, we may⁠ — at the risk of digressing for a moment — look to minimalist sculpture in the U.S. starting in the 1960s. Donald Judd once described such sculpture as plain power  <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>, and Frank Stella said,  “What you see is what you see”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Here, the exposure of means is the medium, what Anna Chave deems not only a will to power but also the face of patriarchy and capital <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  In the New York&rsquo;s minimalist sculpture scene during the 1960s, that will to power was also predominantly white and male, and a lot of the work was factory-made, or it evinced the factory-made.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  Chave notes that Tony Smith once boasted,  “I didn’t make a drawing; I just picked up the phone and ordered it”   <sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Minimalist sculpture of that scene rarely left a trace or signature of its production, and it did not appear to address a particular subject or community of subjects <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  It functioned more like an impersonal, austere, monolithic object⁠: as anti-artifice rather than art in the making <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. It did not readily disclose its process of composition, either, reminding audiences that laying bare the means does not necessitate attribution, let alone transparency, of labor.</p>
<p>This labor issue persists in the exhibition and care of minimalist sculpture found in public parks and plazas. Consider, for instance, Chave’s analysis of Richard Serra’s  <em>Tilted Arc</em> , constructed in 1981 and commissioned by the U.S. General Services Administration’s Art in Architecture Program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its site on Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan, Serra’s mammoth, perilously titled steel arc formed a divisive barrier too tall (12 feet) to see over, and a protracted trip (120 feet) to walk around. In the severity of its material, the austerity of its form, and in its gargantuan size, it served almost as a grotesque amplification of Minimalism’s power rhetoric. Something about the public reaction to that rhetoric can be deduced from the graffiti and the urine that liberally covered the work almost from the first, as well as from the petitions demanding its removal (a demand met last year). <sup id="fnref2:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, minimalism was so assertive, so aggressive in its will to power, that people responded by tagging it and relieving themselves on it.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  Employees of the Department of Health and Human Services then had to attend to it⁠ — all to help maintain Serra’s public work. After almost a decade of this back-and-forth,  _Tilted Arc _ was dissected into three pieces, removed, and delivered to a nearby scrap-metal yard <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While minimalist sculpture in New York may not appear immediately relevant to Vault, it does provide an example of how minimalism is value-laden, and it may serve as a model for how  <em>not</em>  to approach minimal computing from the labor perspective. Rather than assuming that a minimalist project is the impersonal expression of means or the exaltation of a lone artist’s patriarchal power and capital, the labor perspective attends to the social and material mingling of activities with infrastructure over time. We approach this mingling through technical, organizational, and affective labor in particular.</p>
<h2 id="technical-labor-on-the-recalcitrance-of-computing">Technical Labor: On the Recalcitrance of Computing</h2>
<p>The technical labor of Vault engages the recalcitrance of computing <sup id="fnref4:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>, and it starts in the middle. In the narrowest senses of mediation and history, it migrates and localizes materials from the there of CONTENTdm to the here of Vault in the Libraries. This by no means makes Vault unique. Thousands of these stories exist across the world, and — as noted previously in this article — more and more institutions are moving from SAAS to FOSS for the purposes of management. But in medias res persists as a theme even when we speak more generally about Vault; web and software projects rarely start from scratch and, of course, memory institutions by necessity engage with historical materials in their collections. In the case of UVic, these include collections such as Victorian Serial Novels; Herbert Geddes; Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts; Food Not Bombs; and the Rikki Swin Institute: Gender Education, Research, Library, and Archives.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  Digitizing, stewarding, and caring for these materials is labor-intensive, and localizing them with customizations of Hyku written in Ruby underscores how migration is not a mere copy-and-paste job from CONTENTdm.</p>
<p>When viewed in the aggregate, these issues of mediation demonstrate why maintenance, rather than innovation or disruption, is a fundamental term for Vault and the labor around it. The lived reality of Vault and other FOSS projects is one of constant negotiation with software, of moving from one moment of stabilization to the next, between past and future. As Vault reduces UVic’s alienation from its own collections, and the Libraries from their own labor and computing, all as an alternative to proprietary software in the academy, it also makes everyone involved more aware of the means available for asset management. This awareness of means underscores the fact that technical labor — like all creative and critical work — carries both negative and affirmative connotations, from managing endless bugs and implementing updates to experimenting with code, building knowledge around historical materials, and imagining new uses for computing.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>
<p>An awareness of means has been an appeal of minimalism for some time now. In his examination of minimalist tendencies in music and plastic arts, Edward Strickland asserts:  “In much Minimal music . . . overt and immediately audible repetition of simple, even simplistic material, is the predominant structural principle. In dance, film, sculpture, and literature, similarly, Minimalism exposes the components of its medium in skeletal form”   <sup id="fnref1:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. The same may be argued for the technical labor of minimal computing; for instance, the components, skeleton, and even the principles of infrastructure are foregrounded in the design of open-source microcontrollers and static site generators.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  People accessing or contributing to such projects are presumably not estranged from computation’s component parts and, in some cases, the connections between those parts and their dependencies. The materials are presented in plain sight, as if they  <em>are</em>  the interface. Vault does something similar through the simplicity of its online presentation. Descriptions, metadata, and items are all shared together on the same page, and a collection’s size (in bytes), number of items, provenance, and permalink are readily available. Additionally, since Vault is a custom instance of Hyku — and Hyku is FOSS designed for modification and reuse — the Libraries may create new features or adapt existing ones to suit workflows specific to UVic.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  In CONTENTdm, there is no easy way for people to download either specific image items or images of an item’s constituent parts, such as particular pages in a codex. The components and skeletal form of CONTENTdm are not readily apparent to local developers, and modifying its code is very difficult and likely illegal. CONTENTdm is thus an example of the proverbial black box.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  Developers and libraries must rely on the vendor (the Online Computer Library Center) to determine costs of features, which of those features to offer, and when.</p>
<p>With Vault, the Libraries see the component parts and their relations, and the UVic team may adjust the platform’s settings to allow or disallow file downloads and increase granularity in access protocols, making only a subset of collections downloadable or permitting downloads of specific works in a given collection. This sort of technical labor, including customization, applies to the general maintenance and care for Vault: the living activity of ensuring the social and technical reproduction of the Libraries’ holdings through code and software. It is also central to reproducing scholarship and, by extension, the academy <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. As we discuss later in this article, smaller projects, such as a journal built with Jekyll or an exhibit made with Wax gems, may integrate Vault, with items from UVic’s holdings becoming featured materials for curation and interpretation and the platform itself serving as infrastructure for the description and persistence of assets.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  This aspect of Vault and projects like it is critical to approaching minimal computing from the technical labor point of view, as it prompts practitioners to account for the entire stack of scholarly communication, and to render visible its structures and components, even if no one is an expert in all the areas and technologies involved.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  While some layers of this stack, such as storage, servers, digitized assets, and metadata, may be centralized according to standards at institutions like the Libraries, other layers, such as applications and even data, may be decentralized.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  But focusing solely on particular layers of a stack — on only a journal or exhibit application and not the storage and server, for instance — risks abstracting an otherwise social process and treating its features as immediate or ahistorical.</p>
<p>Low-tech practices such as pseudocode help to render an otherwise recalcitrant stack intelligible to a group — to keep code mingling, and to degrow its alienating effects. The labor question is not whether everyone in the Libraries knows how to code (where programming is a means to power) or whether code does what it says (where code as  <em>logos</em>  is the means becoming the medium).<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  It is, more generally, whether people follow how  <em>this</em>  becomes  <em>that</em> : how, for example, a TIFF becomes a PDF with a simple program that begins as a specifications list and is then translated into Ruby, which is then written into infrastructure. Such shared working knowledge brushes against  “what you see is what you see,”   plain power assumptions of common sense, also popular in minimalist design principles like Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS), where simplicity is presented overtly in ableist terms, as if it is obvious or readily apparent to whomever.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>  In reality, the unfolding of technical labor is not obvious, uniform, immediate, or even coherent. As pseudocode for Vault reveals, simplicity is value, and it must be iterated, learned, and communicated through composites of knowledge and experience that gradually decrease collective estrangement. Otherwise, the recalcitrance of computing and the layers of a stack are naturalized: assumed to be an abstract quality of a project or an inherent property of computers. “I’m not good with computers,” we might, for good reason, hear someone say, and minimalist expressions of plain power and assertions of technical labor’s simple sense may be reasons why.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-labor-on-bringing-people-together-around-tasks">Organizational Labor: On Bringing People Together around Tasks</h2>
<p>The organizational labor of Vault addresses people’s everyday negotiations with computing but also  “thread[s] people together around their tasks”   <sup id="fnref5:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Vault is a collaboration across digitization, metadata and cataloguing, software development, systems, and digital scholarship and strategy in the Libraries. Each of these groups has their own areas of concentration, across which they work and communicate. Organization is vital for these reasons. Vault is developed, maintained, and used by unionized employees at UVic; those unions agree upon and follow collective agreements, which are pivotal to stability, advocacy, and governance given the increasing number of precarious positions in and beyond the academy, the expanding breadth of job qualifications in the gig economy, the rise of for-profit colleges, and the maintenance, carework, and digital labor involved in FOSS <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  Such agreements also foster a collective awareness of a mediating apparatus, if you will, without assuming consensus among all involved.</p>
<p>Expounding Donna Haraway’s cyborg point of view, Wark says an  “apparatus renders  <em>to</em>  the human a world that isn’t for the human”   <sup id="fnref6:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>  Wark is not examining computing here, but it fits. While practices such as pseudocode matter for the comprehension of computation — for understanding in general terms how this becomes that⁠ — a mediating apparatus affects apprehension, or the aspects of a computing stack that are not intended for us. Components of code may speak more often to each other, or to machines, than to (most) people. Recall, for instance, this line of Ruby:  <code>qpdf #{input_pdf_name} — linearize #{output_pdf_name}</code> . It is not exactly human-readable, even if aspects of it are intelligible. Or, approaching the business of mediation more broadly, people are unable to witness what a project like Vault is doing behind the scenes or on the back end. So much process is indecipherable or invisible, and this can all be quite alienating in the absence of organizational labor. After all, people rely upon software and instill their trust in it, usually without being proximate to those who keep it running.<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>  Ensuring that an apparatus is understood as social and technical labor supported by collective agreements decreases the potential for estrangement without aspiring for immediacy. It also increases the visibility of technical labor, affirms it, and underscores why it is essential, in part by framing maintenance as research publishable in a journal such as this one. Furthermore, collective awareness of an apparatus⁠ — a shared apprehension of how it renders to us what is not for us — can shape the language and practice of organizing around Vault — project rather than product, for example, or minimal computing as labor first, then style, specification, file, or theme, if need be. With such changes, a project’s design process may begin with maintenance considerations rather than ignoring them (acting as if they do not exist), deferring them (acting as if they matter less than other considerations), or attending to them as they emerge (acting as if they are isolated incidents rather than patterns or cascades).</p>
<h2 id="affective-labor-on-being-directed-by-computing-and-computing-projects">Affective Labor: On Being Directed by Computing and Computing Projects</h2>
<p>The affective labor of Vault engages the feeling of being directed by computing and computing projects <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. As we mentioned earlier, the challenges of technical labor are compounded when people are not compensated or supported for developing their expertise, or where a lack of resources or staff means one person must wear many hats and fix bugs in code as they arise. While the organizational labor of a collective agreement may help to alleviate issues related to compensation and professional development, the occupational aspect of many hats involves various cultural factors that are entwined with the everyday experiences of programming and carework. A labor approach to Vault underscores the need for structures and guidelines that protect employees from outside demands for increased efficiency or motivate institutions to reinvest a project’s surplus in productivity. UVic’s  <em>Library Services for Grant-Funded Research Projects</em>  unfolds along these lines, communicating to researchers what the Libraries do and do not provide, when, and the monetary value of in-kind contributions.<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>  Where affect matters here is in the articulation of maintenance with service and happiness: fixing bugs that impede people’s access to historical materials, for instance, or designing simple interfaces to decrease friction during research, not to mention enduring recurring acts of mansplaining and routinely being asked to communicate one’s position in a feminized library workforce.<sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  These are topics, no doubt associated with expectations, that likely go unmentioned in a collective agreement. But, as Sara Ahmed makes clear in her work on building feminist worlds <sup id="fnref1:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>, such expectations are norms, and in computing they are norms entangled with how software and its values govern people, especially white women, nonbinary folks, and people of color, in how to act and feel. Ahmed calls this  “power as directionality”   <sup id="fnref2:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>, and included within it is the heteropatriarchal command (if tacit) to appear happy and busy during maintenance and care, despite the fact that frustration, delays, negotiation, bugs, skepticism, confusion, and complaints are not just inevitable but necessary aspects of any inventive computing project, especially if and when people are wearing many hats.<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup></p>
<p>Minimal computing from the labor perspective is thus premised on supporting (and not just accommodating) people who are marginalized or silenced by systemic directionality. It aims to name problems, call attention to norms, slow down investments in productivity, discuss difficult topics, experiment, and refuse to feign happiness when maintenance and carework are devalued. This means the degrowth of computing’s alienating effects must at the same time recognize alienation as a critical position, even if the result is a contradiction.<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>  Ahmed states:  “If alienation is sensation, it is not . . . just or only the sensation of negation”   <sup id="fnref3:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. It is studious; it is wonder  <sup id="fnref4:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. Ahmed offers a guide to such alienation in her  “killjoy survival kit”   <sup id="fnref5:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>, and other cultural precedents for engaging affect in computing include  <em>Bodies of Information</em> , edited by Jacqueline Wernimont and Elizabeth Losh; zines by Julia Evans, Mimi Onuoha, and Mother Cyborg (Diana Nucera); and recommendations made by Katrina Anderson et al. <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>  Each of these publications succeeds at moving beyond heroification (Hail the maintainers!) and romantic celebrations of maintenance without devaluing or abstracting it from social and material relations.<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>  Parallel steps may include recognizing how minimal computing manifests from both a necessity and desire to degrow. This is the path to which we now turn.</p>
<h2 id="degrowing-digital-projects-necessity-and-desire">Degrowing Digital Projects: Necessity and Desire</h2>
<p>Degrowth in minimal computing instigates a shift from using technologies to reinvest in productivity (“crunch,” increased output, longer hours, more data, jobs rather than careers, and technology as a service, for instance) to designing shared structures that support technical, organizational, and affective labor as critical and creative activities. This is frequently achieved by reducing scope creep, and thus we might echo Alex Gil’s question,  “What do we need?”   <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>. We might also look to  <em>archipelagos — a journal of Caribbean digital praxis</em>  for examples. With co-editor, Kaiama L. Glover, Gil describes that journal in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e have thought through our platform with the same critical eye we cast on the archive, and our resulting infrastructure embodies our principles. We are fully open access and charge no author fees. Our authors retain their copyright. We pursue best indexing, accessibility, and archival practices. We emphasize the primacy of sustainable authorship in plain text.<sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>  Our website and PDFs are generated from the same markdown files using Jekyll and ConTeXt, respectively. The resulting website is light-weight and mobile-friendly, acknowledging the importance of mobile phones, bandwidth differentials, and data costs in the Caribbean.<br>
<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup><br>
The skeleton of the project, not to mention its editorial and commit history, are accessible to readers along with the journal’s technological stack. Readers are also  “allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles in [the] journal without asking prior permission from the publishers”   <sup id="fnref1:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>. The publication process relies on Markdown and format redundancy (PDF and HTML) rather than extensive markup or word processing, and it is enhanced by Dublin Core for general metadata needs.<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>  The interface, like the project itself⁠, privileges content and responsive design. There are no ads or contrast errors, there is only one menu, the HTML is mostly valid, and articles are available in a single column (without distracting sidebars). The journal also bypasses a content management system and database and, in doing so, reduces the frequency of potential errors and hacks. All of this work is done by necessity to facilitate access in the Caribbean and reduce the likelihood of alienating readers and researchers there. At one point, Glover and Gil ask,  “How might we encourage collaboration with, increase accessibility for, and otherwise work to narrow the gap between Caribbeanist researchers, especially those in the North Atlantic academy, and the communities we are committed to serving?”   <sup id="fnref2:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the labor perspective, Glover and Gil also articulate minimalism with sustainability. They publish the journal’s workflow, render clear its standards and structure, bypass subscription fees (including SAAS fees), credit all team members (including the designer, architect, and editorial board), and ensure the journal is available in English, French, and Spanish. Even though  <em>archipelagos</em>  relies on GitHub for storage and distribution, the entire journal (213.3 MB as of this writing) could easily be downloaded to a USB stick and deposited with a library, press, or nonprofit organization, without any need for a running version of Ruby or Jekyll.<sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>  What’s more, Glover, Gil, and the  <em>archipelagos</em>  team provide a low-maintenance, light-footprint model for other projects that could integrate and interpret collections housed by open-source platforms such as Vault, thereby bridging small, nimble, and focused projects with large, persistent, and extensive ones often found in libraries. Their model may especially appeal to groups and institutions that are underfunded, under-resourced, and/or understaffed. Certainly, the project’s files and open-source repository and the files contained within it are crucial here; however, the technical, organizational, and affective labor involved in  <em>archipelagos</em> ’ production is equally important, framed around a dedicated team with a clear sense of the sort of scholarship and knowledge work they want to see in the world. The project may be what Jonathan Sterne had in mind when, in 2007, he called for  “a whole convivial system of digital components, a convivial digital infrastructure”   <sup id="fnref1:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The labor of minimal computing may also emerge from a desire to degrow “forever” projects. Here, we might ask what relationships we want with technologies and each other as we are propelled into the future.<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>  Keeping in mind that academic FOSS initiatives are largely dominated by wealthy, historically white universities, what kind of work can other institutions maintain? Or do they wish to maintain? Which infrastructures are worth keeping? Which projects are, or should be, prioritized, updated, and routinely debugged?<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>  For how long, and by whom? Which tasks do we want to automate or offload to scripts, and which do we want to conduct manually?<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup>  If, as Susan Brown et al. indicate,  “Users now firmly expect that scholarly digital publications will be kept up-to-the-minute and respond to user suggestions”   <sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>, then minimal computing from the labor perspective addresses user (or consumer) expectations directly by accepting and encouraging others to accept the fact that the internet and digital materials, like all other materials, age, rot, and degrade <sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>; that code does not always do what it says <sup id="fnref4:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>; that capturing content and archiving the web is a  “messy affair”   <sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup>; and that even public projects must stop growing at some point. Initiatives such as Vault are in positions to organize around this issue and educate people on the lived realities of preservation, planned obsolescence, and digital labor, where projects are published yet presumably never done <sup id="fnref1:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup></p>
<p>Part of this degrowth may imply attention to, if not an embrace of, ephemerality in scholarly communication <sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup>. Or, in some cases, the labor response may very well be done or enough, a refutation of the assumption that practitioners are service-providers who accumulate piles of technical debt that must be paid indefinitely back to users expecting fresh content on demand.<sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup>  And yet others may focus on computing and labor’s potential role in environmental justice. As Stefania Barca argues,  “Alienation of the producers from the products of their work is what leads to the reinvestment of surplus into increased production,”  and  “weak unions and virtually non-existent enforcement of labor regulations play a major role in determining the environmental impact of production”   <sup id="fnref3:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Each of these possibilities demonstrates why, in the last instance, necessity may be inextricable from desire.</p>
<p>At UVic, the Endings Project (2020) at the Humanities Computing and Media Centre (HCMC) has begun addressing degrowth via technical labor practices.<sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup>  Although they do not use the term degrow, they argue that  “projects⁠ — even digital ones⁠ — need to end”   <sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup>. We agree from the vantage of both desire and necessity. The HCMC outlines “endings principles for digital longevity,” consisting of five primary components: data, products, processing, documentation, and release management. Various aspects of these principles correspond with dimensions of minimal computing, such as  “build a static website with no databases,”    “[d]ata is stored only in formats which conform to open standards and which are amenable to processing,”  and  “every entity in the site has a unique page with a simple URL”   <sup id="fnref1:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup>  One potential benefit of the Endings Project is it could nudge researchers, especially faculty members, to start their projects with an ending in mind and⁠ — recalling Tony Smith’s boast in 1966 — curb the likelihood of people phoning in projects for others to build and maintain.<sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup>  Starting a project with an ending, and a roadmap for how to get there, should increase researcher awareness of projects like Vault as well as the labor required to publish content and keep the machine running. It could also encourage more researcher involvement in maintenance and carework and, by extension, degrow researcher alienation from their own projects. Importantly, all of these possibilities extend beyond the habituated use of management systems — a tendency encouraged by many SAAS paradigms.</p>
<p>And ultimately, that is what we hope minimal computing from the labor perspective may achieve through degrowth: a change in habits, culture, and values, not just technologies. We admit it is no small task.</p>

</code></pre><p>In the example above, someone might reasonably guess that tst is a misspelling of test and therefore that  <code>tst + 6</code>  should equal 10. But the computer in this scenario has labelled this a reference error because the computer assumes there is an entity tst to which the programmer has forgotten to assign a value. By the computer’s understanding, the programmer is referring to something that does not exist. This is a very simplified version of a miscommunication, but it demonstrates how the assumptions people and machines make are not necessarily identical. Is tst a misspelling of a variable test, or is it a variable on its own? In this scenario, if not generally speaking, computers do not tolerate ambiguity well; they rely on and require both assistance and interpretation.</p>

<p>As you become aware of how the social world is organized, norms appear as palpable things. I think of those times, say, when you walk into a toy shop and it is striking. You might pick up the vacuum cleaner, a toy vacuum cleaner, and feel like you are holding the future for girls in a tangible thing. You can pick up a toy gun, and also feel this: the future for boys held as a tangible thing. Norms become striking: holdable as palpable things. Once we are stricken, there is still much work left to do. The hardest work can be recognizing how one’s own life is shaped by norms in ways that we did not realize, in ways that cannot simply be transcended. A norm is also a way of living, a way of connecting with others over or around something. We cannot ‘not’ live in relation to norms <sup id="fnref8:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>.</p>

Drawing from <sup id="fnref:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">108</a></sup>, Nicolas Gold writes about costs:  “Although much emphasis is placed on the delivery of new systems, the maintenance of existing software consumes at least 50% of the lifetime cost of a software system”   <sup id="fnref1:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup>. William Kretzschmar underscores the relationship between maintenance and funding:  “The largest humanities computing projects are likely to require continuing care and maintenance, if not more radical representation and reinterpretation in light of the advance of scholarship, and yet they seem unlikely ever to be funded comprehensively for these tasks. The best way forward is to create some sort of stable institutional setting for large projects that will provide continuity and baseline resources for the work”   <sup id="fnref1:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup>. Meanwhile, James Smithies writes about methodologies:  “We are only just beginning to find processes that will genuinely assist our software engineering tasks. There are now a handful of broadly accepted methodologies that claim [to]⁠ — and generally do⁠ — make the task of software engineering and maintenance easier (RUP, AGILE, PRINCE 2, ITIL), but few organisations have either the will or the means to deploy these approaches in a ‘purist’ sense”   <sup id="fnref1:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup>.

As postcolonial scholars have argued, the Enlightenment gave rise to the idea of a homogeneous definition of ‘human,’ which centers the European subject and, in turn, marginalizes all whose cultures, lifestyles, and values deviate from the universal.

<p>On carework in particular, see Bengi Akbulut, who defines it both narrowly and generally:  “The most straightforward (yet admittedly narrow) definition of carework is labor performed to fulfill the needs of those who cannot do so themselves, such as food provision, cleaning, health, etc. Broader understandings of carework stress that such work is often performed in tandem with and complementary to other types of (unpaid) reproductive labor and cannot be considered separate from the broader sphere of social reproduction.

<p>Perhaps the most common way people talk about minimalism, especially in Europe and North America, is through the language of reduction. Encyclopedia definitions of minimalism are rife with reduction <sup id="fnref:121"><a href="#fn:121" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">121</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:122"><a href="#fn:122" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">122</a></sup>, which⁠ Jon Barth finds in writing by everyone from Robert Browning (less is more), Emily Dickinson, Edgar Allan Poe, Henry James, Ernest Hemingway, and Samuel Beckett to Frederick Barthelme, Ann Beattie, Bobbie Ann Mason, and Raymond Carver⁠, not to mention the rationalism of a certain mathematician and philosopher:  “[A]fter the excesses of scholasticism comes Descartes’s radical reductionism⁠ — let us doubt and discard everything not self-evident and see whether anything indubitable remains upon which to rebuild”   <sup id="fnref:123"><a href="#fn:123" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">123</a></sup>. Modernist painter, John D. Graham uses reduction to define minimalism in the visual arts:  “Minimalism is the reducing of painting to the minimum ingredients for the sake of discovering the ultimate, logical destination of painting in the process of abstracting”   <sup id="fnref:124"><a href="#fn:124" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">124</a></sup>. Marc Botha acknowledges Graham as well as critics Frances Colpitt and Cynthia W. Hallett, in his transhistorical and transdisciplinary theory of minimalism, where he frames reduction as a minimalist practice and concept:  “The minimalist story . . . speaks of a simplicity arrived at through the disciplined process of reduction”   <sup id="fnref:125"><a href="#fn:125" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">125</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:124"><a href="#fn:124" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">124</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:126"><a href="#fn:126" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">126</a></sup>. From a more situated perspective, James Meyer contextualizes reduction, linking it to the new austerity movement of the mid-1960s:  “The popular concept of the minimal as an aesthetic of refusal, of reduction, became so omnivorous that it quickly overtook the practices it was first applied to”   <sup id="fnref:127"><a href="#fn:127" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">127</a></sup>. Hal Foster acknowledges this historical prominence of reduction in definitions of minimalist art, only to the object, calling reduction a  “great misreading”   <sup id="fnref1:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Meanwhile, Hartmut Obendorf anchors his human-computer interaction (HCI) methodology for designing simplicity and designing the minimal in a pragmatist reduction resonating with the economy of Occam’s razor:  “The practitioner should be able to consciously choose his/her tools and make informed design decisions . . . To this end, this book defines an ideal for design, focuses on reduction as a technique, and draws on the notion of minimalism to differentiate understanding of simplicity”   <sup id="fnref:128"><a href="#fn:128" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">128</a></sup>. Invested more in ideas and lifestyle minimalism than computing or interaction design, the first chapter of Kyle Chayka’s  <em>The Longing for Less: Living with Minimalism</em>  is titled, Reduction, where the term serves as a starting point for understanding minimalism and what else it may mean or do <sup id="fnref:129"><a href="#fn:129" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">129</a></sup>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:37" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Influencers that frequently appear on lists of influential minimalist Instagram accounts are predominantly white and East Asian (today’s Japanese minimalism arises from Zen and Buddhist traditions).

<p>This logic was central to early work on the Scalar platform for multimodal scholarly communication (see <a href="https://scalar.me/anvc/">https://scalar.me/anvc/</a>). Sayers published an article on Scalar with Craig Dietrich, noting that Scalar’s  “authors are not creating small, isolated archives on the Scalar server. Although they can upload their own videos, audio, and images to that space, they are instead encouraged to house them with a partner archive. Or, in the case where assets are already online, they are encouraged to embed those assets in their Scalar projects. That way, systems point to existing URIs rather than duplicating resources and producing redundancies. Here, the advantage is that media playback is overseen by groups that not only have institutional support but also specialise in metadata, asset categorisation, provenance, and interoperability”   <sup id="fnref:141"><a href="#fn:141" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">141</a></sup>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:56" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>For more on common sense, Stuart Hall and Alan O’Shea describe common sense as  “a form of ‘everyday thinking’ which offers us frameworks of meaning with which to make sense of the world. It is a form of popular, easily-available knowledge which contains no complicated ideas, requires no sophisticated argument and does not depend on deep thought or wide reading. It works intuitively, without forethought or reflection. It is pragmatic and empirical, giving the illusion of arising directly from experience, reflecting only the realities of daily life and answering the needs of ‘the common people’ for practical guidance and advice”   <sup id="fnref:143"><a href="#fn:143" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">143</a></sup>. They add that  “Common sense, tends to be socially conservative, leaning toward tradition”   <sup id="fnref1:143"><a href="#fn:143" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">143</a></sup>. Consider, for instance, the treatment of computing practices as something you simply do or keep doing. Without attention to the labor perspective (among other social and cultural approaches), the minimalist dimensions of minimal computing lend themselves to demands for the easily-available, intuitive, pragmatic, empirical, and socially conservative.

<p>The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) wrote in 2018:  “More Canadians are working in precarious conditions, employed in contract, temporary, and/or part-time jobs with low wages. The increase has been concentrated in accommodation and food services, education, information, culture and recreation services — and particularly among young workers aged 15 to 24 and older workers aged 65+. The [Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives] recently reported that among the university and college workforce, as many as half are employed in precarious conditions. A disproportionate share of those are the 68,000 CUPE workers employed in this sector. Permanent jobs make up a declining share of the overall jobs in the post-secondary workforce.

<p>Another description of the apparatus may be useful here. In  _Meeting the Universe Halfway, _ Karen Barad writes:  “(1) apparatuses are specific material-discursive practices (they are not merely laboratory setups that embody human concepts and take measurements); (2) apparatuses produce differences that matter — they are boundary-making practices that are formative of matter and meaning, productive of, and part of, the phenomena produced; (3) apparatuses are material configurations/dynamic reconfigurings of the world; (4) apparatuses are themselves phenomena (constituted and dynamically reconstituted as part of the ongoing intra-activity of the world); (5) apparatuses have no intrinsic boundaries but are open-ended practices; and (6) apparatuses are not located in the world but are material configurations or reconfigurings of the world that re(con)figure spatiality and temporality as well as (the traditional notion of) dynamics (i.e., they do not exist as static structures, nor do they merely unfold or evolve in space and time)”   <sup id="fnref:147"><a href="#fn:147" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">147</a></sup>.

Of these, only one woman was singled out for individual treatment: the ‘Ida M. Tarbell Papers Digitization Project,’ awarded $30,000. Similarly, only one African-American was at the center of a project: ‘Digitizing W.E.B. Du Bois,’ awarded $314,787. This means that projects on individual women and black Americans were awarded only 8% of the total $4,225,061 awarded to projects on individuals.

<p>As part of the  _Lift Every Voice and Sing _ project, Donaldson links ephemerality, memory, and minimal computing with Black lives and Black digital humanities:  “In this moment, one in which we are forced to confront our own fragility, our own ephemerality as (potentially) disappearing bodies amid a global pandemic, minimal computing impels us toward a reassessment of our individual and communal practices and makes apparent the ways we might reject circulating notions of a  new normal  as we think about the potential to reclaim and reshape community. What might that look like? What is sustainable? What is not? What do we need?”   <sup id="fnref1:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>. Elsewhere, Sample asks:  “[M]ust everything be permanent? Must we insist that every cultural object be subjected to the archive?”   <sup id="fnref1:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup>. Sayers also speaks to ephemerality in the context of minimal computing, which may be understood as  “maximum ephemerality” :  “Reduce an impulse to inscribe, measure, or visualize with technologies in order to increase the likelihood of experimentation and collective participation”   <sup id="fnref2:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">100</a></sup>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:91" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>In 2019, the Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University presented  <em>Caravans of Gold, Fragments in Time: Art, Culture, and Exchange across Medieval Saharan Africa</em> , an exhibition of collection items representing trade and cultural exchange across the Saharan desert from the 8th to 16th centuries <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. That spring, the lead curator of  <em>Caravans of Gold</em>  led a seminar in which the students were tasked with developing content for a digital version of the multilingual exhibit as a class project. The goals of the digital exhibit were twofold: (1) provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to make curatorial decisions in a real-world context and (2) develop a digital museum experience for people in Mali, Morocco, and Nigeria. Northwestern University Libraries partnered with the Block Museum to develop and maintain the exhibit website.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="project-planning">PROJECT PLANNING</h2>
<p>More than half of all global internet traffic is generated from a mobile device. In African countries, mobile internet traffic accounts for two-thirds of all web page visits <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. In terms of network speeds, Morocco is about even with the global average; however, mobile data in Nigeria and Mali is downloaded at half the speed of the global average <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. This was echoed anecdotally from our museum partners,<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  who requested a mobile app, rather than a traditional website, for the digital exhibit.</p>
<p>Traditional mobile apps are developed for the operating system on which they are intended to be installed. Android is the most popular operating system in Mali, Morocco, and Nigeria; however, iOS is also used in Nigeria and Morocco, with between 7% and 19% of mobile market share respectively <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Unfortunately, the same native mobile app cannot run on both Android and iOS devices; thus, we would need to develop two mobile apps with identical features.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-really-need">WHAT DO WE REALLY NEED?</h2>
<p>Given this scope, it was useful to unpack the initial request to develop a mobile app for  <em>Caravans of Gold</em> . Northwestern University Libraries does not develop mobile apps. We develop static websites for various forms of scholarly and educational materials and deposit archival copies in an institutional repository. Static websites help keep our costs down while giving us the flexibility to produce customizable, modern, secure, and content-rich websites for students and scholars.</p>
<p>It is here that the central question of minimal computing —  “What do we need?”  — saved this project idea from being rejected outright <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. These were the core requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for mobile devices;</li>
<li>Performant on low-bandwidth networks;</li>
<li>Installable on mobile phones, leaving an app icon on the device;</li>
<li>Usable while not connected to the internet; and</li>
<li>Maintainable for at least 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out that we did not need the complex capabilities of traditional mobile apps, such as user accounts, access to the device’s file system, control of the camera or microphone, or push notifications. What we needed was a static website with Progressive Web App (PWA) features.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the planning phase for  <em>Caravans of Gold</em>  happened to coincide with early news of Wax,  “a minimal computing project for producing digital exhibitions focused on longevity, low costs, and flexibility”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Wax is an open source framework for the Jekyll static-site generator that contains a website theme and a set of automations that can be used to make a static website from a folder of images and a spreadsheet of item metadata. Wax made it easy for us to get started, and its connection to minimal computing generated learning opportunities for the libraries, the museum, and the students.</p>
<p>As a class project, the students assumed the role of museum curators by selecting images, writing texts, and working with a librarian to make a digital exhibit app. During the quarter, we spent a class period discussing the basics of minimal computing and the process for using Wax to build the exhibit. At the end of the term, the students assembled a folder containing photographic images of museum exhibit items, a spreadsheet of metadata about the items, a text document with some background, and contextual information for the website pages.</p>
<h2 id="progressive-web-apps-pwas">PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS (PWAs)</h2>
<p>PWAs provide the option for an app to be installed on a device for quick access and offline use. Unlike traditional mobile apps, PWAs can be written in standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no formal specification, nor is there a canonical package, library, or framework. PWAs simply denote websites that meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The website uses responsive design to fit any screen size;</li>
<li>The website is served over an HTTPS network;</li>
<li>The website includes a service worker to intercept and respond to network requests; and</li>
<li>The website includes a web app manifest file to allow devices to install it (MDN Contributors).</li>
</ul>
<p>Wax produces a responsive website that fits any screen. The HTTPS requirement is a feature provided by the web hosting service (in our case, Amazon Web Services). The web app manifest and service worker files needed to be added to the website we built with Wax and the Jekyll Multiple Languages plugin.</p>
<p>A web app manifest is a JSON file that includes information related to how an application can be installed to a device <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. A typical web app manifest includes the full name of the application; a short name of the application; a list of app icon paths in various sizes for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens; a background color; a display setting; and a URL for the app landing page. We provide three web app manifests, one for each language in the exhibit.</p>
<p>A service worker is a JavaScript file that acts as a network proxy to respond to HTTP requests, such as navigating from one web page to another <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. These files eliminate unnecessary network calls and enable the digital exhibit to be usable while the device is offline.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  We used a service worker to precache all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the English, French, and Arabic versions of the website and cache only the images that are loaded to the screen.</p>
<p>PWAs are an example of minimal computing concepts put into practice. Alex Russell distinguishes between PWAs and other web applications by their adherence to a set of foundational principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>URLs and links as the core organizing system: if you can&rsquo;t link to it, it isn&rsquo;t part of the web;</li>
<li>Markup and styling for accessibility, both to humans and search engines;</li>
<li>UI richness and system capabilities provided as additions to a functional core; and</li>
<li>Free to implement without permission or payment, which in practice means standards-based. <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Put into practice, these principles resemble Jentery Sayers’s definitions of minimal and maximal forms of computing: maximum access, maximum accessibility, minimal connectivity, and minimal vulnerabilities <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Native desktop and mobile apps, by contrast, betray these principles with proprietary packaging, installation requirements, and permissions-based distribution through app stores.</p>
<p>By side-stepping the app-store infrastructure, PWA evangelists seem to espouse similar values that we hear from the open access movement <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. In both cases, there is a desire to emphasize the basic technologies of the web in order to facilitate the free distribution of information. While the popularity of PWAs is indeed driven by commercial interests, the use of services workers and web asset bundling tools for academic web publications can make the renewal, dissemination, and preservation of the scholarly record easier.</p>
<h2 id="speed-and-performance">SPEED AND PERFORMANCE</h2>
<p>Websites that are slow to render are more difficult and frustrating to use, so we made it a priority to ensure fast page load times for  <em>Caravans of Gold</em>  users in Mali, Morocco, and Nigeria. Performance testing measures the speed at which the content of the website is loaded and displayed on a variety of user devices and networks. This is a key requirement to the PWA development process. Our primary tool for measuring performance is Google’s Lighthouse performance audits. Lighthouse provides evaluations in several categories: performance, accessibility, best practices, search engine optimization, and PWA. Lighthouse will simulate a desktop or mobile device and load the web page you select, assessing any one of those areas on a scale of 0-100. We made the following improvements as a result of the performance testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy the website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with GZIP compression<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  and</li>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-images">THE PROBLEM WITH IMAGES</h2>
<p>Large images consume high amounts of network data and make websites slow to load.  <em>Caravans of Gold</em>  contains over two hundred images but we wanted to keep the exhibit as small as possible by using a minimal number of image files and smaller file sizes, to ensure quick load times on any device. Meeting this goal prevented us from using some of the image processing features of Wax ( <code>wax:derivatives</code> ).</p>
<p>The  <code>wax:derivatives</code>  automation script is intended to process images for use on the web. There are two options for running the script called simple and IIIF. The simple option uses an image to create two derivates: (1) a small, thumbnail version and (2) a full, resized version. The IIIF option, named after the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), processes the images according a technical specification for making high-resolution images reusable by scholars and institutions. IIIF is typically used with image repository systems. It works by serving an image as many small image tiles that, all together, comprise the full image, allowing users to zoom, annotate, and manipulate the images for a variety of scholarly purposes. Both of these options generate more image files of larger file sizes than we need. One of the primary goals of PWAs is to lessen the hardware and network requirements for users of websites, and large images would require  <em>Caravans of Gold</em>  users to have more device storage and network data access than is necessary.</p>
<p>Instead, we resorted to compressing and resizing each image individually.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  We would not recommend this approach if it can be avoided. The original  <em>Caravans of Gold</em>  images varied in size, quality, and format. We needed to work with each image individually in order to crop, resize and reformat it in preparation for use with the project. It is generally a best practice to serve images that are appropriately sized to fit the screens upon which they will display. For the majority of our images, we created one size for desktop screens (between 600px and 800px in width) and one size for mobile screens (300px in width). We used HTML markup to help browsers select the appropriate image based on the width of the screen.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="translations">TRANSLATIONS</h2>
<p>Because  <em>Caravans of Gold</em>  features items that are loaned by museums in Mali, Morocco, and Nigeria, the Block Museum commissioned the translation of the English-language content into French and Arabic, the official languages of Mali and Morocco respectively. The goal was to enable all of the international lending institutions to promote the exhibit to their patrons, rather than exclusively publishing the exhibit in English.</p>
<p>Wax does not support multi-language websites. Wax provides an automated workflow for generating website content from a spreadsheet, but this only works on monolingual websites. Working with translations required us to use external tools to help generate the website in multiple languages. To handle the Arabic and French translations, we needed the Jekyll Multiple Languages plugin <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, which creates standalone websites for each language.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  The plugin stores all of the translations in YAML files, which are plain text files containing key-value pairs (for example,  <code>title: Caravans of Gold</code> ).</p>
<p>You can think of the YAML file as a database of definitions, where each word or phrase (the key) has a definition in either English, French, or Arabic (the value). For example, the English definition of the title of the website is represented as  <code>title: Caravans of Gold</code>  in the YAML file. Every word and sentence in the English, French, and Arabic versions of the website needed to be represented as an entry in a YAML file. This meant that we had to copy and paste text from Microsoft Word documents (.docx files) that were provided by the translators.</p>
<p>While the plugin allows us to build a website in three languages from a single codebase, we learned that it did not support right-to-left languages, like Arabic, without customizing the layouts. We had to significantly alter the HTML layouts in order to render an adequate right-to-left reading experience for the Arabic version of the exhibit. We did this in two ways: adding a  <code>dir=&quot;rtl&quot;</code>  attribute to HTML elements and using CSS rules to right-justify the text <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="guided-tours">GUIDED TOURS</h2>
<p>We designed  <em>Caravans of Gold</em>  to provide three methods of navigation: browsing, searching, and touring. The Wax theme organizes the exhibit items for browsing and searching by providing a gallery view of the collection as well as a search interface, but we also wanted to simulate a guided tour experience for visitors interested in reading a narrative behind the works, history, and locations featured throughout.</p>
<p>The exhibit is essentially organized into thirteen tours representing locations along a major Saharan trade route and points in time during the medieval period. Each tour features several key works and important context about the work’s history, relevance, and excavation. When a user clicks into one of the tours, they are launched into a full-screen slide deck presentation.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  Each tour is a single HTML file controlled by JavaScript to manage advancing through the slides. This was the final content piece we added to the exhibit.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The average internet user in the Global North has a faster network connection and more powerful internet device than the average internet user in the Global South. Static websites and PWAs provide technical solutions for addressing these global inequities in user experience by minimizing load times, file sizes, and network requests. Static website frameworks, like Wax, can be extended to include PWA features in order to improve the access and usability of digital content to people in the Global South.  <em>Caravans of Gold</em>  combines minimal computing with PWA technologies to successfully produce a multilingual digital exhibit app optimized for people around the world.</p>

<p>The conversation within the broad international digital humanities community around minimal computing has raised important questions about resource creation and access in contexts where Internet connectivity cannot be taken for granted and about the sustainability of digital humanities projects that scholars create. Minimal computing has served as an umbrella for discussions about hardware (labor conditions and environmental impact of manufacturing modern devices), networking (use of local area networks), and offline availability of resources. Arguably its greatest practical impact on digital humanities as praxis has been through advocacy for static HTML as a medium for digital humanities projects and websites.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the practical realities of implementing the most common minimal computing methods for web development. It addresses the amount of technically-oriented detail-work required to configure the complex set of components that underpin widely-used platforms for static site generation. When going minimal requires a great deal of technical labor, what implications does that have for its adoption by scholars without ongoing technical support or the money or connections to delegate that work? What is the added emotional labor for technical collaborators who are only allowed to consult with scholars, when they attempt to coach scholars through implementing a minimal computing site on their own? What opportunities are lost when a web development methodology cannot reasonably be taught in a hands-on way in a short workshop? After describing these challenges, this paper proposes that an infrastructural intervention — encompassing everything from writing better documentation, tutorials, and templates, to developing interfaces that mediate between users and technical complexity — is necessary to realize the potential of minimal computing as a framework for sustainable websites.</p>
<h2 id="website-as-a-long-term-commitment">Website as a Long-term Commitment</h2>
<p>The most widely-used methods of developing web-based digital humanities projects have brought with them major drawbacks around upkeep and maintenance. The trend of visually elaborate, interactive, Flash-based websites was short-lived but resulted in a set of digital humanities projects rendered inaccessible and unusable as soon as Flash stopped being widely supported.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  While individual database-driven content management systems (CMS) have waxed and waned, CMS have been widely used for building web-based digital humanities projects for over 15 years. From a user perspective, they offer many advantages, typically including graphic user interface-based (GUI) website configuration and customization options, a content editing interface that resembles a web form or word processor authoring environment, and the ability to easily extend the website’s functionality through plug-ins, which similarly provide user interface-based (UI) configuration.</p>
<p>The ease with which a user can get a CMS installed and running, particularly with the help of one-click installers offered by most commercial web-hosting services, belies the long-term challenges the user will likely encounter around maintenance and upkeep. Any website that relies on executable code in order to display content is at risk of that code being subverted in favor of others’ agendas. While individual projects may be targeted specifically for their subject matter (e.g., projects relating to Tibetan language and culture have become targets for Chinese cyberwarfare activities), more commonly, digital humanities projects fall victim to hackers probing sites running a CMS with known security vulnerabilities <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. If those responsible for maintaining a site have not been prompt in applying software patches as soon as they are released, the consequences can be quite severe. Many days or weeks of technical work can be required to restore a site to a previous working state (assuming backups were made) and secure it against future incursions <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. The work of recovering a CMS-based site that has been hacked is not trivial: if the scholar<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  is not comfortable with restoring MySQL backups and looking for malicious code changes and files, the task will likely fall to someone in their professional network, such as IT, library support staff, or a more technically-proficient colleague. Having a project website temporarily taken offline is a source of some embarrassment, but less-technical PIs who delegate the recovery work are largely insulated from the labor and stress involved in the process. This is, fundamentally, the trade-off at the heart of a decision to build a digital humanities project using a CMS:  _someone _ will be made responsible for the ongoing burden of patching and updating (and, when necessary, recovering) the entirety of the technical stack underpinning the project, in exchange for less-technical members of the project team being able to work in a relatively familiar, comfortable environment.</p>
<p>It is not surprising then that enthusiasm for building websites using minimal computing is likely to come from more-technical members of the digital humanities community, who have personally paid the maintenance costs in exchange for their colleagues’ ease of use <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. A project put on the web as static HTML cannot be compromised or hijacked through the numerous, complex vectors of attack to which database-driven CMS sites are vulnerable. Even if the server credentials are compromised and the static HTML files are removed or defaced, restoring the site is a much simpler process. Static sites have other advantages that are likely to be visible to digital humanities practitioners in IT and library roles. For example, it is easy to make a static site available, with its full functionality, in an offline environment.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  Likewise, static sites are much easier to preserve in their entirety for long-term archiving.</p>
<p>The questionable longevity of web-based projects is a common concern, particularly for scholars who are accustomed to thinking of their scholarship through the lens of monographs and articles, given the centuries of library- and publisher-based infrastructure built to support long-term access to scholarship published in those genres <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Established scholars who begin engaging with digital humanities later in their career frequently model a digital humanities project after a book: a sizable undertaking that one can cleanly  <em>finish</em> , with the result available for others to reference in perpetuity. A turn towards minimal computing as the default platform for developing web-based projects would seem to serve the interests of both less-technical scholars who want to ensure ongoing access to their digital work and technical partners or support staff, whose capacity for new undertakings diminishes with each project that requires ongoing maintenance. In practice, however, minimal computing web development poses a technical barrier high enough to necessitate both technical support and affective labor, even for scholars with enough baseline technical proficiency to be comfortable working independently in a CMS environment <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="the-making-of-static">The Making of Static</h2>
<p>For a certain generation of scholar-technologists, static HTML evokes memories of writing HTML by hand or with the assistance of GUI-based software such as Dreamweaver. Dreamweaver and similar software provided a framework for template files that generated repeated page elements (header, footer, sidebar), along with options for using a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) interface with buttons for styling and formatting text to construct the site and author content. The workflows that underpin recent efforts under the umbrella of minimal computing typically involve static site generator software configured using plain-text files, content authoring using Markdown, layout using template files with a combination of HTML and Liquid, design typically with SASS, with generation of the final HTML done via the command line, then transferred to a hosting environment using Git. This is a vastly different workflow than using the Dreamweaver WYSIWYG interface (which broadly resembled the modern WYSIWYG UI) for formatting text, hand-coding some HTML in the associated Dreamweaver integrated developer environment, and adding inline styles or referencing one or two CSS files for styling.</p>
<p>To use the most common minimal computing workflow, based on the Jekyll static site generation software, the scholar would need to install the Ruby programming language, along with a number of Ruby gems using the command line, then install Jekyll.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  Next, they would need to figure out what changes need to be made to the _config.yml file (without breaking it altogether with a stray space character), and start authoring content in Markdown — potentially while modifying the front matter variables and writing additional Liquid and HTML to use those variables in the templates. Making any layout or design changes involves figuring out where these changes have to go within numerous possible SASS files. Finally, the scholar would need to generate the output HTML using the command line, and determine which errors and warnings need to be addressed in order for the site to function and which can be safely ignored. This workflow is daunting even for the type of digital humanities practitioner who is not in a developer role as such but frequently handles other kinds of web development tasks and basic coding, along with project and program management (e.g., roles commonly found in library digital scholarship centers). Basic command-line usage, Markdown, CSS (if not SASS), and HTML are likely to be in the skill set of people in these positions, but the documentation for Jekyll and the Liquid templating language is sparse and lacking in detailed examples that someone new to the framework could draw upon while building their proficiency with these tools. Like with a CMS, Jekyll functionality can be augmented through the use of plug-ins — although the number of plug-ins supported by GitHub Pages, a common, free static-site hosting environment, is limited. While workarounds for the plugin restrictions exist, they impede a straightforward GitHub-based code management and site publication workflow. But even when plug-ins address basic functionality, shortcomings in a technical staff’s proficiency with Liquid make it difficult to implement design change requests or minor modifications to the design and layout of the site. Very specific design preferences are common in digital humanities projects managed by a minimally-technical principal investigator and implemented by people in other roles. While there are thousands of free Jekyll themes available, there is very little standardization in how they are implemented, and a solid grasp of Liquid templates is essential for any extensive modification.</p>
<h2 id="minimal-computing-in-digital-humanities-workshops">Minimal Computing in Digital Humanities Workshops</h2>
<p>The sheer number of components that go into setting up a Jekyll site, each of them unfamiliar to people with minimal prior technical experience, make it a poor choice for the 2- or 3-day digital humanities workshops for beginners that are commonly run during the summer or at the beginning or end of terms. The 2019 Slavic DH workshop at Princeton, for example, brought together scholars in Slavic languages and literatures from the US and Europe interested in digital humanities, with particular attention to precarious scholars and those without a local digital humanities community. The four-day event included two days of hands-on technical training in building exhibits of visual resources. For Andrew Janco and me, the co-instructors of the technical components, our first choice was to teach Wax, a Jekyll-based system for building exhibits. However, even a preliminary attempt to break down the process of creating a Wax site into discrete lessons that could fit into the schedule for participants made it clear that, realistically, we would be facing irate colleagues if we took this approach. For a minimally-technical audience, we would spend all of the first day walking them through and troubleshooting what might seem to them like arcane, extremely technical steps, before they saw anything that even vaguely resembled their own research materials in a web browser. It was a recipe for them to walk away concluding that digital humanities was too hard for them, that even something as simple as putting together a digital exhibit was impossibly complex.</p>
<p>If one of the goals of the past decade in digital humanities has been to make these tools and methods available to work based on materials outside the white, Western, patriarchal and usually Anglophone canon, done by people outside of well-funded research institutions, does the procedural complexity of minimal computing risk undermining those gains? What is the value of a technical approach that offers long-term sustainability, if the work that it would sustain is never built due to insurmountable technical obstacles? In response to these concerns, we ran the workshop using Omeka Classic, and participants were able to start assembling their items and exhibits and customizing their site design, using a graphical user interface, on the first day. A number of participants successfully continued their projects independently after the workshop was over.</p>
<p>An examination of the agenda for digital humanities workshops that  _have _ focused on minimal computing suggests that our decision to abandon Wax as a platform for a beginners’ workshop may not have been caused by deficits in our pedagogical capabilities or imagination. Short workshops (less than a week) that include Jekyll-based web development use it as an illustrative example. This includes making a case for  “reconcil[ing] cultural analytics and research architectures with struggles for justice ”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, using demos of existing minimal computing work as a starting point for developing a research agenda <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, or arguing for minimal computing as a way to improve reproducibility in the humanities <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Hands-on workshops for Jekyll are much rarer, particularly workshops targeted towards beginners. Jekyll was listed as one of the options (along with hardware like Raspberry Pi, which takes another perspective on minimal) for the week-long DH @ Guelph Summer Workshops in 2017. Keystone DH 2017 also included a practical, if not hands-on, workshop on Jekyll for collaboration <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, but the framing suggests the intended audience was people in technical support roles.</p>
<h2 id="human-labor-underwrites-minimal-computing">Human Labor Underwrites Minimal Computing</h2>
<p>Bridging the gap between the website that scholars want to be able to build and what they can easily do with Jekyll requires an intervention that combines technical expertise and emotional labor, in a ratio proportional to how much of the work a scholar must do independently. In the simplest case, a technical collaborator can give a scholar a template (such as the CSV file underpinning item generation in Wax) and walk them through how to fill it out correctly. The scholar then returns the template with the content filled in, and the technical collaborator does the rest of the work: correcting any inconsistencies in the data, cleaning any disallowed characters, installing and configuring Jekyll, and importing the data from the template. Configuring the site design to the scholar’s satisfaction may require a few iterations, but all together, creating a Jekyll site using this approach will likely take less than a week of the technical collaborator’s time.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  However, this level of hands-on development work on a scholar’s project may be outside the purview of the technical collaborator’s job. For example, when the technical collaborator is based in a library or IT unit, a common means of preventing demand from overwhelming the small number of technical staff is to limit their engagement with projects to  “consultation,”  unless their time is explicitly written into a project grant <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Reimagining the Jekyll web development workflow so that it fits into a series of  “consultations”  involves a shift from primarily technical labor that can be dispatched efficiently to primarily emotional labor that is much more complex and demanding to manage. Paige Morgan describes this kind of activity in a library context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people I work with are still substantially teaching themselves to get un-stuck, though I provide some specific problem-solving techniques. In these contexts, the emotional labor I perform for scholars as a digital humanities librarian is partly about offering confidence that they can learn that skill, even if it feels strikingly different from their existing abilities. It’s also about transparently disclosing some of the potential obstacles they might face, and which are hard for newcomers to imagine in advance. My goal is to underscore that obstacles, like bugs, are par for the course; and also, to give people a sense of what digital work involves so that they can decide whether it’s something that they want to pursue. I’m not interested in being an evangelist. <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of minimal computing consultation, it is difficult to avoid an undercurrent of evangelism. A model where the scholar passes off their project to a technical collaborator can make the use of minimal computing tools a guaranteed outcome, but an approach where the scholar does the work themselves requires ongoing coaching, consoling, and reassurance with each step, each error message, and each roadblock, whether it’s dependency conflicts, SASS challenges, variables behaving in surprising ways, or struggles with complex formatting in Markdown. There is a point at which the scholar can work independently on the project, barring any new functionality requests or divergent data, but until the scholar reaches that plateau, there remains a real possibility that the scholar will one day ask a colleague how they built their website, and adopt that tool like WordPress instead, or simply write off their digital project — if not digital humanities more broadly — as a frustrating time sink. Unless the scholar has invested so much time in configuring Jekyll and importing their data that they can’t possibly imagine starting over (even along an easier route), there is a risk that the scholar will stop scheduling follow-up meetings and replying to emails, only to re-emerge a year or two later seeking help with fixing their hacked WordPress site. Even when a project is successfully implemented, an ongoing sense of technical unease on the scholar’s part can stand in the way of their ongoing engagement and contribution to the project. Despite buy-in from the Scholars’ Lab community on a Jekyll-based site relaunch <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, ongoing uneasiness with the interface has reduced the number of website contributions by community members who have run into technical difficulties in the past and who feel like they should understand the technology after reading the documentation but continue to struggle with making it work <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There are development approaches besides all-or-nothing. In some cases, even under a strict consultation only model, a technical collaborator will simply take care of part of the work for a scholar, rationalizing that it would take less time and work better for everyone than trying to talk the scholar through doing the steps themselves. But this kind of shadow labor has pernicious long-term implications for the project. Under a model where the technical collaborator is responsible for most or all the technical work, they are likewise responsible for the technical maintenance and updates (from which minimal computing workflows are not wholly immune). Having a technical collaborator take care of part of the project creates a gap: the scholar walks away without understanding how that part of their project works, only relieved that it  _does _ work. This kind of hands-on help is usually undertaken with the intention of it being a one-time occurrence, but without the knowledge to manage that piece of the project or anyone else to turn to, the scholar will inevitably return seeking more help. Even more emotional labor is required to navigate those relationships and reassert boundaries after having stepped over the line once. While this scenario is hardly unique to projects that use minimal computing methods, the complexity and opacity of the technical components underpinning those technologies make it more likely for this kind of scenario to arise.</p>
<h2 id="articulating-the-problem">Articulating the Problem</h2>
<p>Minimal computing is offered as a solution to multiple problems, both distinct and overlapping <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. The environmental costs of server farms and the e-waste produced by continually upgrading computational hardware are one set of issues. Building a website using minimal computing methods may be part of a principled stand against the environmental costs of the digital world, but the ecological differences between a static website and a database-driven CMS are dwarfed by the impact of other personal decisions, which are themselves dwarfed by the impact of decisions made by governments and large corporations. Accounting for the additional time and effort that goes into learning how to build a minimal website rather than using a database-driven CMS, one could have a greater environmental impact by simply building a WordPress website and dedicating time to environmental activism instead of debugging Jekyll.</p>
<p>If the primary concern is a techno-aesthetic experiment, stripping down common tools and processes to the minimum of what we actually need  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>, then minimal computing is a highly suitable set of tools with which to prototype. Similarly, minimal computing can be one response to a sense of unease with the way that web authoring and publishing interfaces can alienate creators from the technical components underpinning their work. In the context of collaboration, it is important that this sense of unease be shared if it is used to justify the use of minimal computing methods. A technical collaborator who cites concern about a scholar’s alienation from their digital tools as the primary justification for imposing a complex minimal computing workflow runs the risk of being written off as an ideologue. While it is true that the individual skills that go into building a Jekyll site are reusable in other contexts, in contrast to the tool-specific knowledge that comes from working within a CMS <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, it is not unreasonable to argue that all those skills should not be a prerequisite for publishing one’s scholarship online.</p>
<p>If the primary concern is doing digital humanities work that can be made available to people who don’t have access to high-speed Internet, reliable connectivity, or high-performance hardware, this requires a different lens. Some kinds of graphically intensive virtual reality and augmented reality digital humanities work is out of consideration. Desktop software that is crucially dependent on cloud computing for computationally intensive processing (e.g. Transkribus for handwritten text recognition) should be ruled out. But even if we exclude anything involving specialized peripherals or high-end hardware, along with any software that needs to be installed to run, we are left with so much more than static HTML websites. WordPress, for instance, can be set up in a self-contained way on a USB stick or hard drive, which could be loaded full of digitized texts and images.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  Voyant Server, a GUI-based suite for text exploration and analysis, can similarly be run without Internet access or cutting-edge hardware. Portable versions of Python and Jupyter Lab make it possible to do more complex and customized forms of computational text analysis without local installation or internet connectivity. Language models can be trained using more robust computational resources and included for use in offline environments. Depending on the number of texts in question, even medium-scale computational text analysis is feasible with a modest laptop.</p>
<p>Creating web-based resources that do not require ongoing upkeep to remain functional — ideally, while minimizing custom code that itself can be a maintenance liability — is a holy grail of digital humanities <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. The prospect of spending a great deal of time building a website that will likely decay to the point of being unusable in five or ten years is appalling, particularly when compared to the expected longevity of physical books stored in a library. While some updates to the static site generation software itself may be needed if a scholar wishes to continue updating their site, the static HTML websites generated by such software are likely to be viewable as originally intended, even a decade or more later. An interest in preserving digital work in its original form may be the issue that drives scholars towards compromises on bells and whistles of website design, indirectly getting to the technical-aesthetic question of What is the least amount that we need? through the framing, What is the most we can do that can still be preserved? Technical collaborators could successfully advocate for simplifying the design and number of infrastructural components of a website in the name of preservation <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. The bare-bones authoring and finicky site configuration experiences offered by current minimal computing web tools is harder to justify. The goal of preservation is served by the creation of a static HTML website, and configuration stored in plain-text files rather than a database, but no added virtue is accrued through manual human authoring of those files or content originally authored using Markdown. Using static website generation software like Jekyll is already a compromise that brings with it dependencies, version conflicts, and added configuration hassle, in exchange for being able to do some things more easily than doing the equivalent with hand-written HTML. To enable more scholars to take advantage of the sustainability benefits of minimal computing websites, without passing a large amount of technical and/or emotional labor onto technical collaborators, it is time to prioritize infrastructural interventions that lower the barriers to minimal computing.</p>
<h2 id="maximizing-infrastructure-for-minimal-computing">Maximizing Infrastructure for Minimal Computing</h2>
<p>Digital humanities initiatives that have self-identified as infrastructure (including Project Bamboo and DARIAH) have a reputation for being large, expensive endeavors that struggle to articulate their goals, let alone accomplishments, in a way that scholars can identify the value they bring <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. A broader conceptualization of infrastructure is needed here, to encompass work that does not exclusively, or even primarily, serve the scholarship-driven goals of a specific project, but supports and enables the work of an arbitrary number of groups.</p>
<p>Infrastructure need not be primarily technical. Descriptions and flowcharts about where minimal computing approaches make more or less sense would be extremely valuable to help steer scholars to a suitable technical path. Step-by-step tutorials, particularly ones written without any assumption of prior technical knowledge, can make a tremendous difference in facilitating scholars’ independent use of minimal computing practices. The  <em>Programming Historian</em>  tutorial,  “Building a Static Website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages”   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>, is one of the few examples of this kind of resource for Jekyll, and it is a vast improvement over general-purpose Jekyll documentation with its detail and clarity.</p>
<p>Another highly scalable form of infrastructure is detailed documentation, ideally using discipline-relevant examples. The official Jekyll documentation is notable for its brevity. It largely depends on pointers to the documentation for Liquid, which is heavily shaped by e-commerce examples on account of its original creators: Shopify. Translating examples between domains is a skill that requires practice and experience, and it is demanding to ask scholars to both absorb a new syntax and imagine how it would apply in their project when given only examples based on digital shopping carts. Basic Jekyll and Liquid documentation designed for an intrepid but beginner digital humanities audience, using typical forms of scholarly projects as the basis for examples (as in <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>), would be very useful.</p>
<p>Ed (<a href="https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/">https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/</a>) and Wax (<a href="https://minicomp.github.io/wax/">https://minicomp.github.io/wax/</a>) are themes with additional built-in functionality to make it easier to build an online edition and exhibit, respectively. They represent another kind of infrastructure for doing minimal computing projects, but are both critically lacking in detailed documentation for how to customize them for use with one&rsquo;s own data. It is unclear which configuration options  <em>must</em>  be modified for a new project, which settings  <em>must</em>  be left alone, and in what circumstances one might want to make other modifications to the code. These projects, along with Jekyll plug-ins, multilingual configurations <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>, and other themes and snippets, would benefit tremendously not only from individual documentation, but also from write-ups in the style of Miriam Posner’s  “How Did They Make That?”  blog posts <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>, breaking down and explaining the configuration used by sites that combine these features in different ways.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a need for better technology to reduce the friction that many users experience when building minimal computing websites. There are multiple places where the kinds of small errors that humans are prone to — like putting the wrong number of spaces before a value in a _config.yml file, or incorrectly formatting the file name of a blog post to omit the date, or failing to escape one of the many characters that cause problems in Jekyll configuration files or front matter — can lead to frustrating and unexpected systemic failure. A graphical interface for authoring posts and managing site configuration, such as that offered by Netlify CMS,<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  would ensure greater consistency around those formatting quirks that Jekyll is sensitive to and could offer a more comfortable WYSIWYG environment. A system comparable to WordPress in terms of the affordances it provides users for authoring and configuration, but with the data-handling and templating capabilities of Jekyll, along with Jekyll’s static output and sustainability benefits, would be a compelling option for digital humanities web development. Multiple such solutions exist, both as commercial software-as-a-service offerings and a variety of open source projects, but additional work is needed to adapt the code to the particular needs of less-technical digital humanists (e.g., integration with Ed. and Wax-specific configuration settings).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The minimal computing movement offers relief to digital humanities developers weighed down by the ongoing hassle of managing and updating WordPress and other CMS sites whose bloated underpinnings, riddled with security holes, offer insufficient value for the cost of their upkeep. Implementing a scholar’s project using static site generation software such as Jekyll can vastly simplify both development and maintenance. However, for scholars who do not have access to a technical collaborator who can take care of the multiple distinct technical components, very precisely configured, that are required to create a Jekyll website, the calculus is more complicated. A WordPress site is more likely to offer a familiar interface,<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  and the ease of a one-click installer makes the complexity of Jekyll a much harder sell. Prioritizing minimal computing — whether for environmental, techno-aesthetic, or sustainability reasons — risks leaving behind scholars who lack the technical expertise or ongoing support to manage multiple facets of technical web development.</p>
<p>The sustainability and preservation benefits of minimal computing web development are significant, but for these benefits to be realized — particularly by scholars outside of well-funded research institutions with technical developers on staff and by scholars who are not comfortable reading technical prose in English — the digital humanities community needs to engage with building infrastructure to support that work. There are major deficiencies in current documentation, tutorials, and examples for minimal computing web development in digital humanities. Remedying these deficiencies requires clarity in writing, more than deep technical expertise. Scholars with a small amount of hard-won experience with Jekyll could have an impact by documenting their own processes — although this too requires labor without a corresponding immediate payoff for one’s own work. Building graphical interfaces that provide a more familiar authoring environment while offering an error-resistant means of configuring Jekyll sites would require non-trivial technical development, even starting from existing open source code. We will know we have built enough scaffolding when minimal computing web development can be taught to technical novices in one- or two-day workshops, with participants walking away comfortable with their ability to continue working independently on their projects. Until then, minimal web development, with all its associated benefits, is a luxury available to those with technical expertise, or the necessary money or connections to absorb the additional labor that this approach requires.</p>

<p>Early Arabic periodicals published across the Eastern Mediterranean from the mid-19th to the early 20th centuries were at the core of social developments and formative discourses of modern(izing) societies that carry continued prominence across the region and beyond, such as the Arabic (cultural) renaissance ( <em>nahḍa</em> ), Arab nationalism, and the Islamic reform movement ( <em>ṣalafiyya</em> ). Yet, the vast majority of journals and newspapers remain obscure and understudied beyond a few well-known titles from Beirut and Cairo. As physical artifacts — frequently printed with cheap ink on cheap paper and handled without care in transit — they are vulnerable to neglect and active destruction. Neoliberal defunding of cultural heritage institutions as a global phenomenon is compounded by an onslaught of iconoclasts, failing institutions, and wars ravaging Syria, Yemen, and Iraq.</p>
<p>Turning to Alex Gil and Élika Ortega’s question of  “What do we need?”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, the answer, therefore, is simple: preservation and access. Societies of the Global South have a right to unhampered access to their own cultural record — a cultural record that is frequently held by institutions of the Global North. Access would also allow the scholarly communities concerned with the histories of Middle Eastern societies to study them through their own cultural production.</p>
<p>Taking up this issue, the following paper consists of two parts. I begin with challenging the equation of digitization = access by outlining the layers of inaccessibility inherent in existing digitization efforts of textual cultural artifacts from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. The Eastern Mediterranean, between Mesopotamia in the East and the Libyan desert in the West, the mountains of Anatolia in the north, and the Arabian Peninsula in the south, is home to historically multilingual and multiscriptural societies. Predominantly Arabic speaking, the area was part of the Ottoman Empire for four centuries until the end of World War I. The material cultural heritage of these societies has been and continues to be looted, destroyed, and neglected, as exemplified by the recent scandal surrounding the Museum of the Bible in Washington or the destruction of Palmyra by the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Their textual cultural heritage resists digitization by being dependent on scripts other than Latin (such as Arabic, Armenian, Syriac, or Hebrew scripts) and calendars, as well as corresponding conceptions of time other than the Gregorian (such as the Ottoman fiscal or  <em>mālī</em>  calendar, the reformed Julian calendar, or the Islamic  <em>hijrī</em>  calendar). This is further exacerbated by their contemporary heirs&rsquo; relative lack of resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures when compared to the Global North. The second part introduces the project Open Arabic Periodical Editions (OpenArabicPE) as a practical critique of these layers of inaccessibility that creatively bootstraps existing data, tools, and infrastructures into a framework to produce and distribute open scholarly periodical editions drawing on the affordances of the Global South.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  I argue that OpenArabicPE demonstrates the feasibility of bootstrapping approaches by having published six full-text editions of Arabic journals originally published in Baghdad, Cairo, and Damascus between 1892 and 1918 with a total of 41 volumes comprising 645 issues, 12,830 pages that link to digital facsimiles,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  and more than six million words (Table 2), without any resources beyond voluntary labor and private laptops.</p>
<h2 id="inaccessibility-of-digitized-arabic-periodicals">Inaccessibility of Digitized Arabic Periodicals</h2>
<p>The first layer of inaccessibility is a knowledge gap rooted in the physical artifact and its history. Scholars have written on the late Ottoman periodical press of the Eastern Mediterranean since the early twentieth century <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and there is a plethora of encyclopedic work on the Arabic press <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>, listing titles and dates of first publication. Yet, the history of the vast majority of individual titles remains unknown, and only a handful of periodicals have been the subject of systematic studies <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. This is particularly true for all places beyond the traditional scholarly focus on Beirut and Cairo.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  If we were interested in the series of food riots that shook cities across the predominantly Arabic speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire in summer 1910 <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, we would not know which contemporary newspapers and journals from Homs, Hama, or Gaza could be consulted for reports on these events.</p>
<p>The second layer of inaccessibility is a direct consequence of the knowledge gap and can be summarized as a digitization bias rooted in collection bias and survival bias <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Publishers sought to minimize the cost of publishing, and, as a result, the durability of printed newspaper and periodical copies were not necessarily their primary concerns. Surviving copies are scattered across libraries and private collections around the globe. In the absence of a survey of collection histories, I deduce from the copies I have seen that many collections came about by chance and reflect local, regional, and global distribution networks more than specific collection policies. We must also take into account individual publishers’ agency in influencing collections through donations of library copies, even long after their publication. The Ottoman-Arab intellectual, journalist, founder of the Arab Scientific Academy, and Minister of Education, Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī (1876–1953), for example, established the monthly journal  <em>al-Muqtabas</em>  (The Digest) in Cairo in 1906. Kurd ʿAlī moved to his hometown of Damascus after the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, where he continued to publish  <em>al-Muqtabas</em>  until the end of World War I <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. In 1914, six years after its publication in Cairo, Kurd ʿAlī gifted a library copy of the second year of  <em>al-Muqtabas</em>  to his friend Jūrj Fākhūri. Two years later, he gifted another library copy of the same volume to the library of the Ṣalāḥiyya College in Jerusalem. The former is now held by the University of Minnesota and a digital facsimile can be accessed through HathiTrust. The latter ended up in the al-Aqṣā Mosque’s library in Jerusalem and was digitized by the British Library’s Endangered Archives Programme.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Preservation of these brittle materials is costly, and frequent, prolonged wars, regime changes, and economic crises continue to have a devastating effect on surviving holdings. The Lebanese National Library, for instance, was shut down and its collections, including extensive periodical collections, were hastily stuffed into boxes and stored in the port of Beirut in 1975, where they remained for the next forty-odd years. A rehabilitation project has been underway since 2003, and reading rooms were opened to the public in 2018, but the status of the periodical collections remains opaque.</p>
<p>Locating a specific title and issue or all titles published in a particular place is a tedious endeavor exacerbated by the state of online catalogs. Existing catalogs are not necessarily published or digitized beyond onsite records. The website of the Lebanese National Library, for instance, still advertises its catalog as forthcoming. Union catalogs, on the other hand, have fallen out of fashion and should probably be read as historical sources rather than finding aids <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Known and confirmable collections are predominantly located in the Global North and are frequently incomplete. Figure 1 illustrates the combined survival, collection, and cataloging biases with the example of  <em>al-Muqtabas</em> . Based on data from WorldCat and the Arabic Union Catalogue (ArUC), we can locate only nine complete collections worldwide: five in the US, two in Lebanon, and one each in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, including a reprint published by Dār Ṣādir in Beirut in 1992.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Digitizing and hosting digital artifacts are expensive, and the cost scales almost linearly. In order to justify their expenses, curators will almost always turn to the rare and beautiful. Hundreds of thousands of periodical pages in foreign languages are frequently not considered important enough to warrant this investment for institutions in the Global North. Funds, infrastructures, and access to the physical artifacts, on the other hand, are commonly not available in the Global South. In consequence, we witness a neo-colonial absence of the Global South from the digital cultural record <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. In the absence of aggregators or an index, specific titles are incredibly hard to find in the patchwork of existing collections of digitized periodicals. Figure 2 shows the distribution of all Arabic periodical titles published across the Middle East and North Africa between 1789 and 1929, based on <a href="https://projectjaraid.github.io/">Project Jarāʾid</a>, a scholarly crowdsourcing effort we have been running since 2012 to gather publication and holdings data. Based on this data set, only 504 or 15.59% of the 3232 titles could be located in collections and only 148 or 4.58% have been at least partially digitized <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The third layer of inaccessibility is one of socio-technical infrastructures: digital infrastructures, despite all promises towards the opposite, are rooted in the epistemic hegemony of late 20th-century, Anglo-American, neoliberal capitalism. Most digitized periodicals are kept in data silos without any means for interchange or interoperability in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs) or the option to download data in machine-actionable, standardized, open file formats. Reading access to these silos is frequently restricted by paywalls and geo-fencing, a method to restrict access based on the geographic location of a user’s IP address. Table 1 provides an overview of the accessibility of the ten largest online platforms serving digitized Arabic periodicals.  <em>al-Muqtabas</em> , for example, is commonly deemed in the public domain in the United States. Copies from the University of Minnesota and Princeton University are openly available online at HathiTrust — for scholars at member institutions and the general public in the U.S. as determined by a user’s IP address.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  Everyone else will see blank pages. Downloading content in order to circumvent ill-suited interfaces is often limited to individually identifiable users. Automated downloads frequently violate terms of use, and most vendors try to prevent this on the technical level — at least in one case, detected attempts of automated downloads will result in the vendor punishing subscribing institutions for violations from within their IP range with a blanket block.<br>

Proprietary web-interfaces are commonly neither tailored to the display of Arabic material nor themselves available in Arabic <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>, while bibliographic metadata is regularly limited to the issue level and is woefully inadequate. This is due to ambiguity of data found in the physical artifacts, such as ambiguous references to calendars in mastheads, limited knowledge about these artifacts among librarians and the contractors who did the actual digitizing work, and software stacks incapable of handling anything but Western scripts and hegemonic Western concepts of dates and names. In consequence, often incorrect bibliographic metadata are recorded and shared in transcription to Latin script — of which there are as many varieties as there are languages written in Latin script (see Figure 3) <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. Take for example, the Ottoman Turkish newspaper  <em>Yenī Taṣvīr-i Efkār</em>  from Istanbul. Holdings at the al-Aqṣā Mosque’s library were digitized through the Endangered Archives Programme. Ottoman Turkish was written in Arabic script until 1924. The catalogers transcribed a truncated title into Latin script but did so according to the rules for Arabic, which resulted in the grammatically wrong title  <em>Taṣwīr Afkār</em> . In addition, they provided Jerusalem as place of publication instead of Istanbul.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  Although practices have been improving in recent years and many catalogs can now display Arabic script, re-cataloging the original script is costly and not a priority for vendors.</p>

<p>The second aspect of socio-technological inaccessibility is the hegemonic approach of computational systems to script through the metaphors of discrete characters and typesetting and by conceptually equating scripts with (national) languages <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Yet, Arabic script is a writing system for many Asian and African languages <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. It runs from right-to-left, with most letters connecting within a word. Letters have up to four forms depending on their position within a string, while multiple letters share the same basic shape ( <em>rasm</em> ). Diacritical signs (dots) above and below the  <em>rasm</em>  have been introduced to unambiguously identify a letter (see Figure. 4). There are only a few exceptions to these script-specific writing rules across languages.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  However, dots are not strictly necessary for reading, and their use is subject to taste. Some regional cultural practices almost consistently omit them for specific letters, particularly at the end of words. Unicode — as a character-encoding standard that enables the vendor-independent exchange and interoperability of multilingual textual material of the networked age — does not adequately encode this cultural preference for ambiguity and forces transcribers to select a specific interpretation of the string in front of them. Transcribers have to either normalize orthographic variance or pick visually matching but wrong glyphs. On the other hand, because it is organized into (national) languages, Unicode provides multiple code points for the same glyph, introducing a potentially large variance in possible encodings for the same string of letters depending on the input keyboard of the transcribers. Egyptian Arabic speakers, for instance, would virtually never write the two dots underneath a final  <em>yāʾ</em>  (U+064A: ي). To mirror their cultural preference, they can either select the Arabic  <em>alif maqṣūra</em>  (U+0649: ى) or the Persian  <em>ye</em>  (U+06CC: ی).<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  Unfortunately, search algorithms built into modern operating systems are not aware of this variance, and any application software relying on them will return skewed results without additional efforts at regularization or a reduction to the  <em>rasm</em>   <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The fourth layer of inaccessibility is the digital artifact itself: Digitized periodicals commonly mean scanned images (facsimiles) with limited or no text layer due to the particular challenges of Arabic script for optical character recognition (OCR) and the difficulty in automated layout recognition for dense multi-column page layouts. In addition to the characteristics of Arabic script outlined above, and depending on font and writing style, letters will form ligatures. They will not necessarily sit on a single base line, and base lines can be tilted (Figure 4). Segmentation into letters as the traditional approach to OCR has consequently proven extremely complicated and error prone. Accuracy rates for leading Arabic OCR solutions are well below 75% on the word level <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>, which causes the Internet Archive to state that the  “language [is] not currently OCRable”  (e.g., <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>). This is about to change with recent developments in machine-learning based approaches to OCR and hand-written text recognition (HTR), from <a href="http://kraken.re/">Kraken</a>, to <a href="https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/">Transkribus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract</a>, which generally have shown to reliably produce high levels of accuracy independent of input language and script, including Arabic <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. The Open Islamicate Texts Initiative Arabic-script OCR Catalyst Project (OpenITI ACOP) will train recognition models for the most frequent fonts and types <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>, and their technology will eventually find its way into HathiTrust <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>. However, there is an important catch beyond the still unsolved layout recognition: machine-learning requires enormous resources — from labor time and the skills needed to use specialist software, to necessary hardware requirements and power consumption <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Commercial vendors and even some public institutions claim opaque break-throughs for in-house OCR technologies, but none share their software, evaluation reports, or even full-text layers (e.g., <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>). Instead, their interfaces foreground full-text search capabilities with hits superimposed onto the digital facsimiles. Exploratory searches often reveal a high number of false positives among the search results while the extent of false negatives, strings that should have been found but weren’t, and the veracity of full-text operations remains inherently unknown.</p>
<p>Finally, informal online libraries of Arabic literature, most prominent and popular among them <a href="http://www.shamela.ws/">   <em>al-Maktaba al-shāmila</em>   </a> (The Comprehensive Library, 2005–) <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>, provide access to a small number of full-text editions of Arabic periodicals based on the work of anonymous human transcribers. Unfortunately, they do not provide information on editorial principles, the quality of the transcription, or the material artifacts they were based on. In addition, such informal editions lack information linking the digital remediation to the original artifact, namely bibliographic metadata and page breaks, which makes them almost impossible to employ for scholarly research. In a final twist, I found that the informal editions from  <em>al-Maktaba al-shāmila</em> , with all their gaps and omissions, were rendered as images with a pseudo-original layout to provide  “fakesimiles”  and served through <a href="http://archive.alsharekh.org/">   <em>Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya</em>   </a> (Archive of Literary and Cultural Arabic Journals), the largest Arabic online platform for historical periodicals.<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>  While this reveals the cultural significance of seemingly faithful reproductions, the existence of such  “fakesimiles”  requires any scholar to exert additional scrutiny before using material from these informal platforms.</p>
<p>These four layers of inaccessibility have an already detrimental effect on any Arabic speaker from Syria, Jordan, or Palestine with only limited knowledge of foreign languages, particularly English, and no affiliation with wealthy institutions from the Global North. They are, however, further compounded by the infrastructural dependencies of digital remediations on access to devices, Internet connections, and electricity. Neither of these can be taken for granted for the societies of the Global South. In the — all too frequent — worst case, devices are old, Internet connections are slow, traffic is prohibitively expensive, and electricity is perilously scarce <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Because OpenArabicPE was set-up in and run from Beirut, Lebanon, I illustrate this multi-layered digital divide<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  with the Lebanese example: only 15% of inhabitants have access to a landline and less than 1% have a broadband subscription, while 73% have a mobile phone <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>. Many people rely on mobile Internet connections because wired infrastructures are insufficiently deployed or because they cannot sign up for a landline due to an unofficial rent agreement. They might also have no access to a personal computer or the necessary private space to use one due to cramped living conditions. Mobile internet connections, while by and large reliable and fast (4G), are prohibitively expensive. 20GB traffic or 30 days of service, whichever is less, cost about 40 USD, while at least 30% of the population lived on less than 120 USD a month in 2018 <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Consequently, plans to levy a daily one-dollar tax on the usage of widely popular WhatsApp ignited wide-spread popular protest against the government and the entire political class in October 2019. Electricity has been another major issue. For the last decades, rising demand could not be matched by constantly decreasing supply. The single, state-run utility relies on insufficient power plants and imported, subsidized fuel. Consequently, the capital city of Beirut has been suffering from regular daily power cuts of three hours, even before the accelerating economic collapse that commenced in 2019. Already at this point, electricity had been expensive and easily came in at about 120 USD per month per household despite having been heavily subsidized. Generator subscriptions to offset power cuts were equally expensive.<sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>  The situation has deteriorated since. At the point of writing, the local currency lost 94% of its purchasing power for buying the necessary fuel for generating power on the international market, and Beirut had about one hour of electricity per day.</p>
<p>The impact of these infrastructural realities is not only limited to individual users of digital cultural artifacts, but also severely impacts institutions planning to host them. At my home institution, a well-funded foreign research institute, for instance, we share a single connection of 24Mbps. Even under perfect conditions, simply loading the landing page for a single volume of  <em>al-Muqtabas</em>  at the Endangered Archives Programme requires three seconds. With 20 colleagues and another 20 library users all trying to access online services and resources, load time quickly multiplies tenfold and more. Browsing through a large number of scanned images behind such a bottleneck is a daunting task. Uploading multiple gigabytes of high-resolution scans to a cloud computing service for machine-learning based OCR, for instance, is practically impossible, and we prefer to ship hard drives and wait for months for the results.</p>
<h2 id="bootstrapping-for-access">Bootstrapping for Access</h2>
<p>I set up OpenArabicPE in August 2015 in order to address these socio-technical layers of inaccessibility of existing digitized Arabic periodicals with the affordances of the Global South and the tools at hand. Building on the guiding principles of simplicity and credibility for the sake of accessibility and sustainability, OpenArabicPE was inspired by Alex Gil’s talk at Digital Humanities Institute-Beirut, during which he introduced the audience to the ideas of minimal computing, and by discussions and workshops at the 2015 Digital Humanities Summer Institute. A second strand of inspiration came from ideas about crowdsourcing and democratic public domain editions based on distributed version control systems that had emerged from the open-source communities in the early 2010s <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>. The idea is simple: re-use — sometimes creatively — openly available data, tools, and infrastructures to produce and share open, collaborative, scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals. OpenArabicPE’s resources were and remain extremely constrained: we have no funds, no staff beyond volunteering interns, and no equipment beyond our own computers. OpenArabicPE, therefore, also represents (and reflects the changing boundaries of) our own ability  “to produce, disseminate, and preserve digital scholarship ourselves, without the help we can’t get, even as we fight to build the infrastructures we need at the intersection of, with, and beyond institutional libraries and schools”   <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. As such, OpenArabicPE constitutes a contribution to the digital commons <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup> and provides a practical critique of neoliberal capitalism along the lines of what Valeria Graziano, Marcell Mars, and Tomislav Meda have recently called  “pirate care”   <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-layer">The Data Layer</h2>
<p>On the data level, OpenArabicPE combines the virtues of immensely popular, but non-academic, informal online libraries of volunteers with academic and institutional scanning efforts and editorial expertise. We transformed the digital text of six Arabic periodicals (see Table 2) — published in Baghdad, Cairo, and Damascus between 1892 and 1918 from <a href="http://www.shamela.ws/">   <em>al-Maktaba al-shāmila</em>   </a> — from HTML (packaged as EPUB) into an open, standardized plain-text file format (XML) following the Text Encoding Initiative&rsquo;s (<a href="https://www.tei-c.org">TEI</a>) guidelines <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>. Additionally, we linked each page to digital facsimiles from various sources, namely the Endangered Archives Project, Translatio, HathiTrust, and <a href="http://archive.alsharekh.org/">   <em>Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya</em>   </a>. Each periodical issue is modeled as a single file to align with the original organizational principle of these compound texts. We then model each issue with light structural mark-up for articles, sections, mastheads, and bylines, as well as other bibliographic information.<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>  As far as possible, authors and locations are identified and linked to local and international authority files. Bibliographic metadata on every article and in common standardized formats such as BibTeX and Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) is then automatically generated from the modelled TEI XML source.<sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>  Thus, we provide the advantages of truly digital editions and a means to verify the text layer and our mark-up against facsimiles of the original artifact.</p>
<p><em>Al-Maktaba al-shāmila</em>  has been repeatedly evaluated for building scholarly corpora with a focus on distant reading approaches to classical texts <sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>. OpenArabicPE was the first to focus on modern genres and to expand this basis into reliable and citable digital scholarly editions. Going through two journals in our corpus for the purpose of locating page breaks also revealed some of  <em>al-Maktaba al-shāmila</em> ’s editing practices, such as the omission of all footnotes and terms in scripts other than Arabic from the transcription. Most of the journals made extensive use of footnotes and articles covering recent developments in technology and sciences at the turn of the 20th century, often providing French, English, and Latin terms for clarification, which makes such systematic omissions relevant for evaluating distant reading approaches to the texts. Other scholars already noted that  <em>al-Maktaba al-shāmila</em> ’s editors omitted Rashīd Riḍā’s commentary on the Qurʾān ( <em>tafṣīr</em> ) from their transcription of the monthly journal  <em>al-Manār</em>  (The Lighthouse) even though it accounted for more than one-fifth of the journal’s content <sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup>. A combination of algorithmic searches for uncharacteristically short pages with close reading of these pages further substantiated the hypothesis of human transcribers without quality control strategies such as double keying. Most omissions can be plausibly explained by common human errors: skipping a few words on a long line, jumping a small number of lines, or turning two pages at once. In other instances, transcribers left completely unmarked comments in the transcription itself, stating, for example, that they couldn’t read the following lines in the copy in front of them.<sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>  From these notes and common normalization of spelling variants, we can safely deduce that the transcribers were Arabic speakers. We are still looking for ways to adequately acknowledge their work beyond a generic reference in the metadata section of our TEI files.</p>
<p>Linking page breaks to facsimiles, although trivial, proved extremely labor-intensive because page breaks seemingly did not matter enough to the anonymous transcribers to be consistently recorded.

<p>TEI XML is certainly not simple and comes with a steep learning curve. Bidirectional XML with left-to-right tags and right-to-left text is not particularly accessible to readers and editors either, even if specialized XML-editing software would better support it (Figure 5). However, TEI is both sustainable and credible as an underlying format, and the direction of a script is only relevant if rendered on a two-dimensional surface for human readers and editors.</p>

<p>Presenting facsimiles and text side-by-side for the validation of the latter with the help of the former is core to OpenArabicPE’s claim of credibility. Therefore — and in order to make the editions accessible to readers with as little overhead as possible — we adapted the TEI Boilerplate to our needs (Figure 6).<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup>  TEI Boilerplate is based on the idea of directly rendering XML files in a user’s web browser by using the built-in support for XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations). This application of XSLT allows users to transform TEI XML into HTML on-the-fly and to tailor the structure and content of this HTML to the specific project needs. The HTML representation can then be styled with CSS and interacted with through Javascript, just like any other webpage <sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup>. Our heavily modified adaptation of the TEI Boilerplate stylesheets adds support for right-to-left scripts; the side-by-side view of page images and text; a table of contents; browsing to neighboring issues; stable links to articles, sections, and paragraphs; and machine-actionable bibliographic metadata on the article level, and the necessary support for the specific structural requirements of periodicals. Finally, we added a simple system to provide multiple localizations, and most parts of the (simple) interface are available in Arabic <sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The most obvious advantage of rendering XML files locally on the reader’s computer is the removal of dependencies on backend servers and Internet connections. Editions can be downloaded, distributed through USB keys, and run locally. Generating ad hoc and on-the-fly reading copies also removes the need to actively generate, maintain, and upload multiple derivative versions of our editions and guarantees that human readers will always see the latest version.</p>
<p>Linking to digital facsimiles already available on the Internet is the preferred option from our project’s point of view, as scanning, maintaining, and hosting large files is prohibitively expensive.<sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup>  But these facsimiles tax the readers as linked online facsimiles require stable, fast, and affordable Internet connections; loading our webview for a single periodical issue of 56 pages requires 8MB even though IIIF allows us to limit the quality of images to grayscale and a width of 800dpi. A simple parameter setting, therefore, allows users to switch off the loading of online facsimiles altogether. Downloading images once and serving them locally would be the preferred option, but it would most likely violate user agreements, licenses, and copyright depending on vendors and jurisdictions. Nevertheless, such downloads are rather trivial as links to the digital facsimiles are an inherent part of the TEI XML files’  <code>&lt;facsimile&gt;</code>  node.</p>
<h2 id="the-infrastructure">The Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Editions and tools are maintained on GitHub, a staple of the open-source software development and digital humanities communities since 2008 <sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup>. Built upon the open-source version control system .git, originally developed for the Linux kernel, GitHub provides an ever-evolving infrastructure for collaborative editing, including issue trackers and wikis for documentation. In this environment, each edit to our editions is transparently documented and credited to an individual contributor with their email address and a timestamp. GitHub also hosts the webview of our editions directly from the code repositories through GitHub Pages. Most importantly, GitHub is free to use as long as all code repositories are openly accessible to the public.<sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup>  This means that any reader spotting an error or omission can contribute their corrections or comments. The only threshold to participation is registering a free GitHub account and continued support for GitHub by Microsoft, which bought the platform in 2018 (see below).</p>
<p>Full-text search across the entire corpus is a core feature most users would expect to see implemented. There are at least three distinct aspects to this feature, none of which are easy to implement in a static environment. First, users want any search to be aware of our corpus’ structural mark-up. That is, any search should be able to return hits on a specific structural level, such as a volume, issue, section, or article. Second, users will want to see keywords in context (KWIC) to evaluate a potentially large number of hits and because we are used to hegemonic search interfaces. Third, we expect search engines to be smart in the sense that they are aware of linguistic peculiarities and allow for some orthographic and morphologic variance.</p>
<p>Distributing digital corpora of hundreds of periodical issues without a backend severely restricts the ability to search and browse across issues. String search on plain-text files, such as XML, is, of course, a basic functionality of any personal computer’s operating system and there are plenty of free and open solutions to leverage additional power for fine tuning queries through XPath or regular expressions (RegEx). For an expert user, this solution will satisfy the first two demands once they download the entire corpus. We will also gradually change our encoding scheme to one TEI XML file per article for each periodical issue once it is completely marked-up, in order to set a more useful default item level for file based search operations (these files will then be compiled into issues upon rendering by the webviewer). However, most users will not readily have the skills and tools for taking advantage of this approach. As a result, we have also turned to Google’s Programmable Search Engine and Search Console. This requires a Google account linked to the editions’ URLs, which, for various political and legal reasons, might not be an option for other projects.<sup id="fnref:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">97</a></sup>  Once set up, the Programmable Search Engine causes Google to crawl and index all editions and provides a basic Javascript snippet to integrate a project-specific Google search box into any website. Google’s spiders are not aware of the TEI XML or its structure as they crawl the HTML page generated by the webview, but the Programmable Search Engine provides KWIC and all the bells and whistles of Google’s algorithmic power. Moving to one file per article will again improve the granularity of this approach.</p>
<p>Browsing and searching bibliographic metadata, on the other hand, can be easily implemented. The free and open reference manager Zotero is another staple of the digital humanities community and beyond. Among its features, Zotero allows users to share an unlimited amount of bibliographic references for free through a feature called Groups. Zotero also provides a well-documented API for uploading, updating, and accessing all data beyond the user interface. This allows us to build and maintain a bibliographic index by hosting references to all articles in our corpus in a project specific Zotero Group. Each reference links to the relevant section in the periodical editions through a stable URL.<sup id="fnref:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">98</a></sup>  Readers can, therefore, use both Zotero’s web interface and the standalone client as a port of entry to the entire OpenArabicPE corpus.</p>
<h2 id="facilitating-re-use-through-licenses">Facilitating Re-use Through Licenses</h2>
<p>Within the academic framework in which we are operating, we depend on explicit licenses to facilitate the use and re-use of our data and tools.<sup id="fnref:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">99</a></sup>  We share all scripts with permissible MIT licenses whenever possible, and we assume that the content of periodicals published across the Eastern Mediterranean before 1920 is in the public domain even under the most restrictive definitions (i.e., U.S. copyright law) — an interpretation that is explicitly shared by U.S.-based vendors serving digital facsimiles. The enormous amount of human labor required for digitizing cultural artifacts, on the other hand, tends to be actively hidden by vendors and users. Within academic historiography, for instance, extensive use of digital surrogates instead of the physical artifact and reliance on their affordances remains an open secret: everybody does it but only few acknowledge this practice. This is evidenced by a search on JSTOR for references to the URLs of works from  <em>al-Maktaba al-shāmila</em>  in academic texts, which returned a grand total of only 16 journal articles and book chapters, some of which are shared with the 11 hits of a search for  <em>al-Maktaba al-shāmila</em>  (c.f., <sup id="fnref:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">100</a></sup>). Reasons for this omission range from a distrust of the digital, vaguely inspired by Walter Benjamin’s ideas on the loss of aura through mechanical reproduction of an artifact <sup id="fnref:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">101</a></sup>, to perseverance of the established order of things and, ultimately, deception. Licenses will not solve dishonest citation practices, but retaining copyright of our own editorial contributions in the form of a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license is at least a reminder that all contributors need to be transparently credited for their work.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenges-of-bootstrapping">The Challenges of Bootstrapping</h2>
<p>As has become clear above, the main advantage of bootstrapping is its reliance on open and free-to-use external services, tools, and data. This is also its greatest weakness, as all these services, tools, and data are beyond our control. Every one of these dependencies will eventually break. The only question is when they will do so. Our main mitigation strategies are open and widely supported standards to prevent lock-ins and loss of data, and a minimal software stack to keep the number of potential breaking points as small as possible. Mitigation strategies also depend on the evaluation of the relative importance of threats and components for the overarching goals of our project.</p>
<p>The data layer is at the core of the project. Once modeling and editing of a periodical issue in TEI is complete, this part of the data layer will remain fairly stable. This stability is documented by versioned releases of our editions at GitHub. Such versioned editions protect users from the inevitable content drift of digital editions and ascertains that a referenced edition hasn’t been changed in the meantime <sup id="fnref:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">102</a></sup>. GitHub, however, is a commercial platform owned by Microsoft since 2018. Like any other commercial platform, they might change their business model or go out of business altogether at any point in the future.</p>
<p>GitHub and competing platforms for distributed version control are, therefore, no solution for sustainable, long-term access. Long-term preservation and accessibility require costly continuous maintenance, which is out-of-reach for projects, such as ours, which cannot afford to pay running costs for years to come. Publicly funded data repositories, on the other hand, guarantee the integrity and availability of data for the foreseeable future. Zenodo is an open and free-to-use, E.U.-funded research data repository originally developed by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva. In addition to its core service of providing long-term archiving of digital data, Zenodo registers versioned Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and integrates with various Open Science infrastructures, such as scholarly aggregators of metadata or Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) for unambiguously identifying contributors. Zenodo also integrates with GitHub by automatically archiving each release of data and tools and recording all contributors as found in the .git repository. This makes it a perfect choice for our GitHub-centered workflow.</p>
<p>The combination of platforms for distributed version-control with public repositories provides the necessary accessibility and sustainability of our data layer. But our editions’ claim to credibility builds on the linkage between textual editions and digital facsimiles. These links to externally hosted facsimiles are the most volatile component of the data layer, and we already encountered three major instances of link rot. Two were caused by vendors moving servers and changing protocols: The British Library moved the Endangered Archives Programme to IIIF in 2017 and  <em>Arshīf al-majallāt al-adabiyya wa-l-thaqāfiyya al-ʿarabiyya</em>  moved to a new domain in 2019, while HathiTrust removed the facsimiles of Princeton’s copy of  <em>al-Haqāʾiq</em>  (vol.1, 1910) from the public domain without any explanation in 2016.<sup id="fnref:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">103</a></sup>  Such link rot inevitably requires a lot of manual labor to figure out the patterns in new URLs (if any) and to write the necessary scripts to update all TEI files. Derivative formats, such as bibliographic metadata, although part of the data layer and preserved on Zenodo, can easily be regenerated from the main TEI files whenever changes to the infrastructure or updated standards necessitate it.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web and web browsers are fluid environments that will gradually break the presentation layer. As this presentation layer depends on specific versions of software, standards, and infrastructures, its functionality and looks cannot readily be preserved and archived. TEI Boilerplate was the only viable option to render TEI files in the browser without a backend in 2015, and it still works. All major browsers continue to support XSLT transformation but with two limitations. First, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) has, in many cases, superseded XML as an exchange format for serialized (structured) data, and XSLT support is limited to version 1, which was superseded by XSLT 2 in 2007 and XSLT 3 in 2017. If browsers continue to support XSLT, it won’t be further developed. Second, browser vendors tighten the screws on security. Running XSLT transformations on local files is considered attempted cross-site scripting and, consequently, is aborted by Google’s Chrome browser. The Firefox browser will transform local XML files but only with remotely hosted XSLT. At the time of writing, only Apple’s Safari allows for rendering our editions without any Internet connection. In the meantime, the TEI community has spawned new and exciting infrastructures for presenting TEI-based editions to human readers. Based on the TEI Processing Model <sup id="fnref:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup>, the TEI Publisher provides a flexible publication and editing framework as long as one has access to hosted server space. The Javascript-based <a href="https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean">CETEIcean</a>, on the other hand, has matured into an alternative to TEI Boilerplate with the full support of the TEI consortium <sup id="fnref:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup>. All future developments of OpenArabicPE’s webview will therefore move to CETEIcean.</p>
<p>Hosting the webview is not a challenge in itself. There will always be services that provide hosting for the small amounts of data that our digital editions contain (Table 2) for free. They are, however, of varying convenience. Data might need to be copied from the code repository to the hosting provider. In this regard, GitHub pages is certainly the most convenient solution. It allows us to directly serve the TEI files from any branch of the code repositories, ensuring that the presentation layer always renders the latest version of the data layer. Switching providers will introduce a major instance of link rot for users of our editions. At a bare minimum, all URLs pointing from the bibliographic metadata to the editions will need to be updated. Renting a project specific domain, such as openarabicpe.org, will protect against such basic link rot for a small monthly fee, but it might require a credit card with the ability to transfer USD abroad, which is not necessarily available to projects across the Eastern Mediterranean. We have therefore decided to stick with the default domain provided by GitHub (openarabicpe.github.io).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper introduced our project, Open Arabic Periodical Editions, as a concrete response to the multiple layers of inaccessibility for the textual cultural heritage of the predominantly Arabic speaking societies of the Eastern Mediterranean. We demonstrate the possibility of bootstrapping existing data, tools, and infrastructures into a framework for producing and distributing open scholarly periodical editions. This framework addresses the constraints of material that resists digitization and operates within the socio-technical affordances of a particular region of the Global South. The problems and practical approaches outlined above are, to a large extent, not specific to digital editions of Arabic periodicals or the particular environment in Lebanon. All tools, workflows, and infrastructures can be readily adapted to other literary genres in different scripts and languages with very little effort. Documenting our approaches and workflows is a major, ongoing contribution to this effort.</p>
<p>With regards to project specific outcomes, OpenArabicPE has the potential to radically alter and influence an emerging field of Arab Periodical Studies by making this material accessible for computational methods <sup id="fnref1:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. The editions have been used as the necessary ground truth in initial efforts to train genre-specific models for machine-learning approaches to OCR with very promising results, in collaboration with Sinai Rusinek. Planned collaborations for improving layout-recognition algorithms will help to eventually remove the dependency on human transcribers and bring the digitization of the rich Arabic textual heritage on par with at least the smaller Western languages.</p>
<p>Beyond building infrastructures  “without the help we can’t get”   <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, OpenArabicPE highlights how minimal effort is frequently needed to improve existing infrastructures. Often, adding basic support for the  <code>@xml:lang</code>  and  <code>@lang</code>  attributes to XML and HTML environments with a little CSS snippet significantly improves their usability. Lobbying browser vendors to include a few lines to this end in their default CSS seems to be a worthwhile and achievable goal. In less optimistic terms, OpenArabicPE contributes to laying open the brutal neocolonial character of our contemporary knowledge infrastructures and digital economies. Character and text encoding standards, natural language processing and named entity recognition, ontologies, thesauri, and gazetteers (whether part of the semantic web or not) have all been developed without consideration of or input from the majority of human societies. OpenArabicPE is part of larger communities of practitioners that gravitate towards, but are in no way limited to, the Right To Left conference at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI), the Digital Humanities Institute-Beirut (DHIB), the Islamicate Digital Humanities Network (IDHN), the Digital Orientalist, or the Historical Middle East Data Alliance. Together, we are raising attention for the needs of Arabic-centered scholarship and right-to-left scripts more generally within the larger digital humanities community.<sup id="fnref:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup></p>

<p>What if minimal computing principles extended  “beyond computing done under some technological constraints”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but also were at the core of a global digital humanities commons? Could this commons model a set of shared principles and technologies to empower students and scholars to work autonomously on their own projects? With these questions in mind, researchers from the University of Maryland, College Park in the United States and the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, CONICET) in Argentina designed a joint course, delivered for the first time from September–November 2020, to teach minimal computing approaches to North and South American students. The class introduced students to digital publishing and textual scholarship with minimal computing presented as a shared set of values: use of open technologies, ownership of data and code, reduction in computing infrastructure and, consequently, environmental impact.</p>
<p>Minimal computing can be a solution for the development of projects in the Global South, where access to infrastructure such as web hosting or even reliable and affordable Internet access is limited for humanities students and faculty. Our course, which will continue through 2022 at minimum, positions minimal computing as an approach that can bring together students from the North and the South in the same class — through video conference and other means — to discuss and address the barriers and opportunities for a more open and equitable global digital humanities.</p>
<p>In this essay we will discuss: 1) the open and minimal technologies we use for teaching students to create digital scholarly editions and why we have chosen them; 2) the bilingual teaching materials adopted and why we chose them; and 3) how students collaborate online in Spanish and English in small cross-institutional groups using Spanish and English texts from early colonial times in the Americas.</p>
<p>Through our work on this course, we are not only offering training on specific minimal computing skills but are also contributing to much-needed analysis of the different technological and academic contexts around the world: issues related to infrastructure, language, digital literacy, and Open Science practices. We seek to raise awareness about the different kinds of digital humanities around the world, which will both benefit our students and make a case to the global digital humanities community that technology cannot be owned by anyone, but must be used and contributed to by all.</p>
<h2 id="from-global-to-open-digital-humanities">From Global to Open Digital Humanities</h2>
<p>While Anglophone digital humanities has established itself as part of many graduate and postgraduate programs, summer schools, centers, labs, books, and journals, the Latin American and Spanish humanidades digitales is still defining itself and pondering how to devise a curriculum of its own <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. However, both share a defining feature: their continuous growth as part of our contemporary digital and digitized world. This shared feature has led many scholars to redefine their work under the impact of the digital and to consider the consequences of a global turn that has put into question many aspects of their academic, linguistic, and technical practices <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The debate over a global digital humanities resulted in a considerable shift in 2013 when the Global Outlook Digital Humanities (GO::DH) Special Interest Group of the Alliance for the Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) was founded. GO::DH pointed out the importance of problematizing digital humanities as a field built and understood from multiple perspectives <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, something that the Alliance for Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) addressed both in DH2015 in Australia — named  <em>Global Digital Humanities</em>  — and in the panel on diversity in the field of digital humanities at DH2016 in Kraków <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This trend is also confirmed by the annual Global Digital Humanities Symposium that has been taking place at Michigan State University since 2016 and in initiatives such as the IFLA Special Interest Group<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  and the Asociación Argentina de Humanidades Digitales (AAHD) 2016 conference,  <em>Local Constructions in Global Contexts</em>   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  Another relevant event that proves how the global dimension of digital humanities has had an impact on its organizational core is the process initiated in 2016 with the goal of changing the governance and the financial model of ADHO, expanding its boundaries to regions of the Global South <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite the benefits that we could expect from a global digital humanities, it is crucial to remember that the concept of the global is complex and even contradictory, especially when related to technology in all its facets. In the context of global digital humanities, technology includes: software architecture, or the availability and cost of software solutions and the expertise to develop and adopt them; infrastructure as hardware, or the availability and cost of computers, peripherals, and other instruments capable of supporting the research software and approaches a digital humanities project may need; and infrastructure as long-term preservation, or the strategies, data management plans, and institutional support needed for guaranteeing the availability of digital humanities research outputs in the future. This technology, as Anne Cong-Huyen argues, is never neutral or truly global:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[D]igital and electronic technologies are of particular importance because they are often perceived as being neutral, without any intrinsic ethics of their own, when they are the result of material inequalities that play out along racial, gendered, national, and hemispheric lines. Not only are these technologies the result of such inequity, but they also reproduce and reinscribe that inequity through their very proliferation and use, which is dependent upon the perpetuation of global networks of economic and social disparity and exploitation.<br>
<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><br>
The term  “global”  moreover, is itself a paradox: global impacts are perceived differently at local and regional levels, and there is no single and unique process of globalization, but rather a set of different processes with global dimensions. For example, while Global North digital humanities scholars have focused on understanding diversity and awareness of linguistic privilege, interrogating the degree to which global technological practices can exclude participation in the field <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, the Spanish-speaking humanidades digitales situation is multifaceted. Undoubtedly, even though Spain and many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean share a language, their social, cultural, epistemic, and economic contexts are completely different. Spain is a country in the European Union, while Latin America is the most unequal region in the world that groups more than twenty countries that have been experiencing the impact of labor-saving technologies since the beginning of the century <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Also, it is important to note that in Latin America the free, public dissemination of research has long been understood primarily as a public good managed by the academic community. Scielo, the largest open access harvesting platform in the region, was founded in 1997, five years before the 2002 meetings in Budapest, Bethesda, and Berlin that produced the first open access declarations <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Non-commercial, open access publication — without article processing charges (APC)<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  — is the standard method of dissemination in Latin America and is widely understood as a key engine of knowledge democratization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reflections on how digital humanities could benefit from open approaches such as these have been part of manifestos and debates in the last ten years but have rarely been systemized. Todd Presner made the first emphatic assertion:  “The digital is the realm of the open: open source, open resources [&hellip;]. Anything that attempts to close this space should be recognized for what it is: the enemy”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. One year later, the Paris Manifesto focused on the technical aspects of what open means in digital humanities:  “[W]e call for open access to data and metadata, which must be documented and interoperable, both technically and conceptually”   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. However, many other scholars use the term open to represent values of collaboration <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> or authority <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  In the past few years, in part due to the influence of scholars from the Global South, the concept of open digital humanities scholarship has been given greater consideration. In a workshop at the 2018 ADHO conference, the debate was framed in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would it take to bring DH [digital humanities] into a more global openness, not only in terms of access but also in terms of methods, best practices and opportunities for collaboration? And what could this openness look like set against the backdrop of the long-standing and highly developed open access movement in Latin America and the Caribbean? <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any reflection on a global digital humanities should think and teach our students about the many important questions related to power and inequality, like the extreme asymmetry in research outputs between scholars from well-resourced and not-so-well-resourced countries, sometimes understood in terms of Global North and South <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. And by outputs we do not only mean articles or books, but also the core of digital humanities scholarship: online web-based projects and the ways in which we teach them.</p>
<h2 id="open-and-global-digital-scholarly-editing-through-minimal-computing">Open and Global Digital Scholarly Editing through Minimal Computing</h2>
<p>In recent years, Open Science has emerged as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods.<br>
<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> <br>
Digital technologies and infrastructures play a significant role in the open dissemination of knowledge. Surprisingly, even though  “Digital Humanities is a technologically embedded field”  and  “epistemic technologies are bound to play a significant role”   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>, digital humanities critical literature hasn’t focused on the benefits of Open Science for enabling collaborative, scalable, and long lasting global research.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  For example, digital scholarly editing and digital scholarly editions (DSEs) are not always perceived as open.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If editing is  “without doubt one of the oldest scholarly activities within the Humanities”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>, DSEs are at the core of digital humanities <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. While not all textual scholars might rely on the same definition of DSEs, they recognize their features and uses <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. Free, open standards such as the ones developed by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), along with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) technologies, such as eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) and XQuery, and dedicated software<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  have characterized the digital editing field. The scholarly editions themselves, however, haven’t always been successful as open products of research. Bodard and Garcés posed this issue when they claimed that, analogous to the Open Source Software movement, DSEs — which they call Open Source Critical Editions or OSCE — should be licensed for reuse, including all sources, data, methods, and software <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. While it is common practice to make TEI data publicly available, the debate over how DSEs need to be structured to be truly open is still ongoing and best practices have yet to be established. Vanessa Hannesschläger, for example, has recently surveyed licenses appropriate for DSEs powered by TEI and singled out Creative Commons ones as appropriate for an international context and for enabling an open culture of reuse with a global impact; however, there has yet to be widespread agreement with this proposal <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.</p>
<p>From a Global South perspective, the DSE field is perceived as being dominated by standards and technologies that are still unfamiliar to scholars; not surprisingly, these methods are typically described in the context of Anglophone projects <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. Indeed, beyond some very specific projects and initiatives, multilingual resources related to DSEs, such as tutorials, software, books, and articles, are generally difficult to find in languages other than English. Moreover, the use of proprietary software for most editorial work has become a barrier for extending the DSE practice beyond Northern academies.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  Indeed,  “[d]igital scholarly editions are expensive to make and to maintain”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. As such, long-term web hosting, preservation, and access to servers pose a significant obstacle for not-so-well-funded scholars who lack access to grant funding or other institutional resources. Overall, DSEs require substantial infrastructure and advanced technical skills, while diverse needs, capacities, priorities, languages, and academic traditions may require different features from DSEs at a global scale.</p>
<p>With that in mind, how can DSEs, one of the crown jewels of digital humanities <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>, become global? From our perspective, this can be achieved by establishing a digital commons.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  When the GO::DH Minimal Computing Working Group started a debate on power and inequality in digital humanities from a technological perspective, its intention was not to simply criticize or mourn a lack of diversity, but to establish an alternative discourse and create a new set of commons, namely technology of disobedience, architecture of necessity, and the moral modulor <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>. The principles of minimal computing turned into new ways of undertaking digital humanities work and collaborating to building an alternative digital epistemology that has found a practical outlet in minimal DSEs with Ed.,<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  a tool for building minimal DSEs without elaborate text encoding.</p>
<p>For these reasons, minimal computing informed the design of our joint course that teaches digital publishing and textual scholarship with minimal computing and text encoding. Specifically, we highlighted minimal computing as a shared set of values such as the use of open technologies, ownership of data and code, and reduction in computing infrastructure. The following question drove our course development:  “Could minimal computing provide a set of shared principles and technologies to empower students and scholars to work autonomously on and have more control over the future of their own projects?” <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  We further considered:  “What if minimal computing extended beyond ‘computing done under some technological constraints’ by standing at the core of a global Digital Humanities commons, overcoming notions such as center and periphery, North and South?”  and  “Could minimal computing serve as a common ground for Northern and Southern digital humanists?”</p>
<p>In Latin America, conversations on open and free technologies have been part of the Open Science agenda since the early 2000s, when the term  “technological sovereignty”   <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> began to be used by Latin American activists who wanted to have more control over the software that they and their governments used. The Latin American Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement is aligned with the Latin American Open Science movement. Both share a strong sense of common ownership for the common good. Based on this, many networks like reGOSH have highlighted how the region could benefit from the development of open scientific tools, as a way of overcoming dependence on equipment suppliers in the Global North and increasing its digital autonomy.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  However, as we discussed above, Latin American countries have the most unequal income distribution in the world which results in research inequalities across the region <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. As a result, the allocation of resources for research in Latin America is in great disproportion to those in developed countries. This is the case of HD CAICYT Lab, the digital humanities laboratory at Argentinian CONICET, which has been doing digital humanities research with very limited funding and technological support from the institution since 2016.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  The lab, nonetheless, carries on work in an open research context aligned with the Argentinian national law on open access and the Open Science environment in Latin America. HD CAICYT Lab has been creating minimal editions via a workflow built around Recogito, an open source semantic annotation software developed by Pelagios Network <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>, incorporating TEI markup and rendering the edited texts in static sites built with Jekyll and GitHub pages. In 2016, Susanna Allés-Torrent led a minimal computing workshop at the Second International Conference of the Asociación Argentina de Humanidades Digitales (AAHD) in Buenos Aires, Argentina <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. Scholars who attended the event felt empowered by the possibility of working autonomously on their own editions, and minimal computing was understood as a solution for the development of projects where access to infrastructure such as web hosting or even reliable and affordable Internet access is limited for humanities students and faculty. For our lab, HD CAICYT, minimal computing turned into the solution for computing done under technological limitations, as well as for  “producing our own scholarship ourselves”   <sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Minimal computing has become part of HD CAICYT Lab’s digital humanities standards and commons, integrating with our principles of openness: open corpora, documentation, collaboration, software, and publishing <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  Since the Lab is unable to buy software or pay for servers and hosting, adopting minimal computing strategies created the conditions necessary for our work to be part of the global digital humanities landscape. As such, we practice minimal computing beyond its definition of simply  “computing done under some technological constraints”  as it becomes our primary instrument for any form of digital humanities.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup></p>
<p>The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland has adopted minimal computing strategies primarily for digital preservation. MITH migrated a number of websites and web applications to static sites in order to reduce infrastructure demands and increase their longevity <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> and posed the minimal computing archetypal question:  “What do we need?”   <sup id="fnref2:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> as one of the guiding principles for future and current projects. In working with communities in and around the University of Maryland campus, MITH staff works with and trains collaborators around minimal technologies that allow them to curate, maintain, and, most importantly, own community archives independently of MITH’s and the university’s infrastructure.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  More specifically to DSEs, the prominent Shelley-Godwin Archive (S-GA) <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> has adopted technologies atypical for a TEI-based project from the start, with an eye towards Linked Open Data integration<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  and towards the reduction of the infrastructural footprint of the project. This led to a case-study experiment aimed at enabling offline use of the archive inspired by minimal computing principles to  “increase its availability to a larger number of communities with variable access to the Internet”   <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. TEI publishing in S-GA is handled directly in the browser, avoiding server-side transformations typical of many TEI projects that require substantial server infrastructure to be maintained and kept online long term. Partly informed by this experience, Raffaele Viglianti worked with Hugh Cayless on CETEIcean,<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  a JavaScript library for publishing TEI (and other XML) documents within an HTML page <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The different approaches to minimal computing and DSEs, context-dependent for HD CAICYT Lab and strategic for MITH, formed the basis of our collaboration on the course that we teach to undergraduate students in Buenos Aires and Maryland: Digital Publishing with Minimal Computing. Our combined experiences present our students with a perspective on minimal computing that is not entirely dependent on digital humanities practices in the Global North, but rather one that is based on a shared digital commons. Focusing on minimal computing allows us to teach the fundamentals of scholarly editing and digital publishing through free and open tools while engaging with issues of content ownership on the web that extend beyond textual scholarship. Our course challenges students to publish without relying on institutional infrastructure while keeping a critical eye towards commercial infrastructure, particularly in relation to data ownership and preservation. While this comes with an initially steep learning curve for discovering and adopting new digital tools, it also teaches students how to manage the fate of the resources they create.</p>

<p>In December 2019, we proposed a course titled Digital Publishing with Minimal Computing: Humanities at a Global Scale<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  to the Global Classroom Initiative (GCI) program at the University of Maryland. This program offers support for the development of courses to be taught in collaboration with a higher education institution outside of the United States, with the goal of establishing courses that expose students to work that is cross-cultural, project-based, and virtual; the GCI argues that these courses mirror the work students will encounter throughout their lives. While this outcome is somewhat dependent on the students’ career choices and opportunities, it is evident that  “globalization shrinks the world, bringing a wider range of cultures into closer contact than ever before ”   <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. Thus, preparing students to participate in a globalized world is a worthwhile goal, particularly if this can be done in a way that fosters intercultural competences.<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>  The COVID-19 pandemic also exacerbated the virtual nature of this contact, as we adapted to rely even more heavily on technological links to collaborate both locally and globally.</p>
<p>The course, which involves students from the Universidad del Salvador (USAL) in Argentina and from the University of Maryland (UMD) in the United States,<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>  has received funding for at least three iterations between 2020 and 2022, with a blend of online and in-person learning.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  It is centered around a group project in which students collaborate virtually to create a bilingual (Spanish and English) digital edition of a multilingual colonial era text,<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  while learning about digital humanities approaches to literary studies, digital publishing, and history. The group project involving students from both institutions facilitates the cross-cultural collaboration that is central to GCI courses. Project-based learning is also an effective learning paradigm in which  “students actively construct their knowledge by participating in real-world activities similar to those that experts engage in, to solve problems and develop artifacts”   <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This approach is not unfamiliar to digital humanities pedagogy <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>, given that digital humanities research itself tends to be scaffolded through project work that results in the development of artifacts such as tools or digital publications <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. It is also connected to a multiliteracies approach, which brings together linguistic diversity and multimodal forms of expression and representation in response to changes in globalized technological environments such as the Internet, and the growing linguistic and cultural diversity due to increased transnational migration <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Teaching through a minimal computing lens, moreover, greatly benefits from projects that exhort students to think both globally and locally by recognizing the technological affordances they have access to (as well as why and how) and by confronting the limitations and constraints that work against them, whether in hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or indeed self-imposed limitations for pedagogical purposes. In other words, we train our students to recognize the privileges of having access to state-of-the-art computational resources as well as to devise strategies to circumvent limitations they may encounter by adopting minimal computing techniques. Students (and experts) from both cultural contexts are likely to encounter such limitations to varying degrees. Even those who have access to infrastructure through their institutions or future employers will encounter issues with preservation and portability of the digital publication projects that they have created. Learning to deploy minimal approaches can contribute to the viability of a digital humanities project and give students greater control over the future of their own work. This mimics and models to our students the role, as we have discussed above, that minimal computing can play in establishing open and global approaches for digital humanities research and pedagogy that willfully reduce the gap between Global South and Global North contributions.</p>
<p>The nature of the cross-border collaboration between students is online and virtual, given their geographical separation. They attend virtual lectures and collaborate online via messaging and code sharing platforms, with the support of the instructors. This kind of engagement is often referred to as  “Virtual Exchange”   <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup> or  “Collaborative Online International Learning”  (COIL) <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>. The COIL Institute for Globally Networked Learning in the Humanities at the State University of New York was among the first to explore the applicability of this approach to humanities disciplines through an National Endowment for the Humanities grant. The final white paper reports on the twenty-four courses taught as part of the project and summarizes the surveys completed by instructors and students <sup id="fnref1:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>. The results highlighted how COIL courses offer a form of internationalization at home and a low-cost alternative to study abroad exchange programs, which are typically accessible to a very limited number of students, at least in the United States <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>. More importantly, the study identified clear merits of a project-based, cross-cultural approach to education in the humanities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To no surprise, most [survey respondents] cited the access to different cultural points of view as adding that something extra to the course. They found that this element increased student motivation, led to more in‐depth learning and helped students be more willing to see ideas, texts, works of art, etc. from different perspectives. In some ways it was as if the students felt they had to perform better because they saw their partner class as a new audience particularly during synchronous audio/video sessions and in asynchronous discussion forums.<br>
<sup id="fnref2:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup><br>
Our course applies the COIL approach to teaching digital scholarly editing through the lens of minimal computing, which, in itself, is an instrument for fostering international competencies in both student and expert work towards a more open and global digital humanities practice. Creating a course of this kind is necessarily a collaborative process that takes time and requires exchange of ideas among instructors. Over the seven months between first developing our GCI project and the first iteration of the course in September 2020, we discussed our pedagogical priorities, developed the syllabus, and created multilingual student resources such as slides, tutorials, and guidelines.<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>  English is typically assumed to be the language of global communication, playing an important role in both disseminating and seeking out information. As Ana Balula and Delfim Leão argue,  “In terms of information availability, which underpins the co-construction of knowledge, the use of English as lingua franca promotes the dissemination of research outputs and breakthroughs”   <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>. Nonetheless, Ángela Giglia highlights the more localized nature of humanities discourse:  “SSH [Social Sciences and Humanities] research is often grounded in specific cultural or geographical areas, hence the persistence of native languages opposed to English as lingua franca in STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]”   <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>. Multilingualism and bibliodiversity, or the diversity of academic content, are essential both at the national and international levels to preserve research in a wide range of global and local topics, studied from different epistemic and methodological approaches and inspired by various schools of thought and expressed in a variety of languages <sup id="fnref1:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We conduct shared lectures and communication between students in each group in English but facilitate learning and project work by providing bilingual course material. Because language is a primary medium in the transmission of culture and ideas, we also assign readings in both languages, trying to find papers that deal with similar topics and allowing students to choose between them <sup id="fnref1:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>  This is meant to both facilitate content acquisition and expose students to contributions that are not exclusively Anglo-centric when learning about digital humanities and DSEs in particular.<sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>  Moreover, we have seen that exposure to both languages enhances the virtual exchange experience;<sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>  in addition to learning from bilingual resources, the groups create bilingual websites and work with source material in both languages. In adopting this strategy, we are following UNESCO’s report on intercultural competences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multilingualism (communicative competence in multiple languages) and translation (conveying the same idea through different languages) are [&hellip;] requirements for intercultural dialogue, and indications of intercultural competences, enriching each group’s understanding of the other(s) as well of themselves. <sup id="fnref1:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In preparing bilingual materials for the course, we kept these principles in mind and invested time in creating resources that would be useful outside of the immediate course context. To date, our primary contribution has been translating Amanda Visconti’s Jekyll tutorial on the  <em>Programming Historian</em>  into Spanish.<sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>  This translation not only involved lexical and grammatical choices but also extralinguistic adaptations such as changing the screenshots. This decision was motivated not only by the presence of text in English in the images but also by the layout differences between the macOS and Microsoft Windows. The original tutorial is based on macOS and is infrequently used by Latin American students because of the elevated price of Apple computers. In order to make the tutorial accessible to our public, we provided priority to installation instructions for Windows and reproduced all the visual aids for a Windows environment.<sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>  We also created an extension to the free code editor Visual Studio Code, called Scholarly XML,<sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>  that provides functionalities essential to learning and encoding TEI, such as XML validation and code completion suggestions. Despite their function in TEI pedagogy, these features typically require complex installation or are otherwise only available through commercial software.<sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup></p>
<p>Since the majority of minimal computing aspects of the course are centered around project-based learning (PBL), we conclude this section by describing how we scaffolded the course activities through Joseph Krajcik and Phyllis Blumenfeld’s five key features of project-based learning <sup id="fnref1:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. The first feature is identifying a driving question that relates to authentic activities undertaken by researchers in digital humanities (more specifically in digital textual scholarship), such as,  “How do websites help us give new life to historical texts?”  Second, we explore the driving question via  “situated learning”   <sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup> — that is, by working in a real-world context. Minimal technologies for building websites allow our students to learn by doing with tools that make it feasible to engage with the driving question, but that are also used by professionals to develop open digital humanities artifacts. The third feature is engaging in collaborative activities to solve problems; students tackle the question and learn skills in groups made of individuals from both institutions, which, as explained above, is essential to the development of intercultural competences. The fourth feature recommends that PBL be  “scaffolded with learning technologies that help [students] participate in activities normally beyond their ability”   <sup id="fnref2:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. In our case these technologies include bilingual learning materials and online collaboration channels that we establish together with the students’ input. While minimal computing technologies should, by definition, be within the students’ ability, our goal is to have the students leverage these technologies to answer the driving question and engage with textual scholarship work that will likely be unfamiliar to them. Finally, the fifth feature is that students create artifacts that address the driving question and that are  “publicly accessible representations of the class’s learning”   <sup id="fnref3:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. Through structured assignments, each group creates a bilingual public website containing the encoded and edited text, together with paratextual content documenting their collaborative process and their engagement with the driving question.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In designing this course, we have had the unique opportunity to bring together digital humanities and humanidades digitales practices from the Global North and South. This joint effort has prompted us to reflect on what is common and shareable in our approach to digital scholarly editing: how, and in what ways, is knowledge exchanged in different cultural, linguistic, and technological literacies?</p>
<p>Minimal computing, understood not just as a response to technological constraints, but rather as an intentional methodological stance, strikes us as fundamental for building a shared commons that is both open and global. Moreover, we are building a bilingual syllabus (readings, tools, and project-based learning activities) centered on minimal computing as a way of countering epistemic and knowledge inequity <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Our work purposely moves beyond a North-to-South approach to curriculum and knowledge exchange to a synergetic North-and-South one, aimed at empowering knowledge creation in the language(s) in which an individual is most comfortable.</p>
<p>We are aware that minimal computing, and to some extent project-based learning, are approaches developed in the North, and adopting them under the guise of an internationalization agenda brings risks, such as overlooking local practices when building and sharing knowledge in the classroom. We are also conscious that while technology can increase access to knowledge, it may entrench cultural imperialism. Nonetheless, we envision a middle ground by adapting tutorials and educational materials, as well as balancing Spanish and Anglophone authors in the bibliographies students should be reading. In this sense, our course emphasizes a pedagogy of multiliteracies and a polycentric digital humanities perspective.</p>
<p>The first iteration of the course in 2020 concluded successfully, with an enrollment of 23 students (11 at UMD and 12 at USAL). After the course, USAL students continued to collaborate through presentations on their experiences with minimal computing at different events, including a presentation <sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup> at  <em>#NoviembreHD</em> , a one-month congress organized by the Argentine Association of Digital Humanities (AAHD) <sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup>, and a poster at the Global Digital Humanities Symposium, organized by the University of Michigan <sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup>. Several students also started their own digital publishing projects with the technologies they learned.<sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup>  This is evidence that the course is not only creating a favorable environment for collaboration and exchange, but also is providing participants with the tools for independent work in the field of digital scholarly editing.</p>
<p>By preparing for this course, we not only developed training on specific minimal computing and text encoding skills, but we also engaged with different technological and academic contexts around the world by addressing issues and perspectives related to infrastructure, language, digital literacy, and Open Science. Our continued challenge is uncovering how our work teaching minimal computing can effectively advance a more open and global digital humanities. We aim at moving beyond the limits of the course itself, by upholding approaches to pedagogy and digital humanities research that work towards what we claim should be a core tenet for the global digital humanities community: that technology should be owned by no one and used and contributed to by all.</p>

Acarete&rsquo;s travels were published in his native language, French, in the  <em>Relation des voyages du Sr… dans la rivière de la Plata, et de-là par terre au Pérou</em>  in 1672, as part of volume IV of the famous Thevenot _ Collection of Relations De Divers Voyages Curieux_ , and in 1696, independently, in the  <em>Relation des voyages dans la rivière de la Plate</em> . Two years later the 1698 London edition came to light in a collection entitled  <em>Voyages and Discoveries in South America</em> , and later as an individual book by Samuel Buckley&rsquo;s printing press as  <em>An Account of a Voyage up the River de la Plata, and Thence over Land to Peru: With Observations on the Inhabitants, as Well as Indians and Spaniards, the Cities, Commerce, Fertility, and Riches of That Part of America</em> . It was later translated from English to Spanish by Daniel Maxwell, and published in  <em>La Revista de Buenos Aires</em> , in May and June 1867, as  <em>Relación de los viajes de Monsieur Ascarate du Biscay al Rio de la Plata, y desde aquí por tierra hasta el Perú, con observaciones sobre estos paises</em> .&#160;<a href="#fnref:64" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Making is a fraught process. As Dave Gaertner notes, the maker movement is “deeply rooted in the colonial heteropatriarchy,” favoring activities that result in increased capital — the development of technical skills and the production of new technologies, rather than the relationships between makers and their communities <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. So, how can digital humanities — a field deeply invested in maker culture — develop strategies for people-first approaches to technology?</p>
<p>Makers by Mail, a project launched in 2016, was developed as a people-first approach to making. Inspired by projects like the DHMakerBus, as well as the fields of public humanities and, more recently, digital community engagement (DiCE), we sought to develop a maker community that  “leverage[d our] knowledge of the digital as a tool of community building”   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Aware that  “[t]he standpoints of the marginalized, the knowledge that is generated from their unique and particular social locations, thus offers important epistemological resources in any quest to create a more just world,”  we sought to build a making community responsive to the needs and positionalities of our users <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. We cite Virginia Eubank’s  _Digital Dead End _ specifically because, like Makers by Mail, it challenges the construct of the  “digital divide”  by promoting community-engaged technology praxis based on active listening,  “a process that repositions expertise”  as belonging to the user rather than a project developer or institution <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Makers by Mail accomplished these goals by developing a new maker infrastructure — one that sent makers materials directly to users and that developed kits and teaching materials based on their needs and feedback. Specifically, Makers by Mail shipped technologies to community partners via Priority Mail, a consistently-priced and relatively low-cost shipping option. Partners only incurred the cost of shipping, plus the value of any lost or damaged parts. As such, participants gained access to fabrication technologies without having to incur costs for purchase or maintenance. Sample lesson plans were shared along with the technologies; however, user-developed designs and lesson plans were encouraged. In particular, the project encouraged participants to share their creations with the Makers by Mail community by posting them to our blog and/or teaching commons. These user-developed projects and lesson plans helped us better understand the needs of our both our local users — public libraries, educators, and individuals in Iowa — as well as our digital humanities community: educators and scholars committed to interrogating  “ideologies and environments for who gets to make, who can maintain, and who must source ”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Questions about power and belonging are not incompatible with the maker movement. As Emily Chang, Joy Rankin, and Melissa Terras have noted, perceptions about who should make are often limited to those backed by powerful institutions and positionalities <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Matt Ratto and Megan Boler view making as  “an activity that provides both the possibility to intervene substantively in systems of authority and power and that offers an important site for reflecting on how such power is constituted by infrastructures, institutions, communities, and practices”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Makers by Mail challenged notions of power by building a distributed making model with a human-centered approach. Often bound by a specific geography and context, traditional makerspaces can face accessibility issues from a number of vectors, such as cost, location, audience, and material. These factors can make it difficult to live out minimal computing’s ethos of maximum justice, which asks practitioners to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the use of technological, cultural, social, and economic barriers to increase entry, access, participation, and self-representation in computing and</li>
<li>Build systems/projects premised on social justice and difference, not white supremacy and settler colonialism. <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The Makers by Mail project sought to address both issues by 1) providing technology education that is both accessible and affordable for individuals and groups with limited access to other makerspace programs and 2) developing relationships with traditionally marginalized groups. We were moderately successful within our spheres of influence: in 2016, Boyles was involved in local and international digital humanities communities and Petersen was a member of organizations serving public and academic libraries. However, the project&rsquo;s distributed making model conflicted with institutional notions of who should make, increasing the precarity of both the project and its community. Further, these power dynamics inhibited the project’s access to the resources and support needed for growth and sustainability.</p>
<p>Precarity is a frequent issue for makers and makerspaces, as they are often dependent upon limited labor and funding resources. As Boyles et al. note,  “Many digital humanists, as well as their critics, have noted the stratification of labor in the digital humanities and the scarcity of resources available to sustain those various classes of workers and the larger collaborations or centers to which they contribute”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Minimal computing’s relationship to precarity cannot be ignored. In an environment of increasing austerity — both academic and otherwise — minimal methodologies encourage innovation in the face of scarcity. As Alex Gil notes,  “Minimal computing does not stand in as a universal call, but rather as a space for new questions and practices, an injunction to constantly repeat the question, ‘what do we need?’”   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Minimal computing responds to this question by operating, and even excelling, in conditions of precarity. Minimal approaches require minimal resources, reducing barriers to access and inclusion. This philosophy is particularly compelling, as it extends beyond the walls of the university into communities that have traditionally been excluded. The Makers by Mail project was drawn to this methodology, as we believe that our greatest responsibility as scholars is to extend public knowledge and to work for the betterment of society. Minimal methodologies also made it possible for us to succeed in spite of our own precarity, in terms of positionality, resources, and support.</p>
<p>At the same time, we acknowledge that minimal computing cannot address the broader inequities within our institutions and, in fact, may even demonstrate that scholars, researchers, teachers, and practitioners can do more with less. One term for understanding this phenomenon is resilience, or  “the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats or significant sources of stress”   <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. In our ongoing community-engaged scholarship, we, the principal investigators of Makers by Mail, have seen resilience weaponized against vulnerable peoples and groups. In particular, the term resilience was used to downplay government failures in post-Hurricane María Puerto Rico by drawing attention to the incredible recovery work implemented by local grassroots community organizations. As Yarimar Bonilla and Marisol LeBrón note,  “The much-touted resilience of Puerto Ricans thus needs to be itself understood as a form of trauma: years of abandonment by local and federal governments have forced community to take care of themselves”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While the contexts in which resilience is applied vary greatly, rhetorics of resilience have become increasingly popular tools for downplaying precarity, austerity, and vulnerability. Makers by Mail demonstrates the complex relationship between power, precarity, and minimal computing by demonstrating how minimal methodologies alleviated elements of our precarity while simultaneously exacerbating it in others.</p>
<h2 id="project-strengths-or-how-we-operationalized-precarity-with-minimal-methodologies">Project Strengths, or How We Operationalized Precarity with Minimal Methodologies</h2>
<p>Minimal computing made it possible to launch the Makers by Mail project with limited financial and institutional resources. As Alex Gil and Élika Ortega articulate, minimal computing can refer to a variety of activities and approaches, including minimalist hardware,  “eliminating clutter [&hellip;] ease of use, ease of creation, increased access, and reductions in computing”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. In the development of its kits, Makers by Mail followed two distinct approaches to minimal computing.</p>
<p>The first embodies the values of increased access and ease of use. Makers by Mail’s initial offering was a surveillance camera kit using littleBits and a digital camera. Intuitive, modular, and easily constructible, littleBits are a fantastic resource for introductory making, providing an easy access point to understand circuitry. This kit was designed for users seeking to enhance their digital literacy in a fun and accessible way. Since acquiring littleBits can be cost-prohibitive, Makers by Mail provided an affordable method of access by charging users only for the cost of shipping rather than for the technologies, allowing them to experiment with the littleBits on a provisional basis before making a larger time or financial investment.</p>
<p>The second approach emphasizes minimalist hardware, working with communities to build basic servers. Using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and step-by-step instructions, this kit walked participants through the steps of building a locally hosted web server. As this is often a daunting task for individuals, testing out the process of building a server prepared participants to understand their own hardware, host games, securely store information, and more. While this kit asked users to engage in more advanced computing than the littleBits kits, it was designed using minimal computing technology. In essence, the kits’ Raspberry Pis are computers stripped down to include only the most necessary components; however, this approach can make Raspberry Pis more, rather than less, complicated. For example, while Raspberry Pis have enough hardware onboard to allow for a wide array of computing projects, their stripped-down nature requires users to attach peripherals to fully engage with the system. As Gil and Ortega note, minimal computing does not always equal minimum effort  <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. In this case, our community felt that access to a completely private, locally-hosted server was worth the barriers to access.</p>
<p>Our team also turned to minimal computing to address infrastructural issues by returning to the question, What does the project need? We focused on rapid prototyping with technologies owned or borrowed by the collaborators, providing space to experiment and play. We settled on United States Postal Service (USPS) Priority Mail shipping for distributing kits, solving the question of distribution scale. We relied upon existing connections for user testing, garnering feedback from relevant user groups. The precarity necessitating these solutions — our positionality as a graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow — lent its own affordances, given that our supervisors and the institution had few expectations regarding our research topic, project scope, or publication record.</p>
<h2 id="rapid-prototyping">Rapid Prototyping</h2>
<p>At the project’s onset, the project collaborators had a series of connections within various Midwest public libraries, a library graduate program, and the digital humanities community. Leaning on these relationships, our team was able to rapidly prototype kits and develop ideas in a variety of communities. Small focus groups and pop-up events provided venues for participants to give feedback on the clarity of directions, ease of assembly, entertainment factor, and more. This feedback gave us the opportunity to iteratively revise our kits, resulting in improved instructions and kit contents. For example, after some public librarians expressed uncertainty over where they would have patrons hook up Raspberry Pis, we revised the Server Kit to include a miniature touchscreen monitor.</p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p>In the developmental process of Makers by Mail, our project team centered a need for portability and scalability. As we sought to provide accessible and affordable technology education, we wanted our kits to be able to be easily distributable while maintaining transparency and consistency of costs to users. Ultimately, we settled on using USPS Flat Rate shipping boxes for the distribution of our kits. Costing the same for anywhere in the contiguous United States, these boxes were freely available and consistently dimensioned, allowing us to accurately state the cost of shipping any number of kits. Building Makers by Mail with these shipping boxes in mind, we were able to keep participant costs down and choose technologies, packaging, and instructions that could be easily transported, reused, and replicated.</p>
<h2 id="broad-connections">Broad Connections</h2>
<p>An additional strength of the Makers by Mail project was its broad focus on college-aged and adult audiences. Many conventional makerspaces and maker initiatives have been targeted either towards introducing elementary or middle school students to technology or to the heavily tech fluent. While K-8 initiatives serve as an exhilarating way to engage youth with technology, these introductory resources can appear too simple for adult audiences, failing to build an interest in more in-depth maker technologies. Likewise, tools geared towards the tech-fluent — CNC machines, woodworking equipment, 3D printers, or laser cutters — often exclude and intimidate adults first starting out with critical making. For these reasons, our team focused on developing kits aimed at college students and adult audiences. With public library programming garnering interest from broad age ranges and technological fluencies, we focused on developing adaptable kits that could be informative and accessible for beginners while allowing for ample remixing and play. With this unique introductory adult focus, Makers by Mail presented the possibility of broad connections in public libraries, community organizations, college classes, and other academic programs. Partnered with its ease of distribution and scalability, the kits could readily be mailed to a diverse array of users.</p>
<h2 id="project-challenges-or-the-harms-of-precarity">Project Challenges, or the Harms of Precarity</h2>
<p>While the project has many strengths, minimal computing methods could not address the broader issues of precarity within the institution and community. In particular, our positionalities — as a postdoctoral fellow and a graduate student — limited numerous opportunities for project growth and sustainability, including the project team’s ability to build community, acquire funding, and collaborate effectively.</p>
<h2 id="community-building">Community-building</h2>
<p>The Makers by Mail project was designed to foster community-building and collaboration, but we had limited experience developing relationships with organizations outside the academy. Hoping that the project would serve as a springboard for community-building, we launched a publicity campaign, reaching out to local schools and public libraries as well as presenting at conferences including the Iowa Library Association’s (ILA) annual conference, the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) annual conference, and Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE). Doing so generated interest in the project and led to meaningful conversations on best practices for implementing the kits in classrooms and workshops with a handful of collaborators testing the kits at their own institutions.</p>
<p>One of the most important lessons we learned is that relationship-building should always come before project development and implementation so that community organizations can communicate needs, share priorities, and offer feedback on content and direction. Failing to do so results in a misalignment of priorities in which scholars are placing their needs before that of the community. This, in turn, leads to complications or relationship dynamics that reinforce harmful top-down power structures between the institution and the academy.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, the Makers by Mail project conducted focus groups to test out a variety of kit designs; however, our participants were limited to a handful of graduate students and public library patrons. The feedback these groups provided was valuable but lacked the broader representation needed to develop kits that were dynamic, useful, and accessible to our desired audience: marginalized communities throughout North America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Since both principal investigators were on limited term contracts — Petersen was in the last year of his Master’s in Library and Information Science and Boyles was in the first year of a two-year postdoctoral fellow position — there was not enough time to build long, sustained collaborations with community organizations. Perhaps the biggest lesson learned during the launch and deployment of Makers by Mail is that community-building takes time. In fact, we are still actively building relationships with many of the partners we first contacted in 2016, especially those who are collaborating with us on the Archivo de Respuestas Emergencias de Puerto Rico — our current community-engaged digital humanities project.</p>
<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
<p>The Makers by Mail project received a microgrant from the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH), which allowed our team to purchase the technology needed to develop one of the three available kits. It soon became clear, however, that most other sources of funding — both internal and external — were dependent on the project having a tenure-track faculty member listed as principal investigator. With these funding limitations, the project became more reliant on personally owned technology, loaned materials, and tenuous collaborations.</p>
<p>These challenges were most explicitly seen in the development and adaptation of kits, particularly when trying out new technologies. Although our team and focus groups expressed interest in an array of other kits, including basic circuits and wearable computing, we were limited in our ability to purchase and test new technologies and frequently barred from educator discounts or negotiated university pricing. For example, after our team expressed an interest in developing a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) Arduino kit, one collaborator ultimately acquired the necessary supplies by asking for them as a birthday gift.</p>
<p>For the long-term success of this project, Makers by Mail would need a more robust funding structure, both to replace materials and to maintain the currency of the kits. Some of the initial technologies used in our kits proved relatively frail, particularly when repeatedly used or distributed. LittleBits proved particularly susceptible to damage, with replacement components running between five and fifty dollars each. Outside of the core technologies, each kit also necessitated consumables — packing tape for shipping, instruction cards, batteries, and more — which added small costs over time. Alongside the need to replace components, some amount of funding would be needed to update the circulating kits. For example, since we acquired the materials for the Server Kit, multiple new generations of Raspberry Pis have been released. Although the project’s early third generation Raspberry Pis work well, if one breaks, it will become increasingly difficult to find an exact replacement. Likewise, new generations of kit components may feature different computer architecture or functionality with peripherals, requiring revised documentation and more replacement components. In many instances, updated or replacement components are fine; however, others have difficulties interfacing with older parts or require more capital investment to revise the kits.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<p>For a brief period of time, the Makers by Mail project included a third principal investigator — a tenure-track faculty member at the University of Iowa. Initially, this collaboration was successful; the three of us communicated well and complemented one another. Over time, however, the unequal power dynamics among the principal investigators — reinforced by the institution — proved to be highly problematic.</p>
<p>For example, only tenure-track faculty members were eligible for internal grants. This meant that what little internal funding we acquired was under the sole control of the tenure-track faculty member, who opted to use the funds to purchase littleBits against the advice of the other collaborators. This choice was particularly contentious because, as Kim Martin notes in her review of the project,  “[L]ittleBits, while great for sparking curiosity, break quite frequently and require batteries to operate. While the only other consumable in the kits at the moment is duct tape, one can imagine this number growing as the projects expand, and these costs, in addition to replacements for obsolete technology, have to be accounted for as the project grows”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. This choice ultimately hurt the project’s long-term sustainability by ramping up costs that could not be absorbed by the project’s budget.</p>
<p>Additionally, only tenure-track faculty members could be listed as principal investigators for most internal and external awards. This led to issues with credit, as most official documentation, including that disseminated by the institution, gave recognition solely to the tenure-track faculty member. When our faculty collaborator refused to address these inequities, the three of us parted ways. The dissolution of this collaboration was particularly painful, as the tenure-track faculty member claimed rights to all technologies — even those purchased with funding awarded to the three of us. This effectively bound the project to the University of Iowa, making continuation of the project difficult once the two precariously positioned project collaborators had left the institution.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-commons">Teaching Commons</h2>
<p>Alongside the acquisition and distribution of technologies, a crucial element of Makers by Mail has been the development of related teaching materials. To go along with the makers kits, our team intended to include physical copies of instructional materials, a print facilitators guide, and supplemental online resources in a Teaching Commons. These supplemental materials were meant to be a backbone of the Makers by Mail project, allowing groups to experiment with a variety of lessons, target activities to their specific interests, troubleshoot malfunctioning technologies, or even begin developing their own kits. Unfortunately, the Teaching Commons never came to fruition, with only physical copies of instructions provided with the kits. Uncertainty about the project and collaborators’ academic futures paired with regular remixing of kits resulted in the Teaching Commons always being a next step in the process that was never developed. Before this project could ever truly prove broadly successful, reconsideration and development of the Teaching Commons would be a must.</p>
<p>In her review of Makers by Mail, Kimberley Martin points out this necessity, stating,  “Makerspaces, no matter where they are located, are made possible, and even profitable, by the community members that frequent them”   <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. With this consideration of community in mind, were we to revamp the project, our team would likely reconsider where the Teaching Commons is housed. Although having these resources directly on the site is beneficial, Makers by Mail would likely reach a broader audience if the instructional materials were also housed in a collaborative network like Humanities Commons or HASTAC. Inclusion on these sites would tap into a network of like-minded scholars and help establish connections within the academic community; however, this transition alone would not break down the cultural and technological barriers Makers by Mail seeks to address.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This article has examined notions of power and precarity within the Makers by Mail project to interrogate the relationship between minimal computing methodologies and academic contingency. Doing so pushes us to reconsider the question What do we need? to center not only technological tangibles but also human(e) requirements for effective and ethical engagement.</p>
<p>While this piece focuses on Makers by Mail, we hope our experience can bring attention to the ways in which precarity operates and is operationalized by individuals and institutions to reinforce traditional notions of power and limit opportunities for marginalized peoples and groups. We hope that our experiences offer insight into the lives of precarious digital humanists, and that they continue pushing our field to reconsider when and how we support digital scholars and their projects.</p>
<p>There are many ways to push against precarity in digital humanities: providing better contracts, paying higher wages, offering funding opportunities, developing mentorship networks, giving appropriate credit, supporting career growth, and promoting structural change. Any of the above would have helped shift our work away from precarity and toward praxis — working with and supporting communities.</p>
<p>While minimal computing methodologies can help us alleviate some of the structural inequalities within higher education, we cannot achieve maximum justice until we address the problem of precarity within our own institutions.</p>

<p>Like any technologists, practitioners embracing minimal computing principles must grapple with the changing purposes, audiences, scales, and functionalities of the project they are supporting. In this case study, we explore the challenges of maintaining a sustainable static-site architecture during the multilingual expansion of  <em>The Programming Historian (PH)</em> , an open-access publication of peer-reviewed tutorials on digital tools and workflows geared at humanities teachers and researchers. By elucidating the deep intertwining of the technical, logistical, and social challenges of moving from a monolingual to a multilingual publication, we hope to provide other digital project teams with a valuable perspective on the tradeoffs of static sites when the projects they support are rapidly growing in size and complexity.</p>
<p><em>PH</em>  started in 2008 as a series of open access tutorials on Python created by William J. Turkel and Alan MacEachern. The lessons were hosted by the Network in Canadian History &amp; Environment (NiCHE) on a WordPress site <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. In 2012, the project expanded its editorial team and became an open-access, peer-reviewed scholarly journal of methodology for digital historians. In 2014,  <em>PH</em>  migrated away from WordPress in favor of a Jekyll-based static site hosted on GitHub Pages <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The project team made this decision based on the benefits promised by many static-site generators: fewer worries about security upgrades and hosting expenses; precise customizability for our editorial workflow; and preservable, version-controlled, plain text files for all of our peer-reviewed lessons. Since this migration, we have never:</p>
<p>Run out of memory, processing power, or bandwidth;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>     Worried about SQL injection or external hacking;  Lost data from accidental deletion or hardware failure; or  Been bound by the built-in data models provided by a platform such as Open Journal Systems or Janeway.</p>
<p>At the time, with only one team of editors managing a single publication workflow, this minimalistic approach seemed an excellent solution for both technical flexibility as well as sustainability.</p>
<p>But  <em>PH</em>  has grown radically since then. Prompted by a discussion about the use of  _PH _ in Colombia and Mexico and ad-hoc translations into Spanish, the  <em>PH</em>  editorial team decided to extend the journal to a second language <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. In late 2016, a group of three editors began work on  <em>PH en español</em> , launching the site in March 2017. A year and a half later, a group of French-speaking editors did the same, launching  <em>PH en français</em>  in April 2019. A Portuguese editorial team launched  <em>PH em português</em>  in January 2021.</p>
<p>Throughout the process of onboarding new editors from multiple backgrounds and publishing lessons in several languages, both originals and translations, the team came to discuss ways to better reach our global audience and enhance language accessibility.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  These goals have relied on the malleable Jekyll-based site to create a more accessible journal, but have also tested the limits of both the technology as well as our team’s processes. We frame this work as an example of critical making, defined by Matt Ratto as  “connect[ing] two modes of engagement with the world that are often held separate — critical thinking, typically understood as conceptually and linguistically based, and physical ‘making,’ goal-based material work”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. For _ PH_ , creating and maintaining a multilingual publication is an act of critical making, negotiating the complexities of language and the constraints of our infrastructure in both technology and labor. A simple question on additional metadata, a request for search capability, or a light-bulb moment when someone asks, How are we going to note if someone translates a translated lesson? requires sociotechnical expertise in different levels of our publishing workflows and technical infrastructure from a team of volunteer humanists.</p>
<p>In our desire to democratize access to knowledge, we constantly encounter situations where easing the complexity of one workflow requires increasing the complexity of another, in turn relocating complexity (and the labor it entails) to different members of our project team.</p>
<h2 id="language-expansion">Language Expansion</h2>
<p>Nowhere is the shifting of complexity between team members more obvious (or problematic) than when the project expands by adding a publication in a new language. Linguistic expansion is part and parcel of  <em>PH</em> ’s core mission of opening access to learning across geographic and cultural boundaries <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. However, new language teams face multiple challenges, both before and after they start publishing content. Here, we focus on the experiences of the French team, which was formed in early 2018. The Portuguese team, which was onboarded as we wrote this article, is likely to face similar issues, perhaps made more acute by the expansion of the project’s infrastructure over the past three years. Any additional teams joining the project in the future will meet similar obstacles.</p>
<p>The first hurdle, which must be cleared before any publication in a new language can occur, consists of translating the project’s interface, documentation, and accumulated wisdom. This requires that the new language team assimilate this knowledge, along with the technical know-how necessary to navigate the  <em>PH</em> ’s underlying technology. In the case of the French team, this process took the better part of a year. If, as Alex Gil wrote, one of the precepts of minimal computing is to restrict ourselves to  “what we need,”  what new  <em>PH</em>  language teams need has proven considerable indeed <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Of course, some of the work, such as the translation of menus and author guidelines, would have been necessary regardless of the publishing platform. However, much of the rest — including self-training on the somewhat arcane procedures (e.g., how to write markdown, how to commit a change in GitHub, how to format metadata) — that must be followed to publish lessons, as well as translating these procedures into the new publication’s language for the benefit of future editors, is considerably more involved than it would be if the project used a standard Content Management System (CMS). Whereas most CMS software is built upon user interface concepts that have long been internalized, our procedure requires a fairly steep learning curve that often must be climbed several times before the procedure becomes comfortable. Some of the complexity of a CMS has thus been offloaded onto editors.</p>
<p>Language expansion also has subtle implications for project maintenance <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. When content needs to be added or modified, either in the site’s common infrastructure or in a lesson that has been published in more than one language, two options are available: publish the update in all languages at the same time or update each language-specific site as new content becomes available. In the first case, the language team with the least available bandwidth constrains the speed of the update. In the second case, the project’s content becomes desynchronized, and a backlog of tasks accumulates for one or more of the language teams. Either way, smaller teams experience asymmetrically heavier pressure. Since its inception, the French team has rarely had more than two fully active members at the same time; the pressures of day-to-day maintenance thus fall on few people, which in turn slows down the production of new content. One consequence is that some translations have been held up for several months, for lack of an available editor to manage peer review. As the project expands to more languages, pressure will increase on these smaller teams to keep pace, and may disrupt the smooth running of the project.</p>
<p>A further source of complexity resides in the dual pipelines required to publish translated and original lessons in each language. For example, recruiting peer reviewers to examine translations of tutorials into French has proven challenging because, while the work is relatively straightforward, there are no clear norms within academia to reward it. (Where does one even list peer-reviewing a translation on their CV?) Thus, the French team’s editors have had to perform more of this work than perhaps would be wise, further depleting the amount of bandwidth available for other tasks.</p>
<p>Finally, while language expansion provides  <em>PH</em>  with opportunities to further the cause of global outreach and help multiple digital humanities traditions cross-pollinate, it also increases labor complexity for the editors.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  Our hope is that authors will eventually produce original content in their own languages for all of our publications. To further this cross-pollination, however, we will also need to recruit translators able to adapt source material written in multiple languages and reviewers able to assess this work. It seems inevitable that, as we advance in this direction, we will push against the limits of what is adaptable, which will lead our publications to diverge. Finding the right balance will present interesting challenges.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="code-complexity-vs-workflow-complexity">Code Complexity vs. Workflow Complexity</h2>
<p>It should be clear by now that  <em>PH</em>  has an involved publication workflow. From our experience running such an intricate publication via Jekyll, we would argue that static sites cannot eliminate complexity from already-complex publications; they can only relocate it.</p>
<p>The database systems behind conventional content management systems (CMS) such as Wordpress or Drupal do more than store and serve data. They enforce crucial logical constraints such as type checking ( <em>Is this date valid? Is this field an integer rather than a text value?</em> ); uniqueness ( <em>Does another page already have this URL? Does a tag with this title already exist?</em> ); and foreign key relationships ( <em>This article is written by two different authors — do they both have corresponding entries in the  “authors”  table?</em> ). In the case of multilingual sites, some CMSs don’t provide these options and, when they do, their functions are not necessarily straightforward or accessible. For example, one can only track progress of a translation if using the paid for WordPress Multilingual Plugin. With Drupal, the interface has to be translated manually on individual pages. And other options, such as .NET, require the user to be comfortable editing HTML and XML to work with RESX or resource files.</p>
<p>Static site generator systems such as Jekyll offer a pared-down version of data manipulation. For every article in  <em>PH</em> , some data reside in the lesson file (the title; the abstract; the date of publication; the original review ticket URL; the names of the authors, editors, reviewers, and translators; content tags; and a reference key from translated lessons to the original lesson) while other data (author biographies) sit elsewhere. Without the querying features or the constraints supplied by an active database, the onus of maintaining metadata consistency in a straightforward static site falls to its editors.</p>
<p>At  <em>PH</em>  we sought technological opportunities to transfer some of this burden away from our editorial team and onto our codebase instead. Our technical team has poured labor into creating metadata validation systems that would have otherwise come built-in with a database-backed CMS. As our team, metadata richness, and pace of publication expanded, metadata errors increased in frequency. And with a larger team, it was less likely that any given editor would be completely familiar with how the data they entered was used by the site, making it more likely that multiple editors would need to be pulled into a troubleshooting conversation.</p>
<p>To ameliorate this, in May 2017 we wrote the first version of an internal plugin where we could define the kinds of data validation that a normal database would have provided, such as validating required fields, dates, and foreign key relationships. Anyone building the site on their own computer will now see informative error messages describing which fields are missing or which names can’t be found in the data file. With this plugin, we also implemented dead link checking to review all our pages for internal and external links that no longer resolve, alerting our editors to update them or to replace them with links from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine if available <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Yet running this plugin means the editor needs to be able to build the Jekyll site on their own computer. This is a requirement we gave up on long ago, relying on most editors to use GitHub’s code editing interface and using GitHub Pages to actually build and deploy the site. To run this validation, we configured an external continuous integration service: a separate server that would test metadata validity every time an editor proposed a new change to the site and report back any errors in a relatively human-readable format to our editorial workflow system in GitHub’s pull requests. As a result, our minimal publication was no longer all that minimal.</p>
<p>At each step of this process, we opted for increasing the amount of underlying complexity in the site template code, processing code, and in the number of back-end deployment steps. We did this to reduce the cognitive load on and demand for technical competencies from our editors. They now do not need to memorize all required data fields and do not need to be able to run Jekyll themselves but can just read the reports from our cloud-based testing system.</p>
<p>We have repeated this complexity relocation several times, particularly in automating the cross-linking of different pages of the same language as much as possible. Adding hard links between all translations of every single page or lesson would require constant vigilance as pages are updated and new translations published. Additionally, the number of links would grow exponentially as we bring on new language teams. To avoid asking editors to do this grueling work, we instead relied on the affordances of Jekyll and its templating language, Liquid, to construct virtually all the links between our lesson translations.</p>
<p>While this relocation saves a large amount of editor time, it significantly increases the complexity of our site’s source code <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. And any increase in our code complexity means a concomitant increase, however slight, in the cognitive load and work of the technical team in charge of maintaining and extending  <em>PH</em> ’s online platform. This new code was complex enough to require its own dedicated tutorial page. And even with that documentation, changes to the way we render translation links is a delicate job indeed, requiring skilled oversight from our technical editors.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Every choice to displace the labor away from our lesson editors onto our code base thus displaces further cognitive load onto our technical team in charge of maintaining every part of  <em>PH</em> ’s technical infrastructure. This raises serious questions about sustaining the ongoing labor of the project. It forces us to more carefully consider every new feature request that comes from our larger team, weighing the potential advantages against the time and difficulty needed to implement it. As our publications continue to expand, we have an opportunity to refocus the energy of our entire project team onto the essentials of our publications, concentrating on managing the inevitable but critical logistical complexity of multilingual translation, while forgoing new technical features that would merely be nice to have.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Knowing what we know now, would the  <em>PH</em>  project team still choose to publish using a static site architecture? For all the challenges that we have laid out in this case study, we don’t intend to warn against static sites altogether. Free from the task of monitoring the basics of a database-backed site, our technical team has instead been able to spend time on customizing our lessons’ display and metadata to fit our exact needs and building out services such as publication metadata registration and DOIs, all while ensuring our publication record is carefully tracked and preserved in plain text. These benefits are real. But we do want to draw attention to the careful (and not-so-careful) choices we have made about how to distribute the labor of editing and maintaining our publication.</p>
<p>In response to the stress of increasing sociotechnical complexity, the  <em>PH</em>  project team has pursued social changes to ensure that the labor required by this complexity is understood by the entire team. Among these changes have been formalizing sub-teams of the  <em>PH</em>  to more clearly delineate roles and responsibilities; articulating a workflow and communication plan for managing bug fixes and new feature requests so that the technical experts on the project team are able to communicate their workload and reasons for pursuing (or not) suggested changes; and establishing team roles specifically for onboarding new editors and new language teams to help address the barriers to joining a new publication.</p>
<p>There are no simple social or technical solutions for publications as complex as  <em>PH</em> , and the choice of a static architecture still presents tradeoffs with real consequences for the sustainability of any project. We hope this case study highlights the nature of those choices, and helps other digital publication teams consider where (and on whom) the burden of managing complexity falls in their own projects.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<p>Text mining is no longer an uncommon research method when it comes to analyzing texts in the digital humanities. Once limited to the research field, text mining now influences  “our lives, our teaching, and our scholarship, and digital humanists”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> as  “a logocentric practice.”   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, shares common features with text mining when parsing, detecting, and locating words or sentences. Sentiment analysis is  “the process of extracting an author’s emotional intent from text.”   <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Sentiment analysis has historically focused on product reviews, such as those of movies, hotels, cars, books, and restaurants, in addition to blog data, but current sentiment analysis has expanded to  “stock markets, news articles, [and] political debates,”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and serves a variety of purposes. There have been attempts at employing sentiment analysis in literature, mainly grounded on lexicon-based approaches, but sentiment analysis in literature has been a target of attack in digital humanities due to its limits as a research method: Swafford’s critique of the Syuzhet package made a great impact on the digital humanities field by alerting readers to the danger of choosing faulty tools, although her criticism rehashed already existing issues in sentiment analysis. Along with Swafford’s critique of Syuzhet, other digital humanists shared erroneous results found through Syuzhet and expressed uneasy feelings about sentiment analysis in literature. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  In reality, perfect codes/tools cannot exist, so we need to  “embrace  problems ”  with Syuzhet  “as a feature rather than a flaw”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Ted Underwood asserts that if we  “use algorithms in our research,”  we should  “find out how they work.”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Similarly, when using digital tools, it is important to understand their functions, algorithms, and programming syntax, instead of simply drawing upon the visualized results, in order to avoid creating faulty results.</p>
<p>Sentiment analysis is a subfield of natural language processing, which classifies the sentiments of texts. Sentiment analysis researchers traditionally used lexicon-based and machine learning approaches. The machine learning approach uses machine learning algorithms with training datasets to classify sentiments based on linguistic features, whereas the lexicon-based approach draws upon the collection of precompiled sentiment lexicons to label words with sentiment scores. However, these traditional approaches revealed the limits of dealing with complex syntaxes and semantics. Recently, sentiment analysis researchers have proposed deep learning approaches such as transformers, cognition attention-based models, and sentiment-speciﬁc word embedding models. Deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis have been considered  “as eﬃcient methods due to their capability of learning the text without manual feature engineering”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Traditional sentiment analysis approaches mainly drawing upon lexicons have around 70% accuracy, while recent deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis create state-of-the-art results. Sentiment analysis for literary texts, however, is still based on traditional approaches: Kim and Klinger note that  “[i]t is true that much digital humanities research (especially dealing with text) uses the methods of text analysis that were in fashion in computational linguistic twenty years ago.”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Although sentiment analysis has been commonly employed in a variety of fields, mainly for commercial purposes, in addition to testing sentiment analysis with literary texts, sentiment analysis for literature in the digital humanities is relatively new and received little attention until the Syuzhet package was first released, aimed at providing a proper tool for literary analysis. Syuzhet 0.2.0 was released on February 22, 2015 and was soon critiqued by Swafford, who pointed out problems with Syuzhet on her personal blog on March 2, 2015, such as (1) splitting sentences, (2) negators, (3) parts of speech, such as well and like, (4) lexicons being based on contemporary English words, (5) counting a word once for a sentence even if it is repeated, (6) scoring subjectivity, (7) satire and sarcasm, (8) foundation shapes <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Despite the effort by Jockers’ lab to create a useful tool for sentiment analysis tailored to analyzing literary texts, the limits of Syuzhet that Swafford pointed out caused digital humanists to have qualms about sentiment analysis in literature. After Swafford’s criticism against Syuzhet 0.2.0, Syuzhet 1.0.0 was released on April 28, 2016, followed by another release on December 14, 2017 of the 1.0.4 version. After almost three years since 1.0.4, Syuzhet 1.0.6 was released with minor updates on November 24. 2020.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>

</figure>
<p>Figure 1 reveals that Syuzhet has been continuously downloaded as the most popular package for sentiment analysis in R.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  In 2021, it has been downloaded more than 20,000 times monthly, but due to its limits, Syuzhet still remains difficult to validate as a research tool for sentiment analysis in the humanities. In the past, sentiment analysis researchers tested sentiment analysis with literary texts: Saif Mohammad <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> created and tested the NRC lexicon with literary texts such as Shakespeare’s  <em>Hamlet</em>  and  <em>As You Like It</em> , based on the basic emotion models of Ekman and Plutchik. Reagan et al. suggested the  “six core emotional arcs”  (rise, fall, fall-rise, rise-fall, rise-fall-rise, and fall-rise-fall) for fictional stories <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Haider et al. <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> performed sentiment analysis with poems in English and German, using word embeddings as features and manually multi-labeling sentiments. Evgeny Kim and Roman Klinger <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> provided a survey of sentiment analysis in computational literary studies and examined the difficulties of detecting sentiments due to indirectly expressed emotions in literary texts. Michelangelo Misuraca et al. validated Syuzhet, using confusion matrices and macro-averaging with the course_evaluation dataset, of which each sentiment was manually labeled by Charles Welch and Rada Mihalcea <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. In their test, the overall accuracy of Syuzhet was 0.671, and with the education dataset, the averages for precision, recall, and F-measure were 0.605, 0.526, and 0.526, respectively <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Jockers asserts that  “current benchmark studies suggest that [sentiment detection] accuracy”  is  “in the 70-80% range and that depends on genre”   <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, but the accuracy of sentiment detection in the validation test of Syuzhet by Misuraca et al. was 67.1% <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>, which is a little lower than the 70-80% range Jockers argued to defend Syuzhet.</p>
<p>Despite the low accuracy of Syuzhet, it is one of the most popular sentiment analysis tools for R, as Figure 1 shows. After the criticism against Syuzhet, it was difficult to find new sentiment analysis research in the digital humanities, although Syuzhet users have drastically increased in the meantime. The problem is that sentiment analysis tools in R heavily draw upon lexicons, which are far from deep learning approaches in regards to methodology. Recently, despite the criticism against Syuzhet, which resulted in digital humanists having reservations towards sentiment analysis as a research method in the humanities, there were a couple of digital humanists who presented at the ACH2021 conference about sentiment analysis in the humanities using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for sentiment analysis with humanities data. VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool tailored to the sentiment analysis of social media. As Stéfan Sinclair, Stan Ruecker, and Milena Radzikowska emphasize, cultivating a sufficient understanding of digital tools is important since  “the interpretive work is being guided and biased by the data and software”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. While Syuzhet has been controversial as a research method due to its limits, it is still meaningful for helping literary critics grasp what they should consider when performing sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to closely examine Syuzhet 1.0.6 to impart the limits and progress of Syuzhet, with the subjects of my experiment being mainly from 19th century British novels, since they are not under copyright, are long enough to produce valid analyses, and are credited for their well-structured plots. I begin by exploring similar and dissimilar results of sentiment plots, the similarity of deciding positivity and negativity between the lexicons, and the percentage of shared words between lexicons with four lexicons for sentiment analysis: Syuzhet, Bing, Afinn, and NRC. As there are currently no validation datasets for the sentiment analysis of Victorian fiction, I examine the results of sentiment analysis with Charles Dickens’s  <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> , George Eliot’s  <em>Middlemarch</em> , and Charlotte Brontë’s  <em>Jane Eyre</em> . I conclude that Syuzhet needs to be improved in order to capture semantic and syntactic information, that the usage of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation) for sentiment analysis plots creates distorted results. Finally, I suggest that we should use deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis in the humanities.</p>
<h2 id="2-lexicons">2. Lexicons</h2>
<p>The term Syuzhet stems from  “the Russian Formalists Victor Shklovsky and Vladimir Propp who divided narrative into two components, the  fabula  and the  syuzhet ”  to depict narrative structures of story. Syuzhet intends to provide  “the latent structure of narrative by means of sentiment analysis”  and specifically  “the emotional shifts that serve as proxies for the narrative movement between conflict and conflict resolution.”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Jockers’ explanation of Syuzhet describes it as a sentiment analysis tool for the analysis of literary texts. Syuzhet is a lexicon-based package, mainly drawing upon four standard lexicons: Syuzhet, Bing, Afinn, and NRC.<br>
Number of Sentiment Words in Lexicons Used in the Syuzhet Package      Syuzhet  Bing  Afinn  NRC      No. of Positive Words  3587  2006  878  2312      No. of Negative Words  7161  4783  1598  3324      No. of Other Words  -  -  1  8265      Total  10748  6789  2477  13901   <br>
The Bing, Afinn, and Syuzhet lexicons provide polarity which sorts words into positive or negative positions with numeric values. The Bing lexicon<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  has a binary categorization, which simply has two values of –1 and 1. The Afinn lexicon <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  grades words between –5 and 5. The Syuzhet lexicon has more specific values for each sentiment word, ranging between –1 and 1, which are –1.0, –0.8 –0.75, –0.6, –0.5, –0.4, –0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 0.8, 1.0. The NRC lexicon<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  sorts sentiment words into categories consisting of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. The other words from the NRC lexicon in Table 1 consist of anger (1247), anticipation (839), disgust (1058), fear (1476), joy (689), sadness (1191), surprise (534), and trust (1231). A number of words from the NRC lexicon are included in different categories at the same time, but the Syuzhet package can only work with positive and negative lexicons from the NRC lexicon. Excluding duplicate words in the different feeling categories of the NRC lexicon, there are 6,468 unique words. Among these, there are 81 words which belong to both positive and negative categories, such as boisterous,  endless, and revolution. The Syuzhet package processes those 81 words with a score of 0. In addition, if a word was not categorized as positive or negative, it will score 0. For example, confront falls into two categories: anger and anticipation, but scores 0, whereas annoy scores –1, which is categorized as negative, anger, and disgust in the NRC lexicons.</p>

        <p>Figure 3: Differing results from four different lexicons
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 3, however, reveals inconsistent emotional valences from four lexicons for eight novels: Charles Dickens’s  <em>Our Mutual Friend</em>  and  <em>Bleak House</em> , Wilkie Collins’  <em>The Woman in White</em> , Jane Austen’s  <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> , Emily Brontë’s  <em>Wuthering Heights</em> , Charlotte Brontë’s  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  and  <em>Villette</em> , and James Joyce’s  <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em> .</p>
<p>What causes different sentiment analysis results to be generated depending on the lexicon? I examined the differences between the four lexicons based on positivity and negativity in order to find the reasons why sentiment trajectories could be different between them. Table 2 reveals that the Bing and Afinn lexicons have the highest similarity of deciding positivity and negativity, whereas the Syuzhet and NRC lexicons have the lowest number between the results, although the number is still high.<br>
Similarity of deciding positivity and negativity between lexicons used in the Syuzhet package     Lexicons (No. of Words)   Syuzhet-Bing (5,910)  Syuzhet-Afinn (2,285)  Syuzhet-NRC (4,783)  Bing-Afinn (1,315)  Bing-NRC (2,396)  Afinn-NRC (990)      Similarity of Deciding Positivity and Negativity  98.26%  98.47%  96.59%  98.71%  98.33%  98.18%   <br>
The percent similarity for giving the same words positive or negative values between two different lexicons are the followings: Syuzhet-Bing (98.26%, 5,910 words), Syuzhet-Afinn (98.47%, 2,285 words), Syuzhet-NRC (96.59%, 4,783 words), Bing-Afinn (98.71%, 1,315 words), Bing-NRC (98.33%, 2,396 words), and Afinn-NRC (98.18%, 990 words). This means that the Syuzhet and Bing lexicons have 5,910 common words that, when given positive and negative scores, conflict 1.74% of the time. For example, the words avenge,  enough, and envy are scored 0.25, –0.25, and –0.8 by the Syuzhet lexicon, versus –1, 1, and 1 by the Bing lexicon. Looking into the comparison of the Syuzhet and NRC lexicons, the words absolute,  ancient, and blush score –0.25, 0.25, and 0.6 in the Syuzhet lexicon, versus 1, –1, and –1 in the NRC lexicon, respectively. These different decisions whether words will be assigned positive or negative can bring about different results during sentiment analysis, as shown in figure 3.<br>
Percentage of shared words between lexicons used in the Syuzhet package    Lexicons (No. of Words)  Syuzhet-Bing (5,910)  Syuzhet-Afinn (2,285)  Syuzhet-NRC (4,783)  Bing-Afinn (1,315)  Bing-NRC (2,396)  Afinn-NRC (990)      Syuzhet  54.99%  21.26%  44.50%  -  -  -      Bing  87.05%  -  -  19.37%  35.29%  -      Afinn  -  92.25%  -  53.09%  -  39.97%      NRC  -  -  73.95%  -  37.04%  15.31%   <br>
Based on table 3, the percentage of words included in the Syuzhet package that are shared with any given lexicon are relatively low across the board. This is most likely due to the fact that the Syuzhet lexicon was created much later with reference to the Bing, Afinn, and NRC lexicons, and therefore includes words from all three. Because of this, Syuzhet has the most words of any lexicon (not including repeated words in the NRC lexicon) at 10,748 words, causing the disproportion between the percentages of shared words for Syuzhet and the lexicons it is being compared with. Similarly, Afinn, with the fewest words of the four lexicons, when compared with them generates higher percentages for itself.</p>
<p>Despite having the same tool setting conditions, depending on the lexicon, sentiment trajectories could be different due to the subjectivity of the lexicons. The inconsistent sentiment scores of the Syuzhet lexicon result in the discrediting of lexicon-based sentiment analysis. Stephen Ramsay states that literary criticism is not only  “a qualitative matter”  but also  “an insistently subject manner of engagement.”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> Likewise, creating lexicons is a  “subject manner of engagement”   <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> through the subjective interpretation of emotions used in labeling words with scores. Sentiment analysis packages provide customizing functions, either through the customization of dictionaries or the use of dictionaries that are created from scratch, in order to overcome this limit. Nonetheless, it would be challenging to create a dictionary that avoids every critique of subjectivity.</p>
<p>Syuzhet 1.0.6 has not provided a function to use custom dictionaries yet. Syuzhet 2.0.0 is expected to provide the function, but it usually requires a considerable amount of time and effort to create sentiment dictionaries, and customized dictionaries might face the question of reliability and credibility when used in research. Instead of creating a sentiment dictionary from scratch, researchers can use pre-made sentiment dictionaries, such as the psychological Harvard-IV dictionary <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  (DictionaryGI), or customize their sentiment analysis by adding algorithms, but they cannot change the sentiment scores from existing lexicons.</p>
<h2 id="3-syuzhet">3. Syuzhet</h2>
<h2 id="31-parsing">3.1 Parsing</h2>
<p>The goal of opinion mining is to generate relevant information from texts for analysis. To do so, parsing text is the first step. However, there can be distortions in the process of text mining if raw data are not trimmed. Therefore, well-structured text data need to be inputted for sentiment analysis to generate the correct data. In Syuzhet, there are two different ways to parse text and transform it into vector values: (1) Tokenizing the text into sentences, and then transforming the text into a numeric vector for each sentence. (2) Tokenizing the text into words, and then transforming each word into vector representations. Depending on the purpose of research, the text is tokenized into sentences or words through either the get_sentences function or the get_tokens function. For the sentiment analysis of novels, the first method, which tokenizes the text into sentences, is normally chosen, so I will focus on parsing the text into sentences using the Syuzhet package. The Syuzhet package originally (versions 1.0.1 and earlier) called upon the OpenNLP <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  API, which is an open source, in order to implement the get_sentences and the get_tokens functions. In addition, the Syuzhet package originally required installing Oracle’s Java and two R packages, namely openNLPdata and rJava, in order to use the OpenNLP parser, which was not user-friendly. Both the get_sentences function and the get_tokens function parse sentences or tokenize words into numeric vectors of sentiment values. Parsing text is a basic query used to process natural languages, as computers cannot read characters, only numbers. Swafford points out the problems with the OpenNLP parser when grouping sentences <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, and Jockers responds to her by asserting that the OpenNLP parser and the Stanford CoreNLP parser are  “good enough”   <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>, although he admits that these parsers have problems. In fact, the Stanford parser <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  is a well-constructed tool, which applies a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. The OpenNLP parser has been improved, but I found that Syuzhet no longer uses the OpenNLP parser for the get_sentences function, despite Jockers mentioning that it does <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. Instead, Syuzhet draws upon the Textshape package developed by Tyler Rinker for parsing sentences. It seems the Syuzhet manual has not been updated yet, as this change in the parser by Jockers went undocumented. It is possible that Jockers made the change in order to acknowledge the limits of the OpenNLP parser for literary text. Syuzhet 1.0.2 was updated with the removal of the Java dependency, which means that Syuzhet users do not have to install Oracle’s Java and its dependent packages, openNLPdata and rJava, anymore to utilize the Textshape package, in addition to parallelization of the get_sentiment function by Philip Bulsink on July 28, 2017.<br>

In table 4, I compared the parsing results from sixteen novels using Syuzhet 0.2.0 with the OpenNLP parser and Syuzhet 1.0.6 with the Textshape parser in order to examine the improvements of the parsing function in Syuzhet. Table 4 reveals the fact that the parsing function of Syuzhet was improved across the board after Syuzhet deployed the Textshape package for parsing instead of the OpenNLP parser. The parsing results from the sixteen novels between Syuzhet 0.2.0 and 1.0.6 have a 13.75% increase. For example, table 5, which shows the parsing result from Charles Dickens’s  <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> , informs that the parsing function of Syuzhet 1.0.2 was improved by splitting sentences more correctly. The OpenNLP parser often failed to split sentences such as:  “ I’ll take the rest of the spell.    No, no, father! ”   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> In addition, the OpenNLP parser did not split sentences which ended with exclamation and quotation marks. For example, table 5, which is the parsing result from George Eliot’s  <em>Middlemarch</em> , is one of examples that proves that the OpenNLP does not process an exclamation mark as a splitter. In other words, the Textshape package parsed the text into sentences more correctly than the OpenNLP parser based on tables 4, 5 and 6.<br>
Parsing from George Eliot’s  <em>Middlemarch</em>  (Chapter 1)    Syuzhet ≤ 1.0.1  Syuzhet ≥ 1.0.2      Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul? Celia was not without a touch of naive malice.  Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul?      Celia was not without a touch of naive malice.        Parsing from Charles Dickens’s  <em>Our Mutual Friend</em>  (Book 1, Chapter 1)     Syuzhet ≤ 1.0.1  Syuzhet ≥ 1.0.2      ‘Here! and give me hold of the sculls.  ‘Here!      and give me hold of the sculls.      I’ll take the rest of the spell.’ ‘No, no, father!  I’ll take the rest of the spell.’      ‘No, no, father!      No! I can’t indeed.  No!      I can’t indeed.   <br>
Lastly, I tested the parsing function of Syuzhet with Charles Dickens’s  <em>Bleak House</em>  to compare the part of chapter 3 where Swafford pointed out grouping errors (see table 6).<br>
Parsing from Charles Dickens’s  <em>Bleak House</em>  (Book 1, Chapter 3)     Syuzhet ≤ 1.0.1  Syuzhet ≥ 1.0.2        Mrs. Rachael, I needn’t inform you who were acquainted with the late Miss Barbary’s affairs, that her means die with her and that this young lady, now her aunt is dead —   My aunt, sir!  It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to be gained by it, said Mr. Kenge smoothly, Aunt in fact, though not in law.      Mrs. Rachael, I needn’t inform you who were acquainted with the late Miss Barbary’s affairs, that her means die with her and that this young lady, now her aunt is dead —   My aunt, sir!        It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to be gained by it, said Mr. Kenge smoothly, Aunt in fact, though not in law.   <br>
Based on the parsing result in table 7, the Textshape parser split sentences after an exclamation mark, but not a dash. Syuzhet 1.0.6 with the Textshape parser sorts sentences better than Syuzhet 1.0.1 with the OpenNLP parser. The Textshape parser, however, still has room for improvement for splitting sentences. For example, the Textshape parser infrequently fails to split sentences based on a period, such as:  “ My dear, I don’t know it,  said I.  You do,  she said very shortly.”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> in addition to the dash. Based on the parsed result of sixteen novels, I concluded that the Textshape package basically separates sentences based on a period, exclamation mark, or question mark.</p>
<h2 id="32-comparison-of-sentiment-values">3.2 Comparison of Sentiment Values</h2>
<p>Syuzhet allocates different numeric vectors to each word/sentence based on the lexicon chosen. These transitioned numeric vectors are turned into structured data or visualization for further analysis. In Syuzhet, there are four different functions to show the emotional valence of stories throughout narrative time: get_sentiment, get_percentage_values, get_transformed_values, and get_dct_transform. The get_percentage_values, get_transformed_values and get_dct_transform functions are percentage-based functions, whereas the get_sentiment function is based on the number of sentences. The get_sentiment function transforms texts into accumulative numeric values for sentiment analysis by matching each word with sentiment scores in selected lexicons. The get_percentage_values function  “divides a text into an equal number of  chunks  and then calculates the mean sentiment valence for each.” <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> The get_transformed_values function uses the Fourier with a low pass filter to make the graph smooth, but Jockers recommends get_dct_transform in lieu of get_transformed_values because get_transformed_values is only being maintained for legacy purposes. The get_dct_tansform function draws upon  “the simpler discrete cosine transformation (DCT),”  and its strength is to depict  “edge values in the smoothed version of the sentiment vector”   <sup id="fnref2:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. DCT is mostly used in digital media to efficiently process calculations and compress digital media, but it can create errors between data blocks. The fundamental idea of DCT is to compress data for efficiency by removing noise, but in doing so, DCT can distort the original data when performing sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>I tested Syuzhet (1.0.6), SentimentAnalysis (1.3-4), sentimentr (2.7.1), RSentiment (2.2.2), and VADER (R, 0.2.1) with seven different sentences to see how each lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool generates sentiment scores (see table 8). SentimentAnalysis utilizes lexicons such as QDAP (Quantitative Discourse Analysis Package) dictionary, GI (Havard-IV) dictionary, and LM (Loughran-McDonald) dictionary. sentimentr by default uses the combination of an augmentation version of the Syuzhet and Bing lexicons. Similarly, RSentiment uses the Bing lexicon, whereas VADER deploys its own lexicon.<br>

The sentiment scores of each sentence created with Syuzhet are positive, aside from C. I tested B by replacing not with never, and I got the same result with Syuzhet. Furthermore, C produced –0.5 points, and D generated 0.25 points. The word, sad was given –0.5 points. D scored 0.25 points due to the combination of sad (–0.5) and happy (0.75). This result indicates that Syuzhet still has issues when semantically detecting sentences, as Swafford has pointed out in the Syuzhet 0.2.0 version. The comparison between A and B shows that Syuzhet has no function to detect negators. D and F depict the lack of a detector for adversative conjunctions in Syuzhet. In addition, the fact that the sentiment score of A is the same with that of G reveals that Syuzhet does not properly detect amplifiers. Table 8 demonstrates how Syuzhet simply reports accumulative sentiment scores based on the words in each sentence, as does SentimentAnalysis, while VADER and sentimentr employ detectors for negators, adversative conjunctions, and amplifiers.</p>
<p>VADER and sentimentr provide functions for detecting negators (not, aren’t, no), amplifiers (really, absolutely, very), de-amplifiers (hardly, barely, rarely), and adversative conjunctions/transitions (nonetheless, however, although). Due to the development of machine learning algorithms, dealing with negators is no longer the challenge it used to be. Negators in sentences can be detected and processed through n-grams with high-orders based on supervised algorithms <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. Rinker, who developed sentimentr, asserts that negators appear in conjunction with about 20% of polarized words in a sentence. Rinker created valence shifters based on n-grams with high-orders to deal with negators, amplifiers, de-amplifiers, and adversative conjunctions/transitions. Through valence shifters, the accuracy of sentiment analysis has improved, though sentimentr still creates inconsistent results based on the total number of tokens. For example, the sentiment values between the three sentences, She isn’t happy (–0.433), She is not happy (–0.375), and Today, she is not happy (–0.335) are different.</p>
<p>Current sentiment analysis tools still need to improve through alternative approaches. Lexicon-based sentiment analysis has  “the inability to find opinion words with domain and context specific orientations.”   <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The layers of abstraction must be deeper to semantically and syntactically detect sentences in lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools, which simply transform sentiment words into numeric vectors based on sentiment lexicons, then create visualizations to depict the data. Likewise, Syuzhet still fails to properly deal with negators, amplifiers, de-amplifiers, and adversative conjunctions/transitions.</p>

<p>I selected the Syuzhet lexicon to test four different functions with Charles Dickens’s  <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> , George Eliot’s  <em>Middlemarch</em> , and Charlotte Brontë’s  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  in order to examine the compatibility, as well as the limits, of Syuzhet with literature.

Regarding the settings of the get_transformed_values and get_dct_transform functions, scale_vals=FALSE and scale_range=TRUE. The plot trajectory created by the get_sentiment function is complicated and condensed, showing both positive and negative emotion. Nonetheless, it is a useful function when it comes to meticulously grasping sentiment flow in a story.</p>

        <p>Comparison of four different functions based on the Syuzhet lexicon from Charles Dickens’s Our Mutual Friend
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Looking into the raw file after it was processed by the get_sentiment function using the Syuzhet lexicon, 7,167 sentences out of 20,261 sentences scored 0 (neutral), the number of positive sentences was 8,123, and the number of negative sentences was 4,971. The positive average was 0.95, and the negative average was –0.81. Based on the emotion trajectories created by the get_sentiment and get_percentage_values functions, the whole plot of  <em>Our Mutual Friend</em>  is swayed by positive feelings except for eight chapters. The get_sentiment result shows that each chapter entails both positive and negative emotions, and that overall, positive sentiment governs over negative feelings. The get_percentage_values function reveals that there are more negative feelings expressed in books 3 and 4. The highest score (8.7) is found in the last chapter of book 1, x=4907:  “My Dear Sir,–Having consented to preside at the forthcoming Annual Dinner of the Family Party Fund, and feeling deeply impressed with the immense usefulness of that noble Institution and the great importance of its being supported by a List of Stewards that shall prove to the public the interest taken in it by popular and distinguished men, I have undertaken to ask you to become a Steward on that occasion.”   <sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> The results from the get_dct_transform function reveal that  <em>Our Mutual Friend</em>  begins with slightly positive feelings, then reaches a peak of positivity in book 2, before reversing into negativity from book 3. This makes sense, as in book 2, there are a number of jocund and cheerful events, such as Mr. Headstone’s and Mr. Eugene Wrayburn’s wooing towards Lizzie, Mr. Veneering’s luxurious life, Mr. and Mrs. Lammle’s social life, Fledgeby’s smooth business, Mr. Boffin’s purchase of an old mansion, and Bella’s taste for money. The lowest score (–6.5), on the other hand, is found in book 3 chapter 8, x=12262:  “This boastful handiwork of ours, which fails in its terrors for the professional pauper, the sturdy breaker of windows and the rampant tearer of clothes, strikes with a cruel and a wicked stab at the stricken sufferer, and is a horror to the deserving and unfortunate.”   <sup id="fnref2:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> The get_dct_transform function reveals the dominance of negative feelings in the novel from the halfway point, though it becomes positive once more in the ending. Similarly, between x≈10000 and x≈15000 (Book 3) from the get_sentiment function, high values of negative sentiment are often found. Emotions fluctuate in book 3, but the negative atmosphere is dominant in book 3 due to an endless string of troubling plots such as Lizzie’s disappearance and return, Mr. Riderhood’s drowning, Bella’s conflicts about money, Silas Wegg’s plot, Headstone’s jealousy, Mr. and Mrs. Lammle’s bankruptcy, and Mr. Boffin’s anger over Rokesmith. Although chapter 4 is filled with a positive ambience surrounding Mr. and Mrs. Wilfer’s wedding anniversary, the emotional flows of the plot shown by the get_dct_transform function are relatively correct. Still, it is impossible to assert that the get_dct_transform function is 100% correct due to its over-simplification of emotion flows, the inconsistent values of lexicons, and the absence of functions which detect negators, amplifiers, de-amplifiers, and adversative conjunctions/transitions. For example, at x≈20, sentiment is extremely negative in the get_percentage_values function, whereas both the get_transformed_values and get_dct_transform functions have positive values, which are erroneous results caused by the smoothing filter occurring in their functions.</p>
<p>For the first 8% of narrative time, sentiment values are opposite between the get_percentage_values and get_transformed_values functions, with positive and negative scores respectively (figure 4). Here, the get_transformed_values function does not correctly reveal the sentiment trajectories compared to the other functions. As I mentioned above, Jockers does not recommend use of the get_transformed_values function, which has been preserved for legacy purposes, but it should be referenced since the get_dct_transform function derives from the get_transformed_values function. The distinctive difference between the two functions is low pass size. The get_transformed_values and the get_dct_transform functions have low pass sizes of 2 and 5 respectively, which denotes that the get_dct_transform function simplifies sentiment trajectory more than the get_transformed_values function does.</p>

        <p>Comparison of four different functions from Book 4, Chapter 15 and 16 of <em>Our Mutual Friend</em>
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In order to specifically examine the sentiment aspect from figure 4, I chose chapters 15 and 16, both from book 4, which are from x≈96% (19499) to x≈99% (20116) in figure 4. After parsing, chapters 15 and 16 consist of 336 and 282 chunks, respectively. Therefore, in figure 5, chapter 15 is between x=0% and x≈54%, and the rest is chapter 16. Looking into the raw file after it was processed by the get_sentiment function with the Syuzhet lexicon, 154 and 96 sentences in chapter 15 and 16, respectively, scored 0 (neutral), 68 and 129 sentences had positive values, and 114 and 57 sentences recorded negative values. Although the number of sentences in chapter 15 and 16 combined is less than 1000, which might bring about incorrect results, the four visualizations in figure 5 appear to appropriately demonstrate the two chapters. Chapter 15 is comprised of Riderhood’s blackmail towards Headstone and their subsequent death in the river. The scene which depicts Riderhood staying in Headstone’s classroom is filled with tension, and the result of Syuzhet reflects this with negative sentiment values, the lowest of which is (–3.5):  “But, not to be still further defrauded and overreached–which he would be, if implicated by Riderhood, and punished by the law for his abject failure, as though it had been a success–he kept close in his school during the day, ventured out warily at night, and went no more to the railway station.” <sup id="fnref3:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> In addition, negative feelings are dominant due to Headstone’s attempt to drown Riderhood, which results in both of their deaths, and which occurs in the last twenty sentences in chapter 15.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the foundation shapes created by the get_transformed_values and get_dct_transform functions depict positive spikes, whereas the trajectories created by the get_sentiment and get_percentage_values functions at x=317 (x≈51%), to x=336 (x≈54%) correctly show negative spikes. The foundation shapes of Syuzhet, due to its smoothing feature, do not properly handle the drastic sentiment changes from the end of chapter 15, which describes drowning– “When the two were found, lying under the ooze and scum behind one of the rotting gates, Riderhood’s hold had relaxed, probably in falling, and his eyes were staring upward,”   <sup id="fnref4:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> which is given a value of –2.15–to the number of strong positive sentiment values in the beginning of chapter 16. Jockers acknowledges the limits of transforming functions in Syuzhet by noting that  “when a series of sentence values are combined into a larger chunk using a percentage based measure, extremes of emotional valence tend to get watered down.”   <sup id="fnref3:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> The limit of Syuzhet that Jockers admits to does not seem to be applied in isolation to large data, as it is also seen to affect small data.</p>

        <p>Comparison of four different functions based on the Syuzhet lexicon from George Eliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em>
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Like Dicken’s  <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> , George Eliot’s  <em>Middlemarch</em>  is a long Victorian novel, which includes 14,415 sentences after being processed through the get_sentiment function using the Syuzhet lexicon. The number of positive, neutral, and negative sentences from George Eliot’s  <em>Middlemarch</em>  was 7,286, 3,017, and 4,112, respectively. The positive and negative averages were 1.09 and –0.88, respectively. The emotional valence from the get_sentiment and the get_percentage_values reveals the dominance of positive emotion throughout the plots, except for the last part, between x≈85 and x≈95. The emotional trajectories from the get_sentiment and the get_percentage_values precisely depict the ambience of its plots. Although  <em>Middlemarch</em>  has a number of conflicts during the course of the novel between Dorothea Brooke and Mr. Casaubon and between Rosamond Vincy and Lydgate, the flow of  _Middlemarch _ is generally filled with positive feelings with the exception of the end. With the sudden death of Mr. Casaubon and Lydgate, the last part of  <em>Middlemarch</em>  is dominated with negative feelings. However,  <em>Middlemarch</em>  still has a happy ending as Dorothea decides to get married to Will Ladislaw despite the fact that she has to give up her inheritance from Mr. Casaubon when she does so. Rosamond Vincy also remarries another man after losing Lydgate. Mary and Fred live happily together and have children. The happy ending is from x≈98 through 100 (chapter 86 to the finale). The get_sentiment and get_percentage_values functions properly catch the happy ending, whereas the get_transformed_values and get_dct_transform functions do not. In addition, looking into some chapters which have quarrels, there are some parts scored incorrectly by Syuzhet. The highest positive scored sentence is found with a score of 9.05 in chapter 20. Chapter 20 is about the first fight between Dorothea and Mr. Casaubon in Rome after their marriage, which is at x≈25 in figure 6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon, might have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been encouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling — if he would have held her hands between his and listened with the delight of tenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up her experience, and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in return, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual knowledge and affection — or if she could have fed her affection with those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll, creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own love.<br>
<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup><br>
These characteristics signifies Mr. Casaubon’s tenacity of occupation and … eagerness. Looking closely into this long sentence, if is the key word. Without if in this sentence, it would be correct to give this sentence positive scores. In this sentence, there are 20 words which have sentiment scores out of 134 words through the get_tokens and the get_sentiment functions: unchangeable (–0.6), encouraged (0.8), womanly (–0.25), feeling (0.25), delight (1), tenderness (0.8), understanding (1), intimacy (0.8), included (0.6), mutual (0.6), knowledge (0.6), affection (1), affection (1), childlike (0.6), bent (–0.4), sweet (0.75), hard (–0.25), happy (0.75), wealth (0.5), and love (0.75). The sum of the tokens is 10.3, but the sentiment score of the sentence level through the get_sentiment function is 9.05. This is due to the conjunction, if, which affects the sentence level by adding –0.25 with the get_sentiment function, though it does not have a sentiment score as a word. The word affection (1) appeared twice, so affection (1) was only added once in the sentence level, which reveals that Syuzhet avoids summing duplicate sentiment words in sentence levels. The logic used by Syuzhet is meticulous in order to differentiate word and sentence levels. However, Syuzhet failed to semantically detect this sentence and created a faulty sentiment result. This long sentence would have been given negative scores if Syuzhet had a function to semantically detect sentences. In addition, there is another example to examine, which is the second highest scored sentence at 8.1 in chapter 16, which is at x≈21 in figure 6:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Rosamond’s romance it was not necessary to imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his serious business in the world: of course, he had a profession and was clever, as well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate was his good birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which she would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last associate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked down on the Middlemarchers.<br>
<sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup><br>
As seen in the passage above, British authors such as George Eliot, Charles Dickens, and Charlotte Brontë intentionally used colons or semicolons to break long sentences into several parts. Since Syuzhet does not split sentences based on colons, the sentences in the passage above were not separated. This passage reveals Rosamond’s only reason for caring about Lydgate, which is his social rank. It would be more appropriate to consider this passage as having neutral emotion since it is based on Rosamond’s criteria in choosing her husband. In this excerpt, there are 14 words which have sentiment scores out of 108 words through the get_tokens and the get_sentiment functions: romance (0.5), hero (0.75), profession (0.25), clever (0.75), well (0.8), sufficiently (1), handsome (1), good (0.75), birth (0.6), distinguished (0.6), marriage (0.6), prospect (0.6), celestial (0.4), and vulgar (–0.5). There is no duplicates or conjunctions which would make a different sum between the bag of tokens and the bag of sentences. In addition, some words in this part which might have been considered negative have not been scored by the Syuzhet lexicon, such as piquant and look down. Syuzhet simply added the sum of sentiment words, and concluded this part to be the second highest positive sentence in  <em>Middlemarch</em> .</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Charlotte Brontë’s  <em>Jane Eyre</em> , after being processed through the get_sentiment function using the Syuzhet lexicon, included 9,664 sentences. Out of these, 2,776 sentences scored 0 (neutral), 4,046 sentences were positive, and 2,824 sentences were negative. The positive average was 1.08, and the negative average was –0.97. Based on the emotion trajectories created by the four functions, emotions from  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  fluctuate between positive and negative feelings throughout the whole plot. The get_dct_transform result depicts the emotional flow of  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  as fluctuating between negative, positive, negative, and finally positive feelings, whereas the get_percentage_values scrupulously delineates each part with binary emotions. Jane Eyre has difficult times when staying at Gateshead and Lowood due to Mrs. Reed, John Reed, and Mr. Broklehurst, in addition to Helen’s death, which occurs from x≈1 to x≈14. Once Jane moves to Thornfield, she has happier days as Adèle’s governess with the slow growth of her feelings for Rochester until her wedding. Based on the get_percentage_values function, the flow of the emotional valence is positive between x≈15 and x≈60 except for at x≈41. Chapter 20 is full of negative feelings due to Bertha Mason’s attack on Richard Mason, which occurs at x≈41 in figure 7. There is a strong negative spike at x≈41:  “I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust, horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only said —  Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don’t repeat it, ” <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> which is given a score of –4.5. After the chapter, the flow of the emotional valence is positive until the wedding day. The get_percentage_values function correctly depicts the emotional valence of this part, whereas the get_dct_transform does not. The wedding was canceled with Mr. Mason’s disclosure of the fact that Rochester is already married. Jane reveals her severe feelings when deciding to leave Thornfield:  “I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded depths of agony,”   <sup id="fnref1:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> which is given a score of –4.65 by Syuzhet at x≈61. After her marriage is canceled, Jane’s hardships continue as a street beggar until she settles in at Moor House and Morton. Jane moves to a small cottage, and again experiences a positive life as a teacher at x≈76 (Chapter 31). When Jane finds Rochester in Ferndean, there are sentences which reveal negative emotions:  “He [Rochester] was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to amputate it directly,” <sup id="fnref2:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> which is given a score of –3.25 by Syuzhet at x≈93 (Chapter 36), and which the get_percentage_values function detects precisely. The ending of  _Jane Eyre _ arouses positive feelings with the successful marriage of Jane and Rochester.</p>
<p>The most negative sentence from  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  has a score of –7.2 in chapter 27, which occurs at x≈63 in figure 7, where Rochester explains about Bertha Mason after the cancellation of their wedding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife, even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger — when I found that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile — when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory, exacting orders — even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.<br>
<sup id="fnref3:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup><br>
This passage reveals that Syuzhet does not split sentences based on dashes and semicolons. In this excerpt, there are 27 words which have sentiment scores out of 173 words through the get_tokens and the get_sentiment functions: vile (-0.75), treachery (-0.5), concealment (-0.8), reproach (-0.5), found (0.6), alien (-0.6), obnoxious (-0.75), incapable (-0.75), led (0.4), found (0.6), comfort (0.75), kindly (0.5), received (0.6), coarse (-0.6), perverse (-0.5), imbecile (-0.75), quiet (0.25), household (0.6), violent (-0.75), unreasonable (-0.5), temper (-0.5), absurd (-0.75), contradictory (-0.5), exacting (-0.25), devour (-0.4), disgust (-1), and antipathy (-0.5). The sum of the word tokens is -7.35. After excluding the duplicated word, found, the sum should be -7.95, but the Syuzhet score is -7.2. This is because Syuzhet perceives words with dashes as being together. In this part, imbecile should have been counted as -0.75, but imbecile was processed as imbecile — when, which is considered null by Syuzhet. Although Syuzhet successfully labeled this part as negative, it shows the limits of the Syuzhet functions.</p>

<p>The most positive sentence from  <em>Jane Eyre</em>  scored a 9.05 in chapter 32, which is at x≈78 in figure 7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it, when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness), but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive<br>
<sup id="fnref4:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup><br>
This is Jane’s positive description of Rosamond Oliver. In this part, there are 19 words which have sentiment scores out of 69 words through the get_tokens and the get_sentiment functions: hasty (–0.5), good (0.75), vain (–1), flush (–0.4), loveliness (1), innocent (0.8), pride (0.25), wealth (0.5), ingenuous (1), sufficiently (1), intelligent (1), lively (0.75), charming (1), cool (0.75), sex (0.1), like (0.5), profoundly (0.8), interesting (0.75), and impressive (0.75). Syuzhet seems to successfully detect this part as positive. The original score should be 9.8 instead of 9.05 since good-humoured was not separately detected in the sentence level due to the dash, which means good (0.75) was not counted towards the sentiment score sum in this part. However, in the last sentence,  “but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive,”  Syuzhet failed to detect the negation not and simply added scores from the words, profoundly (0.8), interesting (0.75), and impressive (0.75) without reversing them, which brought about incorrect results.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through the sentiment analysis of the three novels, the get_transformed_values and get_dct_transform functions do not indicate sophistication of emotion, since their purpose is to grasp the whole emotional flow of plots by simplifying the emotional valence with a smoothing filter, whereas the get_sentiment and get_percentage_values functions create more detailed results of the emotional valence, which is more appropriate for micro sentiment analysis. Syuzhet reveals its limits through the lack of functions to detect dashes, negators, and adversative conjunctions/transitions, which brings about faulty results. Syuzhet does not detect the syntactical and semantic information of each sentence, but simply transforms each word found in the lexicons into numerical sentiment vectors. In addition, the application of DCT for sentiment analysis of literary texts is still questionable as the graphs of sentiment analysis generated with DCT are over-simplified and often incorrect. Syuzhet has been the most popular sentiment analysis tool for R despite its limits. However, it will continue to be questionable as a research tool in the digital humanities without overcoming the limits mentioned above.</p>
<p>Sentiment analysis has been developed with the implementation of machine learning and deep learning approaches, which attempt to solve the issues it faces. Deep learning in natural language process has shown a shining future for sentiment analysis. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNN) which include the convolution stage, detector stage, and pooling stage can improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis by detecting locality and negativity of words. Bing Liu notes that opinion words have different meanings depending on the context <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. For example, the sentences, I am not happy to work out and I am happy not to work out, have different meanings. The locality of not can be processed in pooling layers, which are usually applied after the convolutional and detector stages. For example, MALLET (MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit), <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  a text mining toolkit, employs conditional random fields (CRF), including the Naïve Bayes classifier and decision trees. CRF is an efficient method of natural language processing that fixes the issues of two previous models, namely HMM [Hidden Markov Model] and MEMM [Maximum Entropy Markov Model]. Using deep neural network (DNN) models with word embeddings, which are  “typically pre-trained,”  made it possible for the learned word vectors to  “capture general syntactical and semantic information.”   <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> Similarly, the BERT model, which was created and released by Google AI researchers in 2018, possesses the possibility of application for sentiment analysis with literary texts. BERT, a bidirectional language model, performs a variety of natural language tasks based on a pretrained model with a deep bidirectional transformer that achieves  “state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level  <em>and</em>  token-level tasks.”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> The recent experiment by Haider et al. <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> revealed the inconsistent results of fine-tuning the BERT-Base model for the sentiment analysis of poems, due to the lack of vocabulary in poems. While deep learning cannot achieve perfect results, current research shows that deep-learning based sentiment analysis has higher accuracy than lexicon-based sentiment analysis. Stephen Ramsay mentions that  “the real failure would not be a result that is deemed incorrect”  but  “the decision to banish”  computational literary analysis entirely <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Although it would require the collaborative creation of literary datasets for deep learning-based sentiment analysis, we should strive to implement deep learning models for sentiment analysis in the digital humanities.</p>
<p>It is painstaking to improve the precision, accuracy, and efficiency of digital tools, and the process entails a great deal of effort, emotion, time, and money, which are also needed to maintain tools after development. Some scholars show disdain for and misunderstanding of the funding necessities for DH projects by stating that  “almost all of the works”  can be recreated with only one laptop <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> As a mobile/web developer, whenever I had meetings with clients interested in making apps without in-depth knowledge in the IT field, there was always a common qualm about costs to develop apps, before they even thought about the cost of future maintenance. To create a simple app that contains only a few functions requires a project manager, iOS/Android developers, back-end developers, and an UI/UX designer. DH projects are no different: Amy Earhart and Toniesha Taylor shared their experiences facing institutional funding issues while collaborating on a DH project <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. Due to insufficient funding in the humanities field, it will be challenging to develop new algorithms/functions and maintain Syuzhet. Syuzhet is a free digital tool that will continue to be developed even though, like any other existing computer program, it is not perfect. I believe that the necessary improvements will be made to Syuzhet for semantically and syntactically detecting sentences, so long as digital humanists support Syuzhet. Improving sentiment analysis as well as digital tools should not remain only as the duty of developers or labs, but as a responsibility of all digital humanists who employ digital tools by participating in making improvements through the provision of feedback, such as that in Swafford’s blog post. We need to keep testing and providing feedback to improve tools like Syuzhet for the affluence, development, and application of sentiment analysis in literature.</p>

<p>In 2003, UNESCO established their Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH),  “to ensure better visibility of the intangible cultural heritage and awareness of its significance, and to encourage dialogue which respects cultural diversity”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Subsequently, the Chinese government launched a national campaign to promote the recognition, discovery, and conservation of ICH. As a result, 42 types of ICH in China have been added to the UNESCO list and China is the country with the highest number of ICH elements on the list as of December 2020.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  The national and local governments in China consider the conservation and promotion of ICH to be crucial to enhancing national identity, amplifying cultural heritage, raising consciousness about the need to protect cultural heritage, and promoting Chinese culture both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>High-performance technology was promoted as an important method for the conservation and distribution of ICH. Many IT companies are used to working with museums to digitize ICH. While it is important to promote ICH to broad audiences, high-performance technology requires technical skills and equipment that bear high costs. Moreover, it is crucial to work directly with craftspeople to better understand the goals and outcomes of conservation. Our work on ZHI: A Digital Project of Traditional Craftsmanship, developed by graduate students at Nanjing University’s School of Arts, offers an alternative that incorporates minimal computing technologies and direct collaboration with creators of ICH.</p>
<p>The project began with our Designer Residency Program, developed in 2017 to bring together designers, craftspeople, non-governmental organization (NGO) workers, and administrators from cultural institutions. As we visited local studios and interviewed designers and craftspeople, we sought to understand the obstacles to digitally preserving and transmitting knowledge about craftsmanship in Nanjing. What became clear is that it was impractical to launch a multi-year training program to share Nanjing’s ICH with amateurs or hobbyists. Seeking alternatives, we interviewed designers, craftspeople, students, and potential audiences interested in learning more about craftsmanship. We further explored digital technologies that would be user-friendly and economical for preserving ICH.</p>
<p>This research led to even more questions: How could we bridge the gap between enthusiastic consumers and the little-known creators of ICH? How could we create opportunities for students to learn about and contribute to craftwork? How could we facilitate a sustainable process of knowledge production about ICH among the audiences, students, and craftsmen so everyone benefited and had opportunities to contribute?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we developed ZHI, a digital craftsmanship project.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  As indicated in the name, this project establishes a model of knowing and making to strengthen knowledge production on craftsmanship in the digital era. ZHI is dedicated to showcasing the beauty of traditional craftsmanship at three levels — knowing, making, and intelligence — and providing sources of imagination and cultural roots for contemporary hobbyists. As a shareable network supported by the community, it aims to provide a user-friendly, knowledge-based, and accessible website for craftspeople who do not possess expensive digital equipment and experienced skills to virtually present their craft or research, share their knowledge, and tell their stories to audiences who may only know a little about the craftsmanship.</p>
<h2 id="making-as-knowing-and-technological-needs-for-ich">Making-as-knowing and Technological Needs for ICH</h2>
<p>According to UNESCO’s 2003 Convention, ICH connotes the  “practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, and know-how, transmitted from generation to generation within communities, created and transformed continuously by them, depending on the environment and their interaction with nature and history”   <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Its importance lies in the way it  “adapts permanently to the present and constitutes cultural capital that can be a powerful driver for development. Food security, health, education, sustainable use of natural resources — intangible cultural heritage is a wealth of knowledge to be used in many aspects of life”   <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Rather than emphasizing historical value, unique places, or material objects, ICH focuses on the living status of heritage in the communities — ensuring it can be known, learned, and transmitted from generation-to-generation and thus remain alive — as well as the human spirit that lies in communities and provides a sense of identity that promotes broader cultural and social effects. Starting from the understanding of ICH as living heritage, we adopted three key concepts to develop a sustainable model to help practitioners share the knowledge and skills of ICH. From the process of making and producing digital twins of ICH, supported technically by the strategies of minimal computing — that is, using accessible technologies — we designed a flexible website to showcase the knowledges, communities, and aesthetic values of ICH.</p>
<p>In the case of the ZHI project, digitization of craftsmanship is not simply duplicating products, but a process of making digital twins, a term used by Michael Grieves to describe  “a virtual representation of what has been produced”  in his project for his Product Lifestyle Management Development Consortium. Grieves suggests one could,  “Compare a Digital Twin to its engineering design to better understand what was produced versus what was designed, tightening the loop between design and execution”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. By adopting and applying the term digital twins to cultural heritage, Pierre-André Jouan and Pierre Hallot indicate that implementing digital twins for the management and preservation of cultural heritage assets would assist with data collection and management for cultural heritage, which will in turn provide initial and long-term support for the conservation of cultural heritage. This all relies on the value attributed to the form of cultural heritage, while evaluation of that value itself depends on data preservation <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. In this sense, the ZHI project considers digitization, data collection, and analysis as a process of making digital twins of craftsmanship. This process requires knowledge about material, the skill of making, the emotion and time required, and the use of proper equipment. The outcomes — physical product and digital content — are interdependent and complement each other. Under the principle of making-as-knowing, digitization, data collection, and analysis provide an epistemological approach to the knowledge of craftsmanship and its virtual representations.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the principle of living heritage, we take the sustainable production of knowledge as the core of the ZHI project to encourage craftspeople to pass their skills and knowledge onto others, particularly younger generations, through digitization and online exhibition. During this process, we discovered that while craftspeople know how to make things by drawing on their skills, it is difficult for them to convert the knowledge that they learned from their practical experiences into what Ulrich Lehmann calls a systematic knowledge shape. Lehman notes this difficulty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If making is knowing, it doesn’t follow that all makers know their crafts. They might know how to produce an effective, economical, or detailed result. But this does not mean that they can change completely, reverse, or deconstruct their techne in such a way as to challenge established thinking about this craft.<br>
<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><br>
Lehmann reminds us that Plato and Aristotle’s metaphorical expression of the distinction between knowledge and techne universalized and empowered making processes, such as weaving and clothes-making. These are epistemological processes of knowledge production that go  “beyond material creation, and thus constitute[s] conceptual knowledge”   <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Following Lehmann, epistemology is not just about the conditions of knowledge origins, its structures, and limits, but more importantly the creation, distribution, and consumption processes. Lehmann’s study of pleated fabrics in the context of fashion illustrates his argument, but his analysis is largely analog, not digital. Yet, he raises crucial questions that are pertinent to our digital work:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If making is knowing, can its conditional base be separated and evaluated independently?&hellip;. Are craft techniques, the communal structures of craftspeople, the sociability of crafting, and the consumption of crafted forms to be seen as conditional for the generation of knowing? <sup id="fnref2:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extending these questions to the digital realm, is digital technology conditional for the making-knowing process of craftsmanship now? Does the digital making process also produce knowing/knowledge for the new generation?</p>
<p>Yes, we think so. Our work is inspired by projects like the Making and Knowing Project, a  “research and pedagogical initiative in the Center for Science and Society at Columbia University that explores the intersections between artistic making and scientific knowing,”  where craftspeople represent their skills and knowledge through their own voices and stories <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. While our project emphasizes the role of digital technology in the conservation of cultural heritage, the Making and Knowing Project provides a research-driven model of pedagogy by creating an open-access digital critical edition of an anonymous French manuscript through text- and object-based research and hands-on reconstruction. Students not only reconstruct 16th- and 17th-century culinary recipes but also collect data and record the acquisition process through field notes; this illuminates the making-as-knowing process as students undertake working processes similar to those of artists or craftspeople. What they have explored and examined, as presented on the project’s website, fills the missing spots in the historical documents: students have decoded and brought tacit components of knowledge back to the surface from the deeply encoded texts in the 16th and 17th centuries through their digital representations and the work of remediation. The students’ digital engagements transform tacit knowledge of the early modern period into comprehensible common knowledge, bringing insights from the early modern period to contemporary audiences.</p>
<p>Inspired by the making as knowing principle and the Making and Knowing Project, the ZHI project invited the craftspeople to work with the undergraduate and graduate students. During the collaboration process, craftspeople learned to use language that young people understand to explain the tacit knowledge behind the texts and objects. Students also needed to learn how to use texts, images, and videos — the digital content that represents not only the material craft product but also the knowledge and emotions of craftspeople — to demonstrate the value of crafts to users in virtual environments. This is a making process of both material media and translations of knowledge across different languages systems.</p>
<p>Strategies of minimal computing undergird this work on the ZHI project because it fits our needs and provides a framework for theorizing our practices. In  “The User, the Learner and the Machines We Make,”  Alex Gil asks the question,  “What do we need?”  to open a discussion of necessity-based technical practices, articulating a concern about  “how to produce, disseminate, and preserve digital scholarship ourselves, without the help we can’t get, even as we fight to build the infrastructures we need at the intersection of and beyond our libraries and schools”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. We fully agree with Gil’s argument that the orientations of digital knowledge production should be towards the  “ease of use, ease of creation”   <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Because ZHI is a student-based research project with little grant funding, ensuring the sustainability and affordability of both labor and technology was the first, perhaps most important, concern for the project.</p>
<p>In contrast, the digital heritage community in China trends towards fetishizing technology. The more advanced and expensive digital technologies or devices are, the more popular they are. Recently, virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) have become popular in the national digital heritage community. However, not all types of cultural heritage or ICH are suitable for VR/AR, even though VR/AR have been strongly recommended and supported by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Are they necessary for the ZHI project? No. The required terminal display equipment and the cost of modeling 3D content, as well as easily outdated operating environments, are unaffordable luxuries for individual craftspeople and students. Even with the possibility of grant funding, the question remains about who could continue maintaining content and customized technologies for VR/AR when the funding runs out. Rather than following the VR/AR trend, we considered the purpose of using technologies, focusing on the question of  “what we need.”  We further considered which technologies would allow ZHI project participants to engage in the hands-on making-as-knowing process with digital technologies, rather than outsourcing the making process and turning our technologies into a figurative “black box” for craftspeople and students. With the strategic framework of minimal computing, the ZHI project maximizes the use of only the most necessary technologies and the most effective ways to expose the most important, but often neglected, aspects of ICH: the beauty of handcrafts and the wisdom of craftspeople.</p>
<h2 id="simple-but-beautiful-as-a-core-approach">Simple but Beautiful as a Core Approach</h2>
<p>Inspired by the concepts listed above, the ZHI team examined three types of traditional craftsmanship in Nanjing: Yunjin brocade, gold foil forging, and velvet flower making. In addition to originating in Nanjing, all three are closely related to the silk industry. Due to existing market needs, especially for gold foil, craftspeople are still living within self-identified communities. To preserve ICH, craftspeople need to collaborate with researchers to digitally conserve and promote the crafts. The ZHI project helps facilitate such collaborations.</p>
<p>Our team consists of graduate and undergraduate students from different disciplines and our approach combines the study of documents and images with fieldwork and collaboration with craftspeople. The first stage of the project focused on identifying challenges to the preservation of intangible cultural heritage through fieldwork. Through our international Designers-in-Residency program, we worked closely with designers, craftspeople, NGO workers, and administrators of cultural institutions. We visited local studios and interviewed designers and craftspeople, discussing the obstacles of digital preservation for Nanjing’s ICH.</p>
<p>Through our visits and interviews, we identified two challenges. First, craftspeople do not have a systematic digital record of their products, skills, tools, and stories, since they are not part of the museum system. As a result, the value of their work has not been recognized by cultural heritage authorities. Some organizations, such as television stations, interview craftspeople but not all of these organizations give copies of images, audio, videos, and texts back to the craftspeople. Additionally, craftspeople do not have their own physical or virtual archives to preserve their work, documents, and ephemera.</p>
<p>Second, it is almost impossible to help designers from different cultural contexts understand an artifact with a 2000-year-old history of complicated techniques, complex meanings behind colors and patterns, or that these groups of people spend their whole lives weaving a textile or making a fan. They can respect it but not understand it. This happens with students too, even when they share the same cultural contexts as these craftspeople. Students love these beautiful artifacts and enthusiastically want to know more about them, but they do not know how to acquire that knowledge. Not all students are from the local area, so some are unfamiliar with the culture. But, more importantly, as a younger generation, they do not have first-hand knowledge and experience of traditional craftsmanship — just surface knowledge from books, museums, tourist stores, and TV shows, which are carefully illustrated, elucidated, encoded, and programmed by authoritative researchers, professionals, and product designers. Students seldom have a chance to have hands-on experiences with the making process that is needed to acquire the deep, tacit knowledge of craftsmanship and craftspeople themselves.</p>
<p>Based on the insights from the first stage of our project, in the second stage we chose to establish a digital website to virtually represent craftsmanship to general audiences and create an archive for craftspeople to digitally preserve their works, processes, and stories. We also adopted a research-driven pedagogical model; the process of developing the website engaged students in making-as-knowing, as they worked with the craftspeople to select, digitize, design, and interpret content, with the help of collaborators, such as researchers, photographers, and programmers.</p>
<p>The ZHI project carefully chose four ways to collect data: (1) taking photos, (2) making short video clips, (3) searching for free copyright images, and (4) conducting oral history interviews (see Figure 1). Most of the filming is done on students’ phones, and they can edit them on their laptops with video editing software. We ask them to strictly follow our protocols of data collection, which have been designed and customized by us, so the filming and editing work is also part of the scientific investigation process and includes consent of the craftspeople (see Figures 2 and 3). For example, students have to clearly understand the name and purpose of every step in the development of a craft, as well as additional considerations, such as why we should take a photo of silk yarn from a particular perspective — because the reflection of silk yarn in a different light will affect color representation. Students also have to understand why particular patterns have to be arranged next to another one — because royal rules in ancient China dictated the whole pattern for clothes. All of this detailed information about ICH has to be included alongside the photos, videos, and interactive games they create.</p>

<p>Since the content is lightweight, we designed an HTML5/PHP-based, highly flexible website for images, videos, texts, and interactive games with a freelance developer.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  All of the modules are image-based and can be edited as needed (see Figures 4 and 5). For example, we designed an interactive coloring game of Yunjin brocade to illustrate the rules and principles of</p>
<p>color selection and matching in brocade making. All elements of the game are image-based and can be replaced and changed accordingly so the game can be extended to different patterns with different color palettes. For now, we use a line drawing named  _ 翠蓝地加金缠枝莲花牡丹妆花   _ from the book  _Yunjin Patterns _ (1959), drawn by Chen Zhifo, a very famous artist and educator of the last century, and a color palette digitized by us from the physical color card of a craftsman, Wang Jisheng, who has been working on silk dyes for decades. Users can easily interact with the pattern to make their own design and then download the image as a calendar page to their computer (see Figures 6, 7, and 8).</p>

<p>Simple does not mean inelegant. On the contrary, we want to make the website simple but beautiful. By studying the materials, tools, making process, and products, and talking with craftspeople, we developed our 3S principle as we found that the  <em>scales</em> ,  <em>scene</em> , and  <em>scenario</em>  are very important for virtual representation. This principle begins with the idea that beauty is based on understanding, not intuition alone. For example, to present a pattern, an image should present a minimal unit of pattern with an explanation of the meaning of each element, rather than showing a photo with just a title. In this sense,  <em>scale</em>  is crucial for understanding (see Figure 9). Second, beauty emerges in context. Craftsmanship is rooted in history, so we have to go back to the  <em>scene</em>  of history to understand it. While craftsmanship may have seemed to have disappeared from daily life, we can trace it in some  <em>scenes</em>  of contemporary culture, such as paintings or TV soap dramas (see Figure 10). Finally, beauty is constructed by narratives. Beauty is complex but we can select specific  <em>scenarios</em>  and the most tangible and touching moments for storytelling (see Figure 11).</p>

<h2 id="insights-from-the-zhi-project">Insights from the ZHI Project</h2>
<p>Since the launch of the ZHI website, we have received compliments and feedback from craftspeople and researchers alike. Reflecting on our process, we can summarize the lessons we learned. First, developing a sharable knowledge network is essential. We are fortunate to have many collaborators working with us on the ZHI project, including craftspeople, dyeing experts, scholars, designers, and museum curators. They examine our workflow, protocol, and principles, and give students seminars and workshops on dyeing and color analysis. The students work very closely with craftspeople to record and annotate all the photos of procedure and craft works. During this process, tacit knowledge is circulated among this collaborative community and students’ experiences merge into knowledge production and become a new branch of the digital twin of craftsmanship. Consequently, three students from the team decided to work in cultural heritage fields after they graduated — another outcome of this project.</p>
<p>Next, based on the principle of mutually beneficial sharing, all photos, video, and oral history texts taken by us from the local studios and craftspeople are given back to them as documents. Meanwhile, all materials are authorized by craftspeople and local museums and presented on our website as  <em>their</em>  own archives, so it is not necessary for them to establish another one. Our team routinely visits their studios to help them digitize and record their newly made craft works.</p>
<p>Further, establishing data collection specifications from the beginning and following them throughout the research and technical processes is crucial to sustainability and scalability. Minimal computing shaped our decision to set a variety of rules before the actual work began and to undertake both data collection and our technical work carefully. For example, the students record all of the scientific data as they learn about dyeing and, in turn, all images of craftsmanship on the website are also color-managed so that accurate and effective color analysis can be performed.</p>
<p>Our hope is that the ZHI project offers a model for others working to present ICH digitally in an economic and aesthetic way. While ZHI tries to decode the knowledge of craftsmanship and present the beauty of craftsmanship with minimal computing, several concerns arose with the launch of the website, chiefly sustainability and permanence. The construction of the website was largely supported by Nanjing University, Nanjing Art Foundation, and established partnerships with craftspeople, but the operation and maintenance of the website requires continued investment in human and financial resources. At the same time, we have started to promote the ZHI model to the community of elders as well as to middle school students. Through these new developments, we aim to develop a new operational model to promote ICH in the broader community.</p>

<p>In recent years, increased concern over media degradation and obsolescence combined with the decreasing cost of digital storage has led libraries, archives, and museums (LAMs) to digitize audiovisual (AV) materials for improved access and long-term preservation. Yet, improving preservation and access must go far beyond digitization. The fact that digital AV collections are not well-represented in our national and international digital platforms, such as Europeana and the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), demonstrates complicated factors surrounding how LAM institutions manage and facilitate access to digital surrogates. As of July 2020, Europeana comprised 55% images and 42% text objects, but only 1% sound objects and .5% video objects <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. DPLA included 67% images and 32% text, with less than 1% sound objects, and moving image objects <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. AV collections often include lectures, panels, and speeches; performances such as story-telling, oral histories, and poetry or dance performances; and other documentary AV historical artifacts. Yet, even while they are sometimes the only record of an event or an aural, visual, or performance tradition, AV digital artifacts remain underused and understudied. The goal of the AudiAnnotate Extensible Workflow (AWE) project is to accelerate access to, promote scholarship and teaching with, and extend understanding of significant digital AV collections in the humanities.</p>
<p><em>The State of Recorded Sound Preservation in the United States: A National Legacy at Risk in the Digital Age</em>  (2010) by the Council on Library and Information Resources and the Library of Congress reports that if AV collections go unused, libraries and archives that hold AV collections from a diverse range of time periods, cultures, and contexts will not prioritize their preservation <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. One successful response to the 2010 report has been the Radio Preservation Task Force (RPTF) of the Library of Congress. Created 2014, the RPTF’s primary goal has been  “to support collaboration between faculty researchers and archivists toward the preservation of radio history”  by developing an online inventory of extant American radio archival collections and pedagogical guides for utilizing radio and sound archives <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. While significant work, this kind of inventory only provides surface-level access to limited information about some artifacts. A persistent lack of descriptive metadata about the content of AV materials continues to stand in the way of further levels of access and use.</p>
<p>While increasingly more AV objects might be digitized, under-resourced LAMs must still spend valuable human labor listening to or watching AV media in real time to generate the basic metadata required to make these items indexable, searchable, and accessible online. LAMs often hold physical media artifacts that are unmarked and lacking important identifiable information such as title, date, location, subject, participants, or context. Beyond creating access and discovery points for researchers, this basic information can help LAM professionals organize these materials as well as decide whether there are cultural sensitivity, privacy, or copyright concerns at play in creating access to them. Generating the needed metadata is prohibitively time-consuming, and automatic, machine-generated metadata is an expensive process still very much in research and development and certainly not accessible to all.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Even with simple metadata, AV materials may not include enough information to pique researcher and student engagement. Annotations are what John Unsworth has called a scholarly primitive — an essential humanities method for adding context and meaning to cultural objects of study for use in research, teaching, and publication <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Researchers annotate books when they are taking notes; students annotate print-outs of poems when they are discussing them in class; friends annotate faces on images on social media when they are trying to direct attention to a person on their post. With AV materials, users may want to annotate particular events such as when a speaker is speaking and who they are; the presence of chickens, gunshots, helicopters, or feedback from the crowd for a better sense of context; or when a speaker laughs, sings, yodels, plays an instrument, or switches languages in order to understand the genre of or audience for a performance. Annotations have been the basis for engaging audiences with cultural objects from the era of monks creating commentary on medieval manuscripts to current online scholarly pages, editions, and exhibits <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Sometimes, if an AV object is not available online, annotations can provide context, like being able to read liner notes for a missing album. Further possibilities for access include the ability for scholars, students, or the public involved in larger projects across institutions to systematically, collaboratively annotate or the ability for LAMs to showcase user annotations by including them back into their digital asset management (DAM) systems. Presently, however, even when AV materials are made accessible by LAM institutions, these digital objects remain inaccessible for annotation and therefore inaccessible for learning, public comment, scholarship, and general use.</p>
<p>Annotating is only one of a list of scholarly primitives including discovering, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and representing <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) is one standardized solution that LAMs have adopted to give users the ability to perform these primitives with images held in cultural heritage institutions. Comprising 56 global members including major research universities, national libraries, and world-renowned museums, archives, software companies, and other organizations, the IIIF Consortium has worked together since Fall 2011 to create, test, refine, implement, and promote the IIIF specifications for interoperable functionality and collaboration across repositories. IIIF uses linked data and W3C web standards to facilitate sharing digital image data, migrating across technology systems, and using third-party software to enhance access to images, allowing for viewing, zooming, comparing, manipulating, and working with annotated images on the Web. With IIIF, users can reference images linked from LAMs into software that allows them to manipulate the images in new ways without impacting the institution’s presentation of the item. Universal Viewer, for example, which has been under development by Digirati since 2012, is a community-developed open source project that allows users to zoom into an image using the IIIF image application programming interface (API), create annotations, and generate links to the zoomed, annotated regions. As a result, a user can focus on one part of Vincent Van Gogh’s painting  <em>Irises</em>  at the J. Paul Getty Museum and annotate a particular brush-stroke. She can save this view, compare it against another part of the painting or another painting, and share this view with others. Storiiies is another project that demonstrates how third-party software can help users engage images at holding institutions to generate digital stories. In both cases, the institutions’ use of IIIF allows researchers to implement a broad range of online tools to discover, compare, refer, sample, illustrate, and represent their interpretations of these cultural heritage objects, which in turn encourages their broader use.</p>
<p>As of June 2020, the IIIF-AV Technical Specification Group has extended the existing IIIF Presentation API (version 3) to accommodate rendering AV in a web browser. The AV group is actively welcoming contributions to their collection of AV user stories, mockups, and prototypes in order to make sure IIIF-AV is used by a broad audience. While IIIF has shared use cases for different kinds of AV manifests, including for album covers, oral histories, multi-track recordings, and AV with sign language, tools for exposing and playing these manifests are still under development.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  Freely available, Universal Viewer displays annotations as captions on AV materials, but the annotations cannot be used to navigate the object or be shown separately from the AV object, a necessity for oft-restricted AV materials. The AWE project builds on these IIIF accomplishments, addressing the gaps in engaging with AV by developing a solution to bring together free AV annotation tools and the Web as a standardized collaboration and presentation platform.</p>
<p>In response to the need for a workflow that supports IIIF manifest creation, collaborative editing, flexible modes of presentation, and permissions control, the AudiAnnotate Extensible Workflow (AWE) connects open source tools for annotation (such as Audacity), public code and document repositories (GitHub), and the AudiAnnotate web application for creating and sharing IIIF manifests and annotations. Usually limited by proprietary software and LAM systems with restricted access to AV, researchers can use AWE as a complete sequence of tools and transformations for accessing, identifying, annotating, and sharing annotations. LAMs will benefit from AWE as it facilitates metadata generation, is built on W3C web standards in IIIF for sharing online scholarship, and generates static web pages that are lightweight and easy to preserve and harvest. AWE represents a new kind of AV ecosystem where the exchange is opened between institutional repositories, annotation software, online repositories and publication platforms, and researchers.</p>
<h2 id="technical-development">Technical Development</h2>
<p>AWE owes much of its architectural direction to two projects that are built on the tenets of minimal computing: Readux (produced by the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship) and Ed. (developed by Alex Gil, in collaboration with Susanna Allés Torrent, Terry Catapano, and Johann Gillium). Readux is a tool for visually annotating digitized books and publishing the annotated texts as free-standing editions. Although the Readux application is a traditional web application (based on Django running against a Postgres database), when researchers export their editions, the images, text, and commentary are converted into static websites built using Jekyll and published to GitHub Pages. Ed. accomplishes a similar goal — producing static sites hosting digital editions — but uses an even simpler, Jekyll-based architecture to convert TEI-XML source or Markdown to web pages. Using Jekyll-based static sites and free hosting on GitHub pages is a sustainable model for hosting digital scholarship.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  The combination of a full web application for scholarly annotation and data processing with an export to a static site for preservation and presentation is the basis of the AWE approach.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>The AudiAnnotate web application architecture is lightweight. Researchers create their own time-stamped annotations, provide a URL to the AV item, and upload the annotations to the AudiAnnotate application, which creates a static site that includes a playable edition or exhibit where the artifact, the annotations, and any introductory or other explanatory material can be viewed together. As a Ruby-on-Rails application that does not store data locally, the AudiAnnotate application eliminates the need to run a database or datastore. The application can be installed on a small, cloud instance, a 1GB Linode shared instance costing $5 USD per month. A further advantage to a databaseless architecture is that if the AudiAnnotate web application goes offline, the artifacts it produces will still be available on GitHub. Users with a basic understanding of Jekyll or Markdown can edit AudiAnnotate-created sites without the web application running at all. Furthermore, any other installation of the AudiAnnotate web application will have access to the same data created by previous installations, allowing projects to be transported from one institution to another without data migration.</p>
<p>The AudiAnnotate workflow (AWE) is built on what coders call glue code — code that sticks a bunch of things together to make something useful. Annotation tools such as Audacity give users robust AV analysis and labelling tools from which a simple text file can be exported and used in AudiAnnotate. The AudiAnnotate application wraps references to online AV files and annotations in IIIF manifests to make them presentable in the Universal Viewer and publishes the sites using Jekyll to generate static pages.  Even the app itself takes advantage of the Ruby on Rails web framework, Open Source libraries for authentication and displaying tables, and GitHub to store everything it produces.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Researchers log into the AudiAnnotate web application using their GitHub account (enabled via GitHub’s OpenAuth implementation), which in turn enables the application to read from and write to that user’s repositories on GitHub. In order to prevent AudiAnnotate from modifying other projects under a researcher’s GitHub account, the application restricts its access to repositories tagged with the topic audiannotate.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  Once logged into the application, a researcher can start a new project, which creates a new repository under their account and populates it with a Jekyll template built to read AWE projects. It is important to note that the AudiAnnotate software does not store AV files or provide a means to generate annotations.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  A researcher adds an item to their project through the AudiAnnotate web form by providing a URL to an online AV object, a file that contains time-stamped annotations to that AV object, and minimal metadata about the AV source. When a user adds an item, the web application converts their form input into a IIIF v3.0 manifest JSON file, and saves it to the _data directory of the Jekyll site along with a stub page for the item. The resulting static site serves both the IIIF manifest as JSON and presents the AV file and its metadata on a static page embedding the Universal Viewer for playing the AV. When a researcher uploads the time-stamped annotation file they have already created, the AudiAnnotate application builds WebAnnotation JSON files, which are rendered into a static site by Jekyll and linked to the embedded viewer, allowing users to play related segments of AV by clicking on an annotation. Further interactivity — like sorting or filtering annotations — is provided through the JavaScript library DataTables.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<p>Dependency on GitHub is the biggest limitation on the process of producing AudiAnnotate sites. Since AudiAnnotate relies not only on Git but on the GitHub API, producing new AudiAnnotate sites would be impossible without GitHub. In addition, legal sanctions prevent scholars in Iran, Cuba, and other countries from using GitHub <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. However, once the AudiAnnotate application creates a static site that is published to GitHub, that site does not have to stay on GitHub. A git clone command or a zip download copies the site to a local computer, after which it can be run locally, served from any web server, or stored in a digital preservation system.</p>
<p>While the system works well when only a few people are building AudiAnnotate sites, its reliance on GitHub can be a bottleneck when larger groups like a workshop or classroom all attempt to build sites at the same time. AudiAnnotate’s first workshop ran into a Too many requests error from GitHub because participants were pinging the GitHub API to simply list their existing AudiAnnotate projects. This was a limitation of the  “no database”  architecture — the AudiAnnotate app had no data to show without a connection to GitHub. Consequently, the application’s GitHub API connection was updated to use the authenticated user everywhere possible, which reduced the number of requests via the unauthenticated API connection. While the issue was resolved for the second workshop, delays still occurred in responses to API requests and when building sites. Because GitHub did not return a web page immediately when a request was kicked off, some users experienced errors. Ultimately, using the freely available services of a corporate-funded system like GitHub can be useful, especially for projects and teams with less funding, but it is one that comes with limitations.</p>
<h2 id="audiannotate-use-case-examples">AudiAnnotate Use Case Examples</h2>
<p>The use case examples presented here include four kinds of projects that demonstrate how AWE provides new kinds of access to audio and video artifacts. The first example is an audio scholarly edition by Tanya Clement titled <a href="https://tanyaclement.github.io/znh_jacksonville_1939/"> “Zora Neale Hurston&rsquo;s WPA field recordings in Jacksonville, FL (1939),” </a> which includes three recordings created during the Works Project Administration (WPA) Federal Writers Project from 1937-1942 and made available online at the Library of Congress as part of the Florida Folklife Collections’ Florida Memory project. Zora Neale Hurston was an African American ethnographer, novelist, and dramatist, a collector, speaker, performer, and writer of other people’s stories and her own. In the 1930s alone, Hurston wrote numerous short stories, journal articles, books, and musicals based on her ethnographic field work in Alabama, the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia, Haiti, Jamaica, and New Orleans.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  These specific recordings of Hurston performing songs she had collected were created on June 18, 1939 in the WPA offices in Jacksonville, Florida under the direction of Herbert Halpert with Carita Doggett Corse and Stetson Kennedy. In order to make Hurston’s performances more accessible, the Florida Memory project extracted 21 moments when Hurston sings and talks from the longer recordings.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  In contrast to the Florida Memory abridged playlist, Clement’s scholarly edition is based on the full recordings and, consequently, facilitates listening to Hurston sing and talk within the context of the other songs, stories, and people recorded that day. Including stories shared by Beatrice Lange, which were told to her by the descendent of a rice plantation owner from South Georgia as well as Art Pages, the pianist for a Cuban band, and Rev. H. W. Stuckey of South Carolina, Buford County, the edition shows that listening to Hurston’s performances in context is important. As an African American woman and ethnographer from Florida, educated at Columbia University as well as in turpentine camps and juke joints in the Jim Crow South, Hurston played multiple roles in the WPA office as both collector and performer, as subject and object of inquiry, and as an authorized and unauthorized agent of the narrativization of African American folklore. The presentation of Hurston’s songs in the context of the other performances allows Clement to highlight conversations with Herbert Halpert, the white male lead and authorized collector as well as Carita Doggett Corse, Hurston’s white, female benefactor, and the songs and stories of the other performers, both white and Black, male and female, who provide a complex picture of the racialized and gendered endeavor that was folklore collecting in Florida in 1939.</p>
<p>The second example, <a href="https://kywark.github.io/example-sensitive-audio-lesson-syndicalism/"> “Example Sensitive Audio Lesson: John Beecher, McComb ‘Criminal Syndicalism’ Case,” </a> is a lesson plan on using sensitive archival materials in the classroom developed by Bethany Radcliff and Kylie Warkentin. Radcliff and Warkentin base the lesson plan around a 1964 recording of a Civil Rights activism event from the John and Barbara Beecher Collection at the Harry Ransom Center (HRC) at the University of Texas in Austin. On the HRC website, the recording had been made accessible without any trigger or other warnings. While this recording highlights the voices of community activists, it also includes racist slurs, descriptions of imprisonment of Black high schoolers, and testimonies from concerned parents. In an attempt to practice trauma-informed pedagogy and avoid replicating oppression, the authors use the apparatus that AWE provides to present this audio within a context that guides students and instructors in their approaches to the conversation. A Lesson Introduction and Overview for the instructor gives resources on trauma-informed pedagogy, an overview of how to create a GitHub account and AWE project, and a full lesson plan for engaging students in audio annotation and working with sensitive materials. The next sections, 1. Considering ‘Criminal Syndicalism’ Audio,  2. Analysis and Potential Annotation Routes, and 3. Further Analysis and Annotation in Groups, comprise different activities for students including providing an annotated, time-stamped version of a clip from the audio, marked with trigger warnings for sensitive sections, and activities to lead students through a collaborative process of critical analysis with audio using annotation. The final sections 4. Presentation and Extension Activity Using Hypothesis focus on using AudiAnnotate to present findings and introduce how to integrate Hypothes.is, a third-party web browser plug-in annotation tool that can be used with AWE projects to promote further discussion through collaborative annotation.</p>
<p>The third and fourth use case examples are graduate student essays that demonstrate how the AWE workflow works with video artifacts and how the process of annotation can shape scholarship.  “<a href="https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1/id/37">The Kindergarten Teacher</a>”  by Zoe Bursztajn-Illingworth is an investigation of poetic voice and address on screen in Sarah Colangelo’s film  <em>The Kindergarten Teacher</em>  (2018). The project shows that annotating scenes from the film shaped the author’s dissertation chapter,  “Right Voice, Wrong Body:  <em>The Kindergarten Teacher</em> , Poetic Address, and Voice as Possession.”  Through the process of annotation, the author observed how the film’s form reveals poetic voice as dialogic and public as opposed to a monologic, private utterance as lyric theory often proposes. In this multimedia essay, sections include scenes from the film with timestamped annotations alongside prose sections where the scenes are discussed further in the larger context of film and poetic theory.</p>
<p>The final use case example,  “<a href="https://jreinschmidt.github.io/camille-1921/">Camile 1921</a>”  by Janet Reinschmidt, includes annotations for the film  <em>Camille</em>  (1921) that the author used as part of a master&rsquo;s thesis on reception studies and queer interest in early Hollywood film. Again, this author provides access to  <em>Camille</em> <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  with annotations that mark key scenes of interest as well as a discussion of the influence that annotation had on their scholarship. During the annotation process, the author’s perception of silent and early sound film shifted as they re-watched scenes dozens of times for minute details easily overlooked by audiences. The author discusses how this process helped them reconsider the editing techniques and industrial shifts in film editing of a hundred years ago. This project also deploys Hypothes.is as a means to invite public comment. The author starts the public conversation through Hypothes.is by creating her own Hypothes.is annotations as examples, including notes on background information on lesbian cinema history and on the role of production collaborators for the filming of  <em>Camille</em> . For this author, the ability to facilitate and invite larger discussion around  <em>Camille</em>  means their project  “is as much about the preservation of these endangered silent films as it is about my thesis research”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These four projects (a scholarly edition, a lesson-plan, and two essays) show that increasing the use of AV in research and teaching — and therefore its preservation — is about more than just creating access.  <em>The State of Recorded Sound Preservation in the United States: A National Legacy at Risk in the Digital Age</em>  includes a survey of scholars whose work is primarily with audio and concluded that scholars wanted unfettered access and better discovery tools for deep listening or  “listening for content, in note, performance, mood, texture, and technology”   <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. The report also suggests that training for archivists and librarians in sound preservation must include critical listening skills <sup id="fnref3:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> because librarians and archivists need to know what scholars and students want to do with sound artifacts in order to make these collections more accessible. AWE facilitates such rich projects because it enables collaborative AV annotation and presentation through a minimalist computing workflow that depends on preexisting, free annotation software and on standardized web protocols the use of which is shared by free, community-rich platforms and tools such as GitHub and Hypothes.is. AWE is a sustainable and easy-to-use method that enhances how researchers and students are able to deploy scholarly primitives that, as the use cases show, go beyond annotation to include discovering, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and representing. Increasing the use of AV materials and their preservation requires facilitating the production of new knowledge in sustainable ways.</p>

<p>“Hey faggots,”  the hand-made poster shouts,  “if you’re going to call us trannies or transies, then we’ll call you stupid dicks and wee-wees&hellip;time for you to grow up”  (Fig. 1). Made by transsexual artists, sex workers, and activists Mirha-Soleil Ross and Xanthra Phillipa McKay for their 1990s zine  <em>gendertrash from hell</em> , the poster hilariously reproduces the cut-letter aesthetic of a ransom demand, using schoolyard argot to threaten “stupid dicks and wee-wees” while, at the same time, admonishing their faggot readers to “grow up.” The carefully cut-and-pasted magazine lettering references anonymity (the form uses mechanically printed lettering to shield the individualizing tell of the hand-written), as well as the circulation of media: demands such as this one show up ominously — in the movies anyway — in the target’s mailbox. Appearing in  <em>gendertrash</em> , Ross and McKay repurpose this older media form — the ransom note — as part of a zine, a paper DIY publication that circulated to trans activists and others in Canada, the U.S. and Europe in the 1990s. Now, our collaborative team transitions the media once more, from analogue to digital, as we digitize  <em>gendertrash</em>  for an open-source queer and trans community archive and digital exhibition. To borrow from Jessica Marie Johnson, we are recreating trans feeling in digital form: by gently releasing an artifact of trans femme becoming into a digital environment, this zine will become mediated through devices, metadata, likes, retweets, and a network of trans commenters, creating in the process an instance of trans femme digital practice.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This essay is about how ten diverse queer and trans DIY digital humanists, mostly students and all social justice oriented, created three digital exhibitions on queer and trans history, with accompanying podcasts, over the course of four weeks. Our project was based at The ArQuives, the largest independent LGBTQ+ community archive in the world, and the three projects focused on a wide range of Toronto-based queer and trans activist history:  “Not a Place on the Map: The Desh Pardesh Project,”  an oral history project about the queer South Asian diasporic arts and culture festival Desh Pardesh (1988 - 2001); the Foolscap Gay Oral History Project, a 1980s community-based oral history project of Toronto gay life pre-Stonewall; and  <em>gendertrash from hell</em> , the trans zine published by Ross and MacKay in the early 1990s. We worked together daily on a collaboration that brought together the LGBTQ Oral History Digital Collaboratory (the Collaboratory), a multi-year project on US and Canadian queer and trans oral history directed by Prof. Elspeth H. Brown; The ArQuives; the South Asian Visual Arts Centre (SAVAC); the University of Toronto; and York University.</p>
<p>Our collaboration emerges from the recognition that many gay and lesbian community archives founded in the 1970s are no longer necessarily outside the mainstream and, in fact, now benefit from varying forms of structural inequality. Projects like ours are necessary in intervening in the symbolic annihilation of trans and BIPOC people within the queer community archive <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. These gay and lesbian archives, radical in their time in many ways, are also bound up in histories of cisnormativity, whiteness, and settler colonialism; this history leaves a complex affective terrain that QTBIPOC activists-students-scholars must necessarily navigate as they encounter materials in the queer community archive. This work requires not only the labour of everyday DH praxis — digitizing, writing metadata, building exhibitions and podcasts — but also the affective labour of navigating the archival silences and information taxonomies built for documenting cis, white, gay and lesbian social movements. As Marika Cifor has argued, the turn to recognizing the distinctive affective experiences of LGBQT persons and collections within the archive can surface the specific needs of queer and trans people whose histories have been long-denied through processes of marginalization and non-recognition.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> While some of these affective encounters can produce a radical empathy as project members encounter materials that are personally meaningful, other encounters can produce more complex responses of disidentification and refusal <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We understood our work to be in dialogue with other scholars who bring questions of critical humanities scholarship to bear on digital praxis: projects that are motivated by questions of social transformation and radical politics.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  As an intergenerational, multi-institutional, queer, trans, and racially diverse gathering of DIY critical digital humanists, our work is an experiment in radical pedagogy that cuts across the institutional boundaries of both the liberal, LGBTQ+ community archive and the neoliberal university. Indeed, if part of the point of doing queer/trans digital histories is providing meaningful access to generational knowledge transfer, then involving undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, senior faculty, archivists, and community members as makers is key to expanding our understanding of cultural and political inheritance, both in terms of what histories, politics and cultures are remembered and what histories, politics, and cultures can be inherited.</p>
<p>Our thinking about the complex affective landscapes of DH praxis has been shaped by the concept of trans(affective)mediation, a term we borrow from Daniel C. Brouwer and Adela C. Licona to explore the relationship between anti-racist queer and trans studies, affect, and the collaborative potential of community-engaged DH. Brouwer and Licona rework the idea of transmediation — the transformation of one medium to another — to account for the  “affective stakes in the process of moving between print and digital”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Their work has focused on the affective terrain of both zine makers and zine readers, who experienced contradictory feelings of affirmation and loss as digital preservation intervened in zine culture’s attributes of immediacy, material vulnerability, and haptic intimacy. We have drawn from this work to consider the affective terrain of the queer, trans, and BIPOC DIY archivists who have engaged with QTBIPOC archival objects en route to building DH public humanities projects. Trans(affective)mediation, we argue, is a valuable tool for archival and DH activists whose project goals, like ours, seek to decenter whiteness, destabilize assumptions about ability, value horiztontal digital labour structures, and elevate the experiences of trans and nonbinary peoples of colour. In migrating media in this way, we consider transmedia as about both media and embodiment: trans studies asks us to consider trans as not simply about embodied histories, but also about movement and migration more broadly — in this particular case, the migration of media from analogue to digital. Our projects have addressed two forms of silences: the silencing of specific voices and experiences within the LGBTQ+ community archive and the erasure of marginalized, non-white community members who do the daily work of curating, maintaining, researching, analyzing, writing, digitizing, recording, and making within these archives <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. At the same time, this work has provoked mixed feelings. A methodology of trans(affective)mediation has enabled us to account for this contradictory emotional terrain as we both transform one medium into another and encounter both affirming archival objects and those that naturalize systemic inequalities based on race, gender expression, and ability. By documenting the processes that informed the mounting of these three projects, this article argues that through its call to focus and reflection in digital praxis and process, trans(affective)mediation offers queer and trans community-based DH scholars and practitioners a means of challenging the many ways that white cis-normativity becomes naturalized within both LGBTQ+ community archives and digital humanities tools and practices.</p>
<p>In what follows, we reflect upon and document the various methods, practices, and mediations that came together in the mounting of our three projects. Through trans(affective)mediation, we offer lessons learned, so to speak, the varying affective engagements that emerged, as well as a set of protocols for what we nonetheless believe is a radical, community-engaged vision of queer and trans-positive DH. The first portion of our article contextualizes our work with two sections on radical pedagogy and critical DH practice, as well as the challenges of  “inheriting [archival] data”  within radical DH work. The second portion of our essay delves more deeply into the specifics of the work we did together, including the ambivalences, frustrations, and utopian visions of intergenerational and inter-community solidarities which emerged. Following this, a section entitled  “Mapping Space and Time”  reflects on how digital explorations of spaces using the open-source GIS platform integrated with Omeka can spatialize histories of gentrification and colonization as they shape queer communities over time; in this section we reflect on the limits of our project for achieving the intersectional results we sought. The following section,  “Making Data,”  reports on our discussions and evolving practices around queering metadata description as a materialization of complex identity formations through the deceptively simple choices we make about tagging. Our final section,  “Trans(affective)mediation and Tactile Digital Histories,”  discusses the affective dimensions of working in  “analog”  archives in which our own racial, ethnic, sexual, or gender identities are implicated, and reflects and reports on both content and interface design choices we made in order to offer users of our digital collections potential entries into these experiences with the past. Drawing together the method, the making, and the digital materials that resulted, this essay argues for a trans(affective)medial vision of critical DH: an approach that is deeply reflective upon process; maintains a robust community-engaged praxis; and that challenges both DH and archival scholars alike to consider how normative forms of DH and archival making, maintenance, and curation enforce dominant structures of power.</p>
<h2 id="radical-pedagogy-intersectionality-and-critical-dh-protocols--praxis">Radical Pedagogy, Intersectionality, and Critical DH Protocols &amp; Praxis</h2>
<p>Radical pedagogy that values horizontal, shared leadership and open, democratic exchange is central to building a critical DH praxis that is socially just and meaningfully engaged in feminist, anti-racist, and anti-ableist perspectives. Early in our time together, we discussed our ethical commitments as a diverse collaboration of queer, trans, and non-binary scholars and activists, reflecting upon how we wanted these commitments to shape our digital methods, our practices, our project development, and our final outcomes. We wanted to develop what Anthony Bayani Rodriguez has described as a guerilla praxis, one that  “allows students to approach academic knowledge production as a public good and a form of social movement activism relevant to the material conditions of our times”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. These reflections proved central to developing a shared DH practice defined by 1) horizontal work relations and a meaningful division of labour, 2) drawing from DH’s roots in feminist pedagogy, a shared commitment to intersectionality, and 3) a recognition of critical disability studies’ important role in the development of socially just digital projects. We sought modes of DH protocol and practice (transmediation) that reflected our affective-ethical commitments as DH scholars and activists. As we argue here, these methodological commitments challenge underlying, normative assumptions in popular DH research and teaching projects.</p>
<p>In our case, we have followed a feminist pedagogy that is both anti-racist and trans centric, and which has brought together digital humanities praxis with community-engaged queer and trans history. As Jessica DeSpain has argued, digital humanities’ emphasis on experiment, making, and collaboration is deeply indebted to a longer history of feminist pedagogy, even though so much of recent digital humanities work occludes this history <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Feminist DH pedagogy foregrounds the goal of collaboration over hierarchy; designs the research environment so that a range of abilities are welcomed; examines the relationship between technology, media, and structural inequality as the work unfolds; and works closely with communities beyond the classroom. These feminist principles have been central to how many progressive digital humanists have understood their praxis, including our own, even if they are often dismissed for their DIY roots.</p>
<p>We designed our work together as a feminist, trans-positive and anti-racist intervention into DH and community archive projects. As Roopika Risam has argued, drawing on the work of legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, an intersectional approach — one that foregrounds the intersections of race, gender, and class in the analysis of structural inequality — allows digital humanities practitioners to overcome the field’s current divisions of making/programming vs. analysis and criticism <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Yet pursuing an intersectional approach within digital humanities projects is to work against the grain because, as Tara McPherson has argued, the difficulty in bringing together an analysis of race with an engagement with technology is  “an effect of the very designs of our technological systems, designs that emerged in post-WWII computational culture”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. We recognized that this seeming difficulty in bringing together race and technology is itself a problem of privilege. Scholars of color working at the intersections of media, technology and race, such as Anna Everett, Lisa Nakamura, Wendy Chun, Kara Keeling, Simone Browne, and Safiya Noble, among others, foreground questions of race and racism in the context of white supremacy, both within the academy and outside of it.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
<p>We have also approached our work together with insights drawn from Critical Disability Studies (CDS), a field of study that one of the students has particular expertise in. CDS examines why and how certain body-minds are deemed normal and natural, while others are not.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  The field challenged us to conjure up alternative material-discursive, labour, and digital spaces in which disability is both anticipated and desired. Disabled scholars and activists have long used digital tools to participate in humanities scholarship as their work has often been excluded from more traditional avenues of publication.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  Recently, digital humanities scholars have begun to consider the importance of building accessible digital tools and spaces as part an intersectional DH practice, rejecting a view of DH tools of the trade as neutral technological objects existing within complex power structures, rather than as technologies constituted through relations of power <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. Bringing digital humanities into conversation with disability studies pushes critically engaged digital humanities practitioners to reimagine the form of digital tools, work, and spaces. This commitment reminded us to contest digital tools which function only within a system of compulsory able-bodiedness and to welcome the difference in form our tools and projects will take when they are designed to embrace disability <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The questions raised by CDS very quickly reshaped our thinking. During our work together, we recognized the silences which an ableist model of digital space can enforce. As such, we took several steps to increase the accessibility of our three exhibitions. First, any audio materials in our collections were uploaded along with full transcripts. Second, we used ABBYY Finereader software to apply optical character recognition to all of the text-based archival materials in our collections. This allows the texts to be read by screen readers, a technology which reads texts out loud and is used by many people who are blind or low-vision. And third, we included image descriptions for any image based materials in our digital collections, and embedded alt-text for images whenever possible. We used these three accessibility tools as they applied to the particular needs of each collection.</p>
<h2 id="inheriting-data">Inheriting Data</h2>
<p>Working with archival collections, we soon recognized our three projects as a form of transmedial intergenerational cultural and political transfer and inheritance, and yet we also recognized how both the archival collections we selected and our group itself looked decidedly different from the kinds of white, cis, and heteronormative narratives which are often celebrated in LGBTQ+ community archival practice. The data we inherited, and the DH practices that we undertook, would have an uneasy relationship to where many of us understood our own position to be in LGBTQ+ history and life. We recognized these tricky encounters as precisely the kinds of trans(affective)mediations described by Brouwer and Licona. Where they documented the various affects that emerged when using queer ephemera that had been digitized, we sought to explore trans(affective)mediation through the process of digitization and mounting. Practically speaking, our projects drew on a range of analog and born-digital objects. In some cases, we digitized oral history interviews from cassette tapes that had not been listened to since the early 1980s. Other interviews conducted more recently came to us as digital audio, and in these cases, our digitizing work meant creating transcripts, abstracts, metadata, and streaming audio. Across all three projects, we accessed larger, paper-based archival collections to curate the exhibitions, choosing appropriate material to digitize and finding documents, images, photographs, and other ephemera that would bring these rich histories to life for users. We designed three creative exhibitions using Omeka and its Neatline plugin, an open source platform for digital collections designed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. All three exhibitions were accompanied by podcasts, specific to the content and process of collaborative, critical DH praxis. Our undergraduate participants curated the digital exhibitions and made the podcasts while more senior members of the lab provided mentorship, including scholarly and technical support. In addition to the podcasts, we also took turns creating reflective social media content (blogs for The ArQuives and the Collaboratory websites; Facebook, Twitter and Instagram posts) about our work in progress: a form of public-facing outreach to the communities we hoped to reach with our digital projects. To learn all of these technical processes, we came up with a series of workshops on topics such as writing abstracts, creating metadata, and using Omeka. We taught each other skills that were specific to particular collections, such as digitizing cassette tapes and records, or scanning photographs. In many cases we learned together. For example, Neatline was new to all of us, as was writing, recording, and producing podcasts. We sought support from the GitHub community when we were truly stumped by Neatline, and we reached out to the Queer Zine Archive Project, and a few DH librarians, via Twitter and Facebook when we wanted to learn best practices around document accessibility. Through these practices, all of us explored the wider, collaborative DH world.</p>
<p>All of our work together took place off-campus, in the second-floor gallery space of The ArQuives, Canada’s LGBTQ+ Archives. Founded in 1973, The ArQuives is primarily run by its 100+ volunteers, some of who have volunteered on a weekly basis for 40 years. As the largest independent and community-based LGBTQ+ archives in the world, The ArQuives houses records related to LGBTQ+ activism, art, and community life in Canada and around the world. The archives holds a significant periodicals collection, along with oral histories and other audio; film and video; books; banners and other textiles; a modest art collection; and other forms of ephemera crucial to queer world-making, such as pin-buttons and nightclub matchbooks. Building the archives’ trans collections has been a significant focus in recent years, through partnership with the Collaboratory. Like many other community archives, The ArQuives has invested heavily in developing digital infrastructures, as a way of doing outreach beyond the archives’ doors.</p>
<p>The ArQuives is an activist archive that documents social movements and activist campaigns for social justice <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Community archives like this one exploded in the 1970s, as activists in the civil rights, feminist, anti-war, and gay liberation movements sought to collect and preserve the records that emerged from these protests <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. This longer gay and lesbian history presents specific challenges to contemporary queer and trans archival activism, however. The ArQuives, like many 1970s gay organizations, was founded by a generation of gay, white, cis gendered men whose organization and activism helped end the criminalization of same-sex desire and who helped found keys institutions of gay and lesbian sociality, politics, and history during this period. It can be difficult for activist archivists, perhaps for some white gay men in particular, to understand how and why histories and methods imbricated with a heroic narrative of gay and lesbian sacrifice and struggle can, at the same time, be a site for the ongoing preservation of white, middle-class, cis values. Left unexamined, these embedded narratives, which shape decisions around collections and resource allocation, re-marginalize queer and trans people of color, Two-Spirit people, rural and poor members of the LGBTQ+ community, those who are disabled, and other marginalized groups <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Our collective work on these three collections, exhibitions, and podcasts — especially the Desh Pardesh and  <em>gendertrash</em> /Mirha-Soleil Ross projects — is part of a larger effort to shift The ArQuives towards a less exclusionary future. We conceptualized the digital exhibitions as a place where students, activists, and others can learn about our intersectional, queer, and trans past while at the same time learning about the The ArQuives and its extensive holdings.</p>
<p>As a team, we spent a lot of energy reflecting on how our critical ethical commitments should intersect with praxis and protocol. We are an intergenerational group with different relationships to the university, to gay and lesbian archives, and to the labor of making digital collections. Each of us contributed in significant ways to the intellectual design of the digital collections we worked on. At the same time, students expressed some frustration with the theory/praxis divide in DH and our projects, and reflected in their evaluations that as we progressed, more and more time was spent  “learning technologies and putting together the exhibits.”  As one student wrote in their evaluation, these technical tasks were  “challenging in and of themselves. But I definitely [think] we could have done more to make links — like how are power relations reproduced in the creation of metadata? How does our exhibition  trans-mediate  these materials?”  That students left the lab able to frame these kind of questions in relationship to the digital humanities is impressive, but it is also clear that the practical work of building digital collections, which is often repetitive or even mundane, overshadowed the theoretical outcomes we hoped for. This article is, in part, a way of bringing those threads together, to create that space and time.</p>
<p>Even as the data we inherited bore little resemblance to our own queer and trans lives, our team brought together faculty, community members, undergraduate, and graduate students into work models that emphasized collaboration, presence, and co-creation. As one student wrote in their evaluation of the lab,  “It was really great to have undergrads, graduate students, postdoc, and professors all in the room together learning from one another. I witnessed some really beautiful moments of mentorship, and to me this was an example of the way we can combat this individualistic [neoliberal] culture of academia in which we are told to consistently put ourselves and our careers first.”  Students noted that they chose projects they cared about because they aligned with their own interests or identity formations. At the same time, students expressed some frustration with working on three separate collections, instead of drawing connections across projects. As one student wrote,  “I also hoped that we would do more collaboration in the larger group of five rather than entirely working in the sub-groups. I had hoped there would be a bit more inter-group exchange. It was hard to facilitate that as we were short on time!”  This student’s critique of collaboration illuminates some of the problems that come along with grant or task based DH projects that pursue ambitious outcomes in short periods of time. Sometimes the work gets in the way.</p>
<p>Our group’s partnerships with community organizations such as The ArQuives and SAVAC exemplify how the digital has transformed the traditional learning space of the classroom, rendering students active participants and collaborators on research that can take new forms, as traditional research papers make room for digital exhibitions, Wikipedia articles, and other DH research outcomes <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. In some cases, as in our work together at The ArQuives, collaborative work takes place outside the classroom altogether. In moving outside the classroom to engage in digital humanities praxis, our work together unfolds in dialogue with community engaged scholarship, public history and public humanities, fields that have long sought to decenter the classroom as the sole site of learning about the past, especially in LGBTQ+ contexts.</p>
<h2 id="digital-mapping-space-and-time">Digital Mapping Space and Time</h2>
<p>In our work with the Foolscap Gay Oral History collection, we drew on digital mapping technologies to understand overlapping spatial histories of the city. Making maps allowed us to draw connections across Toronto’s queer communities, for example, by connecting gay men’s cruising spaces to histories of colonization. At the end of the project, we found that while these connections were often visible to us as makers, they did not necessarily come across for users of these discrete collections: our materials, research design, and tools did not always align in the ways we had hoped. Because we’d organized our work into three distinct projects based on the specific fonds we were working with, the original archival logics of separating whiteness from colonialism, for example, found their way into our mapping work. In our analysis of our collaborative work, we were reminded of how, as Jen Jack Gieseking has argued, GIS can reproduce the military logics of its origins as a technology. Like Gieseking, we felt this affective tension acutely. We found ourselves in need of  “new and easier-to-use technologies, algorithms, and tools”  that worked more effectiuvely against the grain of colonial logics <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>Mapping Foolscap</em>  is a digital exhibition that provides insights into the Toronto gay scene between the 1940s and late 1960s. The main primary source is a series of oral history interviews that John Grube and Lionel Collier conducted between 1981 and 1987, known as the  <em>Foolscap Oral History Project.</em>  The project produced over 100 interviews with Canadian gay men born in the first half of the twentieth century, who had spent most of their lives in Toronto. The respondents — mostly white, middle-class, and English-speaking — were part of Grube’s and Collier’s social circle, and ranged in age from 36 to 92. The interviews covered the respondents’ early lives, coming out experiences, initiations into the gay community, interpersonal relationships, sex lives, interactions with police or psychiatric therapy, contact with and opinions on the gay liberation movement, among other themes.</p>
<p>The authors’ digital exhibition,  “<a href="https://digitalexhibitions.arquives.ca/exhibits/show/mapping-foolscap">Mapping Foolscap</a>” , offers some of the digitized audio recordings and transcripts of the interviews, as well as an interactive map that locates the venues where gay men gathered, cruised, and socialized in pre-1970s Toronto. <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  The map locates popular movie theatres such as The Bay and The Rio; public spaces and cruising sites such as High Park, Allan Gardens, and Queen’s Park; bars and beverage rooms such as the King Cole Room in the Park Plaza Hotel, the King’s Plate Room in the King Edward Hotel, Letros, the Quest, and the St. Charles and the Parkside taverns. We supplemented the map entries with photographs and other graphic materials, as well as with audio clips from the interviews. Through these clips, the Foolscap narrators describe these spaces in their own words, or discuss their social and sexual interactions therein.  <em>Mapping Foolscap</em>  is in dialogue with the work of David Churchill, George Chauncey, John Grube, and other North American scholars, and seeks to provide a significant tool for researchers and the general public interested in Toronto’s gay history by facilitating the access to a rich, first-hand source that only a few people have heard about <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Foolscap Gay Oral History Project offers an astonishingly rich and detailed portrait of Toronto’s gay scene before Stonewall. Yet the project was far from intersectional: almost all of the 100 narrators are cis-gendered, gay white men, many of whom were middle class at the time of the interview. This does not accurately reflect the increasing diversity of Toronto’s gay community during the 1980s. These white interviewees are mostly silent on race, even though the mid-1980s was a heated political moment for building anti-racism in Toronto’s gay liberation community. <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  Despite this rich contemporaneous debate about race within the lesbian and gay community, the Foolscap interviewers did not pose questions to their narrators that would ask them to reflect on race, gender, and other markers of difference, and we were left to figure out how to map these erasures in the present <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To address such silences, contemporary activist and community historian Río Rodríguez, whose work is affiliated with the Marvellous Grounds project, has developed digital maps in collaboration with queer and trans Black, Indigenous and people of colour in Toronto. Rodríguez’s research in Mapping QTBIPOC Toronto demonstrates how GIS maps represent  “the city not as defined by history projects that intend to commemorate institutional success, nor as places that have a single history,”  but rather their maps value  “the multiplicity of voices that are often erased from understandings of public history due to racism, classism and transphobia”   <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. Rodríguez’ critical mapping work intervenes into dominant narrative of Toronto’s queer past, one that has privileged the life histories of white gay men and their activism, of which Foolscap is a part.</p>
<p>In visualizing the social geography of Toronto’s QTBIPOC histories, Rodríguez’ work dovetails with other critical DH projects that have brought an intersectional lens to understanding the history and politics of place. The FemTechNet’s  “Situated Knowledges Mapping Project,”  for example, explores how working with GIS systems can become a way for students to engage with these complex histories. Designed as a classroom activity, this project prompts students to become mapmakers, answering questions such as  “How are places racialized, gendered, classed, designated or felt as safe or dangerous? …What knowledges come from being part of a dominant culture in a place? And from a minoritized culture in a place?” . <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  Engagement with the politics of gentrification is common to DH mapping projects that draw on interviews and oral histories, and recent notable examples include Kristy Kang’s Seoul of Los Angeles: Contested Identities and Transnationalism in Immigrant Space, and the Bay-area based Anti-eviction Mapping Project <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p>DH has enabled public history projects to reach outside of the archive or museum to produce visitor itineraries that map onto the physical places within the city. Some of these spatial humanities approaches bring viewers and listeners, physically, into the urban environment through GPS-enabled mobile devices that provide digital access to localized  “tales of the city.” <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  Immersed in our critical DH work at The ArQuives, we pursued an  “old-school”  approach to learning about these histories: Rodríguez led us on an real-life  “Radical Queer Walking Tour”  shaped by their research for the GIS-enabled Mapping QTBIPOC Toronto project. With this tour, Rodríguez and their collaborators seek to displace white supremacist histories of Toronto’s Gay Village with stories focused on BIPOC activism, sex work, gentrification, and other ongoing struggles as they might be connected to the past. <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  The tour provided students with a model for translating their own critical engagements with lived space to the histories they were working on. Ideally, this intersectional approach to mapping Toronto’s queer and trans past would inform the curatorial approach to the students’ digital cultural mapping.</p>
<p>Rodríguez’s model enabled us to see new relationships between empire and sexuality as they came together in the physical space of the city. For example, as the Foolscap oral histories show, one of the city’s key spaces for gay cruising and public sex had been the bandstand located in (the appropriately named) Queen’s Park.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  But in 1969 the city dismantled the bandstand and installed, in its place, a five-ton equestrian statue of King Edward VII donated by the Indian government while  “in the process of getting rid of reminders of the days of British rule”   <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. Working with maps allowed us to understand how the landscape itself functioned as a material palimpsest for overlapping histories of both global and local structures of power: one concerning the histories of British imperialism, the Commonwealth, and the South Asian diaspora; the other concerning illicit sexualities in the space of the city.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  These overlapping histories were visible to us, as makers, to some extent, but the decision to keep the three digital collections separate renders these connections invisible to users. At the end of our project, we concluded that what had began as a division of labour aimed at getting as much done as possible over the course of the month reinscribed the original archival logics of each collection in digital space. We knew going into this project that the design of digital collections would impact how users learn about Toronto’s queer and history from the The ArQuives’s Digital Collections site; we didn’t realize until the end of the project that achieving the intersectionality we sought at a deep, technological level would have required us to think outside existing models for building archives and organizing work.</p>
<p>In our contributions to the The ArQuives’ digital exhibitions site, we decided to digitize collections that included histories of queer and trans people of colour, namely the Mirha Soleil Ross and Desh Pardesh collection. Because we organized our work around already existing collections, rather than a set of thematics that linked all of them, our research design maintains the liberal tokenism of adding QTBIPOC to the historical record <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. It was not until after the lab that we realized a critical trans(affective)mediation praxis could break the reproduction logics that often inundate digital archives with the same oppressive dynamics as their physical counterparts by imagining movements across separate collections. Trans(affective)mediation processes that use digital tools to draw thematic, spatial, and descriptive associations between apparently discrete historical moments or groups is one way digital archives might sort through these problems and challenge the grain of existing archival logics. <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p>
<p>How might we create new research designs that both accommodate the strategic essentialisms that are sometime useful at the level of pedagogy where, for example, students work on the projects that most closely match their identities while, at the same time, interrogating and complicating the stability of such identity categories? As one of the students who worked on the Foolscap collection wrote in their evaluation of the lab, while they felt ready to challenge the racism and misogyny built into the collection’s logic, they needed more interaction with their peers and mentors working on other collections in order to find the tools to do this. In retrospect we wonder what this experiment would look like if we had, instead, developed a project not around existing archival collections that were already organized by identity categories but instead had focused on a thematic that crossed these categories — queer arts organizing in Toronto in the 1980s and 90s, as one example. While our digital collections don’t begin from this kind of productive schema, our interventions in writing metadata achieved some success in using digital tools to undo some of the logics that govern (white) gay and lesbian archives. We explore this work in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="making-queer-and-trans-metadata">Making Queer and Trans Metadata</h2>
<p>Most digital collections depend on text-based descriptions, such as tagging objects by subject and keyword, in order to be search-retrievable, and ultimately intelligible and meaningful for the communities they represent. Yet standards practices in metadata description often fail to adequately index the complex histories, identities and embodiments contained within queer and trans cultural heritage materials. Standard subject heading vocabularies — databases of terms that creators can use to tag objects within a digital collection — sometimes use outdated or pejorative language to describe queer and trans subjects <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. Standard vocabularies oriented toward whiteness might not drill-down to the level of granularity required for the archives of queer diasporas. Queer and trans metadata initiatives such as the Homosaurus project, for example, assist in addressing the failures of descriptive standards for queer and trans cultural heritage materials by putting forward new, community generated standard vocabularies as linked data.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup></p>
<p>Doing community-based digital collections work from a queer, trans, and anti-racist perspective meant finding ways to revise standard, normative metadata vocabularies for our particular collections. We did this work with an understanding that queer and trans users have been some of the most adamant critics of metadata standards within the libraries and archives field. <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>  Our first workshop as a lab group focused on learning how to write metadata for oral history interviews on Omeka. As a group, we explored the political implications imbued in processes of making and revising data, weighing both the necessity and limitations of standard classification practices, and discussing the need to critique and demystify how databases are built <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. We found it necessary to improvise and bend some of rules that guide best practices in using controlled vocabularies <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. By talking about metadata, and practicing making data together, we oriented our work toward each of our political commitments and ideas about identity-based terminologies. As we added objects to our digital collections and came up against the inevitable compromises that invoking standards requires, we moved toward a more flexible understanding of description <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>. Our lab was an immersive experience in data as something that is made through small, singular acts that add up to larger infrastructures of intelligibility. While the Homosaurus worked well for The Foolscap and Mirha-Soleil Ross collections, digitizing the Desh Pardesh oral history project made us aware of the vocabulary’s 2017 limitations for describing the archives of queer of color diasporas. We discovered, for example, how LGBTQ+ metadata interventions such as Homosaurus had been organized around whiteness as a structuring logic.</p>
<p>The Desh Pardesh exhibition emerged as a metadata and curatorial collaboration between The ArQuives, the South Asian Visual Arts Centre (SAVAC), and the University of Toronto. Desh Pardesh (home away from home) was a groundbreaking multidisciplinary queer South Asian arts festival that operated in Toronto from 1988-2001. Bakirathi Mani has written that  “for the decade of its existence, Desh Pardesh was a monument to the possibility of creating diasporic communities that worked through national, linguistic, and religious differences in order to create a queer, anti-racist, and activist South Asian collectivity”   <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. Since its closure in 2001, the festival has become a relic for the Toronto South Asian arts community. While the festival has been sporadically commemorated with a few events, reflections, and critical essays over the past 15 years, there had yet to be any sustained investigation into this queer diasporic festival which took hold of the Canadian arts scene in the 1990s <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>. In part, this is due to the paucity of archival sources; as Gayathri Gopinath has argued, events such as Desh Pardesh often resist textualization because the  “queer spectatorial practice and the mercurial performances and more informal forms of sociality”  that occur at queer diasporic night clubs, festivals, and community events are not easily documented <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>. To address this archival silence, in 2013 Indu Vashist, SAVAC’s Executive Director, created  “Not a Place on the Map: The Desh Pardesh Project,”  a three-year oral history project about queer South Asian history in Toronto focused on Desh Pardesh. Hired in May 2014, SAVAC’s Anna Malla mobilized the festival’s networks to complete 36 oral interviews over two years. Coinciding with the month-long research lab, the accessioning of the Desh Pardesh research material at The ArQuives gave us the opportunity to tease out the complexities of writing metadata for archives of queer diasporic communities and lives. In using the Homosaurus to write metadata for the Desh Pardesh Project, we encountered many examples that show how whiteness as normativity is embedded within LGBTQ projects. Asian Cultures and Anti-racism drawn from the Homosaurus, for example, would only scrape the surface of this project’s descriptive needs. The team lamented that the Homosaurus could only tag queer South Asian dance practices that involved dance traditions such as Bharata Natyam or Giddha as exotic dancers, for example; they bristled at how distinctions between events and projects involving Tamil, Goan or Punjabi communities would be conflated into Asian Cultures,  Asian Religions or Asian Studies. Beyond its Anglophone commitment, the use of Asian as a cultural and racial referent exposes the Homosaurus’ Anglo-European roots. In wrestling with these limits, team members encounteresed and navigated what Brandon Walsh, drawing on Sianne Ngai, has described as the ugly feelings of failure as epistemology, where  “frustration and anxiety are central components of the classroom, not experiences to be delicately avoided”   <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. While we initially considered writing to create a new standard vocabulary for writing queer South Asian diasporic metadata, this proved far too ambitious for a month-long lab. In the end, we took a DIY approach, blending the Homosaurus with a modest, standard vocabulary that two members of our team generated out of listening to the oral history interviews, and considering the language used across narrators to describe queer and trans South Asian diasporic experience. Further considering the cultures-religions-studies triad used to complicate Asian in Homosaurus, we thought about the ways in which the practice of writing metadata in (white) LGBTQ archives has been historically marked and continues to be marked by Orientalist imaginations of the (Asian) Other. In the face of these LGBT archival practices, we opted to contextualize the project by writing into the digital collection an analysis of the further entrenchment of neoliberal governmentality in Ontario under the Mike Harris government of the 1990s. We hope that this reframing encourages alternative reading practices of this queer diasporic archive. Since taking over the Homosaurus, Rawson has been addressing critiques such as this one by working with collaborators to expand the vocabulary in key areas, such as slang, BDSM, Indigenous and Black terms; the Homosaurus welcomes collaborators in strengthening the project overall.</p>
<p>For the Mirha-Soleil Ross collection, another team created a page about their own relationships to identification and the terminology used in  <em>gendertrash</em>  to describe trans people and trans community. As K.J. Rawson has shown, digital humanities projects provide methodological tools for tracking shifting terminologies within trans communities across literary and cultural production. For Rawson, DH tools are entries to doing community-based etymologies, which matter for understanding the shifting cultural conditions in relation to which trans communities make themselves intelligible <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. In the  <em>gendertrash</em>   <a href="http://digitalcollections.clga.ca/exhibits/show/gendertrash/a-note-on-terminology">exhibition</a>’s  “A Note On Terminology,”  three team members identify, respectively, as a  “bisexual trans man, a queer cis femme, and a queer trans man”  who  “encounter  <em>gendertrash</em> ’s unusual terminology not merely as an historical artifact, but as a radical challenge to the way we understand identity, community, and attraction that remains just as relevant and necessary today.”  Narrating our own reading practices around identity labels and search terms makes more transparent the role of makers in community-driven databases, emphasizing our subjective investments in materials as a force that inevitably shapes how trans histories become intelligible in the present. Weaving these self reflexive discussions about terminology and its categorizing effects into our digital collections mirrors the care with which we have written metadata — with knowledge that these terms orient users to the histories they encounter. While tags and keyword classification often operate in the background of user’s search retrieval and navigation experiences, our outward reflections on description seek to bring these behind-the-scenes processes to the fore of the interface.</p>
<h2 id="transaffectivemediation-and-tactile-digital-histories">Trans(affective)mediation and Tactile Digital Histories</h2>
<p>Trans(affective)mediation was central to our deliberate engagement with remediation as an active, and often uncomfortable process that is an inevitable part of making digital objects from paper documents. As Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin have argued, remediation is a primary characteristic of digital media; digital media reproduce, adapt, or otherwise reference older forms <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. While remediation is a temporal phenomena that describes the relation between old and new media, the idea of transmediation explored by Henry Jenkins and others points to the difficulty of conceptually or technically sustaining divisions between media forms in the context of digital platforms. Techniques and aesthetics from print,  video, and the web productively converge <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>. Digital archives present a peculiar kind of transition across media in that they at once seek to promote and obscure the digital object’s status as reproduction. Online archives promise wide access to audiences who might not ever visit a brick-and-mortar archive and they do this, in part, by separating digital objects from their referents. On the other hand, digital archives are invested in creating experiences for users that are  “as good as the real thing,”  a promise that rests, in part, on denying the digital encounter’s status as substitute. Most members of our group are millennials accustomed to encountering queer and trans historical materials through platforms such as Instagram; for many of us, the lab presented a first encounter with archival research, and we learned basic practices in handling documents well, alongside some more critical introductions to archival arrangement. We were at once captivated by the aura of these objects and invested in their presentation in the age of digital reproduction, to paraphrase Walter Benjamin <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>. Playing with the relationship between digital objects and their analog originals was, for us, a purposeful practice. It became a significant focus when we considered selection, description and display, accessibility, but also the affective encounters we were staging for ourselves, and others.</p>
<p>Brouwer and Licona’s trans(affective)mediation is one way of marking the affective dimensions of digitized versions of queer, trans, and P.O.C. cultural heritage materials. Transmediation, which they define  “as the translation, or transformation, of one medium into another medium, a crossing over and a conversion of one already existing medium into another,”  is here marked with affective potentiality, as digitization may provide opportunities for distinct sensory possibilities <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>. Brouwer and Licona capture, in part, the ambivalence of digitization with this term, thinking through how online reproductions of queer, trans, and P.O.C. zines offer wider access and preservation, but also the loss of tactility, material records of use, and encounters with embodied others who are also readers <sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>  This ambivalent position guided our protocols for both collaboration and digitization, and we searched out ways of reproducing more meaningful encounters for users through experimentation with the Omeka platform, as we describe below. The anecdote about Mirha-Soleil Ross and Xanthra Phillippa MacKay’s  “Dicks and Weewees”  collage that opens this article gives a sense of how our work brought this attention to form, and the affective dimensions of working with paper zines, to bear on both digital collection design and encoding queer and trans life against the normativity of metadata.</p>
<p>Ross is a transsexual artist, activist, and sex worker best known for her video and performance art, her role as editor of the 1993-1995 zine  <em>gendertrash</em>  and as 1997-1999 organizer of Counting Past 2 – the first international trans film festival in Canada. Her sizable personal fonds at The ArQuives consists of books, periodicals, videos, physical artifacts, correspondence, working papers, and periodical clippings that represent not only her own work and interests as a collector, but also material traces of the collaborative and more broadly social aspects of much of her work. The  <em>gendertrash</em>  series that became the focus of our digital collection contains a large amount of correspondence with retailers, subscribers (including prisoners who received the zine for free), and hopeful or successful contributors — as well as draft manuscripts, clip art, zine pasteups, and financial documents. The correspondence, more than anything else, demonstrates how much Ross’s practice built upon networks of trans activists, artists, and publishers across North America and Europe who supported each other by the transnational exchange of information, social connections, subscriptions and advertising space, despite a lack of complete consensus around issues like sex work, prison reform, medico legal gatekeeping, and activist strategies. Our digital collection sought to reproduce, or at least gesture toward these networks in some way, building upon Brouwer and Licona’s assertion that digitized zines ought to be understood and experienced within extensive, complex networks that reproduce but also depart from paper circulation methods <sup id="fnref3:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As part of this project, Ross gave archives volunteers permission to digitize and share all issues of  <em>gendertrash</em>  online. Previously, only the first issue, edited by Xanthra Phillips, had been accessible online (through the Queer Zine Archive Project). <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>  In itself, the periodical represents an aesthetically and historically significant assemblage of news, resource listings, art, and commentary, tied together by the radical queer politics of Ross and her partner/collaborator Xanthra Mackay. In addition to our use of ABBYY to make  <em>gendertrash</em>  scans compatible with screen readers, we were also motivated by questions of accessibility in deciding what material to make public; we wanted to provide a scholarly rigorous discussion of  <em>gendertrash</em> ’s historical context that would be compelling for a broad public while providing easier access to important related objects from the Ross fonds. Our team felt this would align our digital presentation of  <em>gendertrash</em>  more with the claimed purpose of the original  <em>gendertrash</em>  :  “giv[ing] a voice to gender queers, who’ve been discouraged from speaking out &amp; communicating with each other”   <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As we were attempting to digitally publish our Omeka exhibit, we had some difficulty finding materials to share that wouldn’t require lengthy consultations around privacy and rights (i.e. correspondence).<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>  We ultimately decided to begin with a small exhibit centered around images of the original artwork and paste-ups used to produce the zines, and activist buttons (made by Ross and Mackay) that could be ordered through forms published in  <em>gendertrash</em>  and other trans periodicals. We furthermore uploaded a modified version of one of these order forms to the Neatline plugin for Omeka, and made it so that clicking on individual issues or buttons on the form would allow online visitors to access the digitized zines and buttons (Fig. 2). The small selection of objects in the exhibit are eye-catching and representative of the politics of the zine overall while the Neatline navigation serves as a reminder of the way a single print artifact may have been able to serve as a material link for isolated trans people to connect both with a wider community and also with a larger body of trans material culture.</p>

<p>This order form uses simple image-mapping technologies built into the Neatline plugin in order to remediate the affective experience of receiving, completing, and mailing a paper order form, for born digital users who may never have had to send away for a publication this way. As Brouwer and Licona, but also Kate Eichhorn and Jenna Freedman, have all argued, tactility, records of wear, use, of making, reading, and photocopying together, or for others, are fundamental to the status of zines as media <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>. Recreating this order form online reproduces the experience of touching, choosing, sifting and sorting within a digital interfaces, or at the very least, shows users that this experience might have taken place by organizing the collection around the pre-printed form as a media infrastructure of engagement. These are affective gestures that form part of what it means to participate in trans material cultures.</p>
<p>Like our reflections on making data, a critical transmediation practice required us to insert our own processes of encountering the originals in the stories we told to users about making these digital collections. To launch and contextualize each collection, we produced podcasts, through a workshop format lead by Stacey Copeland, a feminist podcast-maker, radio host, and doctoral candidate at Simon Fraser University. As Hannah McGreggor argues, learning podcasting develops technical skills from which queer, trans, and racialized communities, outsiders to normative representations of maker cultures, are often excluded. Podcasting is not actually that difficult, technically speaking, and allows students to engage with processes of making that enrich humanities education and provides opportunities for self-expression. In each of these podcasts, students found ways to place themselves within the stories they told about making digital collections.</p>
<p>For the  <em>gendertrash</em>  podcast, two team members narrated the process of unboxing some of the Ross fonds in real-time, in a recording that captures the excitement that comes along with touching trans historical documents for the first time. They digitized selections from Ross’s collection, in order to include audio from Vaginal Davis and Robespierre’s 1994 punk anthem,  <em>Queens (Make the World Go Round)</em> , situating their unboxing processes in an immersive engagement with what Ross’ acoustic environment might have been like while making  <em>gendertrash</em>   <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>. Mapping of the Foolscap interviews led another set of team members to understand the importance of space for gay men in a transnational context, as one of the grad students revisited his own memories of these geographies in Mexico City. Their podcast edited original interview clips in ways that brought stories of being in these spaces to life, for example, adding the sounds of a summer thunderstorm to a clip in which a narrator describes seeking shelter from the rain in a bandstand with another man who would quickly become a lover. Two members of the team described what it felt like being brown and queer and encountering these records of a history in which you might locate yourself. As one of our group described it in their podcast,  “I wish that a community as large and as strong as Desh still existed. What amazes me is that in 2017, I don’t feel the same sense of empowerment as Natasha. With Desh, people weren’t alone, and had the space to explore their identity within the safety of a group that feels the same way.”  Through these podcast stories, creating queer, trans, and P.O.C.-centred digital collections became precisely about critical forms of inheritance, finding an explicitly queer, trans, brown, or anti-racist history of the city that mirror experiences today, while recognizing differences that matter.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our experiments with trans(affective)mediation techniques drew on critical approaches to digital mapping, writing queer and trans metadata, and building online interfaces in order to offer users engagements with the past that were also engagements with how digital collections get made. Our work together and our reflections on collaboration brought forward some challenges, which will shape our work in the future. As we have suggested here, while aspects of our research design limited the ability of our finished collections to fully realize the anti-racist, intersectional approach to queer and trans history we aimed for, we believe our approach offers critical DH practitioners many entries to thinking about digital archives and the labouring conditions that shape how queer and trans scholars, students, and activists do research together. Our work is one instance of how social justice-engaged university researchers from all stages of academic life can collaborate with community groups to produce digital collections that transmediate our relationships to the past: this aspirational process draws connections across communities of struggle by breaking down more rigid archival logics; it can re-write the database forms and standards used to describe and mediate access to collections; and in turn, can offer ways to re create the tactile and affective dimensions of touching queer and trans histories.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<p>Big data opens a window onto the global dimensions of our cultural heritage and history <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The availability of large datasets of digitized newspapers offers unprecedented opportunities to explore the transnational and intercultural connections of the western world. This article explores the ways in which word vector models can be used to analyse how the exchange of knowledge, ideas, and concepts across borders and languages is reflected in newspapers. It focuses on the period of globalization between the middle of the nineteenth century and the return to isolationism and nationalism in the wake of the First World War.</p>
<p>This publication is based on a strand of the international research project  “Oceanic Exchanges: Tracing Global Information Networks in Historical Newspaper Repositories, 1840–1914”  (OcEx). OcEx has brought together an international and interdisciplinary research consortium to examine patterns of information flow across national and linguistic boundaries in nineteenth-century newspapers by linking digitized newspaper corpora currently siloed in national collections. Funded by the Trans-Atlantic Platform for the Social Science and Humanities’  “Digging Into Data Challenge,”  this effort builds on the recent rediscovery of global and world history to overcome the national perspectives of the past.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The larger academic research question this article addresses is how we can trace the migration of concepts over time and across space. Specifically, this article discusses two sets of very different concepts which changed during the second half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century. The first is the set of concepts that denotes the most public aspects of human existence: the collective identity that is framed in terms of nation,  state,  people, and national identity. The analysis of this category of concepts also allows comparison with traditional approaches to conceptual history, as discussed below. The second, in contrast, deals with the ultimate personal experience reflected in discourses about illness and health. Although belonging to a different domain than national identity, illness and health likewise reflect fundamental experiences in human life which can reach collective dimensions, as in the case of epidemics and pandemics. More importantly, the concepts that people in different nations and cultures have employed to understand and respond to these circumstances of well-being or illness are conditioned, or mediated, by shared ideas about the human condition which have changed over time. Both national identity and health, then, are cultural constructions which should be understood in their historical and geographical context. These conceptual sets are interesting use cases because there is already a rich body of academic literature that suggests important changes in the understanding of both nation and illness as labels for abstract ideas and knowledge domains took place during this period <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How can we use computational word vector models to identify the changing vocabulary in which concepts are expressed? While many definitions of concepts circulate in various academic disciplines such as linguistics, philosophy, and psychology, no consensus has emerged <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Within this article, we define a concept rather pragmatically as a key term or core idea that has been used in historical discourse, and as an abstraction or mental representation that has served as a building block for thoughts and beliefs. We approach historical concepts not as analytical research tools constructed by historians to understand the past, but rather as the mental constructions of actual historical actors as they are expressed in formal and informal public discourse, political tracts, fiction, or life writing. We focus on historical newspapers as a serial and coherently structured source to demonstrate how such concepts are articulated <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The significant contribution this article presents is to demonstrate how word vector models can be used on different newspaper collections in different languages to explore the way concepts have shifted in meaning, as they migrated, between 1840 and 1914. Rather than attempting a comprehensive overview of conceptual history in this period, the aim of this article is to demonstrate the viability of this methodology and the significance of newspapers as representatives of the public sphere <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. This computational approach to conceptual history opens up new ways to identify patterns in public discourse over longer periods of time and across borders. We also contribute to the discussion about the relationship between concepts and natural language in the larger process of knowledge discovery <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="2-conceptual-change-and-word-vector-models">2. Conceptual change and word vector models</h2>
<p>Historical concepts are essential to our understanding of the past <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Concepts such as citizenship, democracy, migration, liberty, security, trust, and health constitute the continuous foundation of changing historical debates and have been compared to the  “unit-ideas”  that form the building blocks of human discourse, similar to the elements that form chemical compounds <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Tracing the change, continuity, and replacement of these concepts is vital for historians and other humanities scholars, since concepts are the lenses through which people in the past understood the world.</p>
<p>Our approach builds on the tradition of conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte), as established by the Bielefeld school of Reinhart Koselleck and the Cambridge School associated with J. G. A. Pocock and Quentin Skinner. Koselleck argues key terms such as nation, citizenship, and family reflected fundamental changes in the social and political structures of European societies which took place from the mid-eighteenth century onwards. The magnum opus of eight volumes, which he edited together with Otto Brunner and Werner Conze, traces the shifting meaning of one hundred and thirty of these leading concepts (Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe). These concepts reflect modernity, and social and political change <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. The methodological question this article addresses is whether computational methods can identify the fundamental changes in vocabulary that demonstrate the kind of conceptual change Koselleck’s group describes <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Bielefeld group is often contrasted with the conceptual history tradition established in the United Kingdom. The Cambridge School of Intellectual History established by Pocock and Skinner is interested in the inherent historical contextuality of conceptual change. Their work contributed to a shift from a history of ideas to a history of concepts, and pushes against any sense of keyword definitions  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Skinner’s work on concepts such as the state and liberty has been key to the development of conceptual history as a field. Pocock’s study of the key ideas of  “Machiavellian thought,”  which moved from Renaissance Italy to Civil War Britain and then crossed the Atlantic to inform the American Revolution, suggests an interconnectedness of concepts across linguistic and geographical boundaries <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Building on these German and British research initiatives, and related projects in Scandinavia, the Netherlands and elsewhere, conceptual history became an established – if undertheorized – field in the 1970s, producing a number of monumental studies that have been described as a true  “pyramid of the mind”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Conceptual drift – the historical shift in the meaning of concepts and the words that articulate them – has mainly been analyzed chronologically in the context of a single language <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. De Bolla demonstrates how keyword search methods can be used to trace how the concept of human rights developed during the era of the American Revolution <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Little has been done to study the way in which concepts change if they are translated into different languages and cultural contexts. Studying  “what happens when concepts move between different kinds of modernities and their associated temporalities”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> remains one of the unsolved challenges in the history of concepts, and is thus key to the methodology of this article. A better understanding of conceptual migration is essential if we want to know how news, knowledge, ideas and ideologies circulated in the globalizing world that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century, how nations emerged as imagined communities around common newspaper readership, or how people in various parts of the world learned about and gave meaning to pandemics diseases and disasters.</p>
<p>In recent years, word vector models have been used to represent concepts in text corpora. Rather than relating words to objects or events in the real world, word vectors represent a multidimensional network of relations between words in a large textual corpus. Word vectors are representations based on the distributional hypothesis, which assumes that words tend to be similar if they occur in a similar context. The meaning of words is represented by the relative positions of their vectors in that semantic space. The effectiveness of this associative approach to identifying concepts has been demonstrated <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> and applied to the scientific discourse of the seventeenth century; <a href="#pumfrey2012">Pumfrey, Rayson and Mariani (2012)</a> have conducted significant work that compares a manual approach to a digital humanities methodology using corpus linguistics tools.</p>
<p>Related approaches have also been proposed in the computational linguistic community. However, most approaches target a change of word senses, i.e. the different meanings a word can have, rather than concepts. In distributional semantic models (based on the distributional hypothesis by Harris) a word is defined by the context in which it appears <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. This notion became popularized as the idea that  “You shall know a word by the company it keeps!”   <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. Such representations are used to show that word senses change over time. Distributional thesauri have been used, for instance, to compute word similarities for different time points in Google Books data <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. Computing different embedding representations for several time spans can show how word sense changes over time <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. This unsupervised computational methodology demonstrates how new senses are born, disappear, or remain consistent. By aligning the embeddings of different time spans in the same vector space, it has been possible to demonstrate how terms change position over time in the vector space.</p>
<p>The use of word vectors models received a boost by the word2vec algorithm developed by Google. Using a large corpus of text as input, this algorithm offers an efficient and reliable method to produce a multi-dimensional vector space, in which words that share common contexts in the corpus are located close to each other <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. As Word2vec can place words from a large text corpus such as books, web pages or newspaper articles in a vector space that represents semantic similarity it can indicate, or  “predict,”  semantic relations between words <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Yet most corpus-based distributional semantic methods use a bag-of-words approach that lumps words together without taking their temporal order or historical origin into account, assuming that the meaning of words remains stable over time. As such, the challenge remains finding a computational approach that accounts for both the historicity of changing word meanings and also conceptual change.</p>
<h2 id="3-computational-methodology">3. Computational methodology</h2>
<p>In this article, concepts are hypothesized as semantic spaces within a vector space in which vocabularies can be identified that express core ideas, abstractions or mental representations. We operationalize this by following conceptual change in different regions of the western world, tested computationally by comparing the changing vocabularies in word vector spaces of a number of concepts with a global presence, and then interpreting them with specific domain knowledge.</p>
<p>A methodology has recently been developed to use word vector models, created with the word2vec algorithm, to interrogate historical changes in vocabularies linked to concepts. The digital history team at Utrecht University, in collaboration with the Netherlands eScience Center, has developed the tool ShiCo (Mining Shifting Concepts through Time) which enables researchers to test this methodology on collections of digitized newspapers <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. This tool creates word vector models of ten years each, with an overlap of two years, e.g. 1840–49, 1842–51, 1844–53. When users enter one or more search terms (or seed words), the algorithm will return the vocabularies found in the surrounding vector space for each model. This offers an overview of gradual changes over time in vocabularies associated with the concepts <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We use ShiCo as a backend to access the embeddings of all corpora used in this study. <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  In adaptive mode ShiCo is able to use the vocabularies that are found in a vector model as seed words for the next model, as a way to trace gradual concept shift. We used the non-adaptive mode to trace the changing vocabularies associated with the same seed words over time, in order to create a more stable baseline from which to compare vocabularies from different language corpora in the same time period. For the generation of the word embeddings, we deploy gensim and compute CBOW models, with 100 dimensions, a window size of five, a minimum word count of five, and with five negative samples. <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup></p>
<p>In our study, we compute similarities for a term for each window of time as set in the interface, using the same seed words. Since the windows of time overlap, most of the semantic relations between words remain stable, resulting in gradual changes over the years. We argue that this method offers a way to understand gradually-changing words that are used to articulate the same topic, concept, or idea. One can debate to what extent these semantic spaces in a word vector model represent historical concepts <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>. This article tests this hypothesis by employing ShiCo on several different digitized newspaper collections.</p>
<p>Due to OCR issues with historical newspapers, particularly issues arising from the similarity of some characters, our corpora have large amounts of words with erroneous variations. Furthermore, the fraktur font is used in historical German-language newspapers, and the OCR models deployed to convert German-language newspapers are not trained on such a font. For example, the term Krankheit (illness) is also similar to the writing variations Krankbeit, Krankhcit, Kraiikheit, Kraukheit. To solve this issue, we merge variations with manual correction lists (e.g. Krankheit: Krankbeit, Krankhcit, Kaiikheit, Kaukheit) and use the mean of all similarity scores as the similarity score.</p>
<h2 id="4-a-multilingual-dataset-of-digital-newspaper-corpora">4. A multilingual dataset of digital newspaper corpora</h2>
<p>We deploy parallel instances of the ShiCo software to create word vector models for the newspaper corpora we use as datasets (<a href="https://oceanicexchanges.org/news/">https://oceanicexchanges.org/news/</a>). We use eight different corpora including four different languages, namely English, German, Finnish and Swedish (Table 1). These corpora were selected because they represent large national newspapers collections which can be compared to gain an understanding of the transnational and cross-cultural circulation of knowledge and ideas, as was the starting point of the  “Oceanic Exchanges”  project, and on the basis of their availability in digitized form with sufficient OCR reliability <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. The date range 1840–1914 was selected to capture a the period of rapidly expanding cross-Atlantic trade, traffic, migration, and cultural exchange which can be understood as the first wave of globalization. This period was also the heyday of newspapers as the first big data for a mass audience <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>.</p>
<p><em>The Times Digital Archive</em>  (TDA) was the first online digitized newspaper collection of British newspapers. Currently, it contains material up to 2010 comprising over 1.6 million pages from 70,000 issues of  <em>The Times of London</em> , sub-divided or zoned into 11.8 million articles, catalogued by category, including advertising, editorial and commentary, news, business, news, people and photojournalism. The data for the digitized newspapers comes in two forms: a scanned image of each newspaper page at 300 DPI, zoned and sub-divided at article level, and an XML file containing the text (OCR) and metadata for each article. The machine-readable text appears within the XML file, surrounded by metadata that describes various features about the article, including the title, issue, date, section, and page number. The collection is available in many state and institutional libraries throughout the world through a commercial licencing arrangement with Gale. The underlying text and metadata can be accessed by request, with a cost recovery fee. <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>
<p>The Finnish newspaper corpus has been provided by the National Library of Finland and is downloadable as a data dump via the Language Bank of Finland. The collection includes all published issues from the birth of newspaper publishing in the country in 1771 up to 1920. Since the Finnish press has mainly been published in two languages, Swedish (SE-NLF) and Finnish (FI-NLF), we compute two models on newspapers from 1840 to 1914. Within this timeframe 369 different titles were published, totalling 3.6 million pages: 26% in Swedish, 74% in Finnish. In the corpus, the amount of data in Finnish is especially thin in the 1840s and 1850s as the Finnish-language press only expanded towards the end of the century. By 1890, 47% of all published newspaper pages were still in Swedish. The Finnish-language press was furthermore printed mostly with Gothic typeset, which results in a substantial amount of OCR noise.</p>
<p>To investigate the shift of concepts in German-language newspapers, we compute embeddings for three different corpora: the German parts of the  <em>Europeana</em>  (DE-EU) corpus, the German-language newspapers from  _Chronicling America _ (DE-CA) and the  <em>Berlin State Library</em>  (DE-SBB) corpus.</p>
<p>The  <em>Europeana</em>  corpus<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  is a collection of 50 million digitized items such as books, newspapers, music and artworks that have been published in Europe. From these items, there are 876,724 newspapers available which have been digitized and OCRed. The majority of pages written in German are from Austria (1,184,091), followed by Germany (822,085), Italy (683,062), Estonia (39,540) and Lithuania (27,030). This corpus comprises 129 different newspapers from 1840 to 1913, 6,272.3 million tokens, and around 494.8 million words. The number of tokens indicates the words in a corpus regardless of how often they are repeated, while the word count reflects the number of distinct word types.</p>
<p><em>Chronicling America</em>  is a web-based platform that gives access to newspapers published in the United States from 1789 to 1963, with descriptive information about the newspapers and digitization of historic pages.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  The majority of newspapers fall within the range 1850–1922. In addition to American titles published in English, it also includes newspapers of twenty ethnicities such as, for instance, Native American, Czech, Swedish, Icelandic, Danish, Finnish, French, German, or Italian. We use newspapers that were published in German (DE-CA) between 1840 and 1913. This collection consists of 57 newspaper magazines, resulting in a corpus of 929.8 million tokens and 49.5 million words.</p>
<p>The newspaper corpus from the Berlin State Library (DE-SBB) is a collection of historical newspapers published in the German states. We selected newspapers from 1872 to 1913, which is a corpus of 3,111.6 million tokens and 119.8 million words. Compared to the previous two corpora, this corpus is very specific according to its locations, as it contains only articles from three newspaper publishing houses in Berlin.<br>

<h2 id="5-case-study-i-nations-and-national-identity">5. Case study I: Nations and national identity</h2>
<p>The nineteenth century was, in many respects, the age of nationalism and national identity. Although new nation states produced long genealogies of invented history that suggested perennial antecedents in tradition, common language, and ethnic affiliation, those were relatively new constructs cobbled together out of the regional and tribal identities of the ancien régime. Modern nation states were very much the product of modernization and industrialization, processes which required unification of time, language, education, and collective behaviour, political emancipation and mobilization of the middle classes, and the integration of the new urban masses. Rather than emerging from natural, perennial, or  “primordial”  identities, nations were deliberately based on  “constructed”  ideas of national identity <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Several authors have indicated the importance of newspapers and other mass media in the formation of these new national identities <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. If the nineteenth century was the age of national identity, it was also the age of newspapers, magazines, journals, and the book industry. As the many local newspapers fostered urban and regional identities, the new national newspapers connected and informed the rapidly emerging readership of wealthy middle-class citizens. Anderson demonstrates that modern mass media played a vital role in the formation of these  “imagined communities,”  as they created collective illusions of shared experience, group solidarity, and common fate <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. National identity and the emergence of capitalist media appear, therefore, to be interconnected. At the same time, the growing global information networks of the nineteenth century increasingly allowed national newspapers to inform their readers about developments in the world. These newspapers not only provided factual news about government decisions, political upheavals, military expeditions, trade opportunities, or new inventions, but also constructed political ideologies and movements.</p>
<p>Conceptual history has produced impressive studies to trace the emergence of the new concepts of nation, nationalism, and the people. A large section of  <em>Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe</em>  ( <em>GGB</em> , 1972–97) is dedicated to the emergence of the related concepts  “Volk, Nation, Nationalismus, Masse”  in German discourse <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Although this  <em>GGB</em>  chapter traces the concept from antiquity to the end of the Cold War, the main conceptual turning point can be traced to the period from the second half of the nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, when the nation became the focus of political mobilization. Conservative, liberal, Catholic, and socialist movements developed their own political and social lexicons to express their ideas about national identity. The concept of ”nation” thus became a synonym for social integration. As Koselleck hypothesizes, the German word Volk (people) remained a concept (Begriff) with a mainly state-centred and political meaning, whereas the loanword Nation (nation) was largely apolitical. With the rise of the working-class movement during the second half of the century, the concept of the nation became gradually connected with the democratic participation of the masses reflected in references to terms such as proletariat, masses, and mob (Proletariat, Masse, and Menge) <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This case study aims to trace such conceptual changes in large datasets of digitized newspapers repositories, to explore how the development of national discourse unfolded in different European countries and across the Atlantic. The objective is to address the question of whether the emergence of national discourse can be seen as a universal and uniform phenomenon in the western world, or rather whether national traditions can be discerned as they are reflected in the vocabulary used to express the concept of the nation. In other words, by using word vector models, the analysis will shed light on the way in which newspapers invented national communities and created shared national experiences. What conceptual changes emerge in the public debates in the different countries around this discursive topic?</p>
<p>In this experiment, we compare the changing vocabulary around the concept of nation by implementing word vector modelling on national newspaper corpora in different languages in the period 1840–1914. Word vector models were used for newspapers published in English, Swedish, Finnish, and German, as published in the UK, Finland, Germany, and the US.</p>
<p>As entry points into the semantic vector space (seed words), we use different synonyms for the term nation derived from the  <em>GGB</em>  and the secondary literature, to which we add the terms that resulted from the word vector modelling.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  To compare the changing vocabulary and improve readability, we use the (modern) English translations of these terms as anchor points.</p>
<h2 id="a-the-transnational-migration-of-national-identity">A. The transnational migration of national identity</h2>
<p>The term nation derives from the Latin word nationem for birth, origin, or tribe. The geographical concept of the nation is thus firmly established, and is still evident in the 1840–1914. Ironically, the conceptual stability of nation in public discourse seems more stable than the geopolitical realities of the time. Within the word vector space of TDA, the search term England, for example, produced a stable set of names of other nations; England shares a semantic space with Scotland,  Ireland,  France, and Belgium, and also with America. Perhaps more remarkably, the term Europe is also part of that stable presence. Germany and Spain are mentioned in 1848, as the political revolutions in both countries inject them into public discourse, and ensure they persist after (see Table 2 below).<br>

The Finnish dataset FI-NLF shows a sense of Nordic insularity, as all the proper names of nation states are from Nordic countries: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark (Suomi, Ruotsi, Norja, Tanska). In Finnish there is a distinction between Suomi (Finland) and suomi (Finnish language), but it is lost here because the word embeddings are not case sensitive. Therefore, many word vectors are also related to the Finnish language (like suomenkieli, opetuskielenä, kieli, suomenkielinen). Historia (history) and Pohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia, a region in Finland) are also included, but references to other European nations or to the concept of Europe are remarkably absent in the Finnish word vector space of Nordic countries.<br>

This semantic stability may be seen as an illustration of the fact that the nation states are defined in relation to each other, as Koselleck observes <sup id="fnref1:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>. The relative stability in the word vector models stands in sharp contrast to the geopolitical upheavals of this period. The First World War, for instance, is virtually invisible in the long-term representation of the word vector models.</p>
<p>The shifting vocabularies in which the concept of the nation is expressed in public discourse, have changed over time considerably. Although references to the nation appear in all European countries during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the semantic associations reflect the different contexts in which this concept functions. In TDA, the semantic connection between the term nation and monarchy, which is initially very strong, disappears after 1884. The nation is consistently associated with people over the full period under review, reflecting the broad meaning of the word in which national identity is based on the notion of a people sharing similar language and ethnic origins. Unsurprisingly, nation is also associated with the term empire in England, although this connection weakens after 1908 (see Table 5).<br>

A narrower political interpretation of national identity appears only in the 1860s in TDA, when nationalism became associated with conservatism, but also with the competing political affiliations of liberalism, democracy, and Toryism. The growing political awareness and polarization in the 1870s is reflected by the connection between nationalism and the term radicalism within the same word vector space. That nationalism is also placed in a religious context is suggested by the emergence of religious terms such as protestantism,  clericalism, and ultramontane (the latter reflecting the political ambitions of the pope). The role of the state is difficult to assess on the basis of the word vector models because the word state possesses several meanings in English. Yet the term state seems associated with the more administrative terms to govern,  government, and administration from the 1840s on, and the more negative term disorganisation from the mid-1850s on, hinting at a tendency perhaps, to describe the state, rather than the nation, in utilitarian terms.<br>

After German unification in 1871, the newspapers reflected the strong cultural origins of the German sense of national identity. The term nation is strongly associated with christianity (Christenheit) in the 1870s, the period marked by Bismarck’s cultural war (Kulturkampf) against Catholicism. Although the Iron Chancellor faced defeat in the political arena, the emergence of the secular alternative civilization (Zivilization) in the 1880s suggests that he won in public discourse. This seems to confirm Koselleck’s conclusion that the German sense of nation is primarily a cultural construct (Kulturbegriff). Nevertheless, the word vector models also show the connection with power. The emergence of geopolitical and military terms such as sea power,  great power, and world power (Seemacht, Großmacht, Weltmacht) in the vocabulary around the term nation reflects Germany’s global geopolitical ambitions, which were translated into colonial expansion and maritime muscle-flexing at that time. A similar German sense of superiority and the civilizing mission is reflected in the close relation emerging between the term civilization (Civilisation) and geopolitical markers such as sea power (Seemacht) and world politics (Weltpolitik) at the end of the nineteenth century.<br>

The political interpretation of national identity within Germany is expressed by the term nationalism, which can be understood as a developing term first associated with foreign influences from the West and East (Bonapartismus, Polenklubs) and the indigenous national spirit (Nationalgeistes) propagated to counter France’s national ambitions. Interestingly, similarly to the UK, the German term nationalism becomes contested at the end of the century, as is evinced by its semantic association with pejorative terms with the suffix -ismus such as clericalism,  imperialism,  absolutism,  radicalism,  chauvinism, and fanaticism (Klerikalismus, Imperialismus, Absolutismus, Radikalismus, Chauvinismus, Fanatismus). In German discourse, the term state (Staat) does not make inroads, as the associated vocabulary suggests competition between governmental intervention and private initiatives, such as compulsory insurance (Versicherungszwang), private firm (Privatbetrieb), artisans (Handwerkerstand), and, at the end of the century, taxation (Steuerbezahler, Fiscus). The Hegelian conception of national identity, lastly, is reflected in the frequent use of the term spirit of the nation (Nationalgeist) in connection with the German nation. In the 1870s, this term is associated with terms such as idealism,  spirit,  patriotism and national identity (Idealismus, Geist, Patriotismus), which may reflect an essentialist, or Hegelian, interpretation of national identity. In the 1880s, terms such as idealism,  altruism,  fatalism,  naturalism, and national character (Idealismus, Altruismus, Fatalismus, Volkscharacter) dominate, perhaps suggesting a conceptual change towards a more moral and personal interpretation of national identity.<br>

In the German-language newspapers that were published in the United States (DE-CA), the concept of the nation is used in a radically different political context. Across the Atlantic, the nation became immediately connected with justice,  politics, party,  government, and principles (Nation, Gerechtigkeit, Politik, Partei, Regierung, Grundsätze), which illustrates how readily German migrants absorbed the constitutional context of their adopted nation. That adaptation may also explain the emergence of the term republic (Republik) in the 1850s, and race (Rasse) during the last years of the nineteenth century, in the discourse of nation. Similarly, the term democracy (Demokratie) became associated with heated party politics in the post-Jackson years of the 1840s, resulting in terms such as slave owner and slavery question (Sklavenhalter, Sklavenfrage) in the late 1840s, and Republican in the 1850s. The occurrence of references to silver and prohibition (Silberfrage, Silberleute, Prohibition and Prohibitionisten) in the vocabulary around democracy during the last decades of the century illustrates that German immigrants absorbed the key concerns of political populism, such as alcohol prohibition and resentment against the silver standard, which divided the rest of the United States <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. For German immigrants in the United States, the term folk (Volk) is associated with germanness (Deutschthum) from the late 1850s and fatherland (Vaterland) from the 1880s. During the 1860s, references to civil rights and citizenship (Bürgerrecht, Bürgerthum) are associated with people (Volk), and with workers (Proletariat) from the 1890s, which may be a reflection of the emerging radicalism in the United States of socialist and anarchist groups, inspired by European movements <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>.<br>

The case of Finland provides an interesting point of comparison with English and German datasets. Finland was originally a region of the Swedish Kingdom, annexed by the Russian Empire during the Napoleonic Wars. The Grand Duchy of Finland (1809–1917) was an autonomous part of Russia and can be considered as a predecessor of the Republic of Finland, founded in 1917. The fact that Finland is a bilingual country had consequences for Finnish nationalism. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, Finnish intellectuals and civil servants understood only Swedish, whereas the common people tended to use Finnish in their communication. This led to a situation where the early promoters of Finnish nationalism typically published in Swedish, and could not understand Finnish. However, towards the end of the nineteenth century, the Finnish language slowly replaced Swedish as the main language of the press, and during the peak of Finnish nationalism (Fennomania) , many Swedish-speaking families changed their first language to Finnish.<sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup></p>
<p>Academic scholarship has emphasized the role of the German example in the early development of Finnish nationalism. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, folk (folk in Swedish or kansa in Finnish) was a term used in the idealized context of national Romanticism. Johann Gottfried von Herder and German Romanticism were important models for early Finnish nationalists like Adolf Ivar Arwidsson (1791–1858), active in the 1810s and 1820s. From the beginning, the press was the most important forum for Arwidsson’s nationalist activity. He founded the radical journal  <em>Åbo Morgonblad</em> , which was suppressed by the Russian Tsar in 1821. After the short period of Finnish Romanticism in Turku, the intellectual center moved to Helsinki where the Hegelian philosophy became popular. When writing about the conceptual history of folk (kansa), <a href="#liikanen2003">Liikanen (2003)</a> emphasizes the importance of the Fennomans and their Hegelian understanding of national spirit (kansallishenki, nationalanda from German Volksgeist). Inspired by Hegelian philosophy, the Finnish philosopher Johann Vilhelm Snellman (1806–81) introduced the concept of spirit (Geist in German, anda in Swedish, and henki in Finnish) into the Finnish nationalist discourse. Although our word vector models start from the 1840s, the Hegelian tradition is reflected in these German and Swedish word vector models. Both German and Swedish word vector models associated the Hegelian concept of spirit with patriotism.  Fosterlandskärlek (love for country) is also strongly linked with the concept of spirit in Swedish results. Finally, the concept of national spirit (kansallishenki) is also associated with a mixture of nationalist terms and Hegelian technical terminology in the Finnish results (see Table 12).<br>

<h2 id="b-the-ethnic-roots-of-national-identity">B. The ethnic roots of national identity</h2>
<p>It has been customary to make a distinction between cultural and ethnic nationalism <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>. For example, the late eighteenth-century philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder is considered an important early theoretician of nationalism, although he in fact objected to the biological race theories of his time. When Herder emphasized the importance of local national cultures, his intention was to defend small states against the imperialism of the multinational empires of the time <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>Nisbet 1999). However, after the development of positivism, scientism, and Darwinism, late nineteenth-century nationalism became more based on ideas of ethnicity, race, and the shared biological descent of national populations. This is also reflected in our results. In the Fenno-Swedish corpus, nationality (nationalitet) is associated with descent and origins. It seems that nationality and ancestry (härkomst) are also associated with religious confession (trosbekännelse). In contrast to these Swedish results, German word vector models for the concept of nationality (Nationalität) indicate a clear association between race and ancestry. Finally, the Finnish model is very different to the Fenno-Swedish and German results. The concepts in the word vector space linked with nationality (kansallisuus) refer to siwistys (cultivation, cf., Bildung), kulttuuri (culture), kirjallisuus (literature), sanomakirjallisuus (press), kieli (language), and aate (idea), which are related more to cultural nationalism than ethnic nationalism (see Table 13).<br>

In German newspapers (DE-SBB) of the same period, the ethnic roots of national identity are reflected by the close association between the term folk (Volk), christianity ( Christentum) and army (Heer). In similar fashion, the term nationality (Nationalität) is used in the context of words that strongly suggest heritage, such as descent (Abkunft), heredity (Abstammung), religion (Konfession, Religion, Christian, Mission), and language, both spoken and written,  local and national (Schriftsprache, Landessprache, Muttersprache, Volkssprache). The term nation is also closely related to civilization (Civilisation) and mores (Gesittung).</p>
<h2 id="c-citizens-peoples-and-masses">C. Citizens, peoples, and masses</h2>
<p>As discussed, Koselleck emphasizes that the politicization of nation and folk in Germany towards the end of the nineteenth century was connected with the development of the labour movement and concepts related to anonymous multitudes of people, like mass or mob <sup id="fnref1:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. In other words, the politicization of folk did not only happen against other nations, but also in relation to the inner power structures of each country. This temporal process, where the connotations of folk change substantially, is reflected very clearly in all of the national newspaper corpora analysed here. For example, in FI-NLF the term the poor (köyhälistö) becomes associated with folk (kansa) only from the 1890s onwards. In SE-NLF, social class (samhällsklass) appears in association with folk from the 1870s (Figure 1). In DE-SBB, references to popular representation (Volksvertretung) appear in the word vector space around nation in the 1870s and 1880s, and workers (Arbeiter) appears mainly in the 1880s. Similarly, terms such as mob (Janhagel) and rabble (Pöbel) appear in the vocabulary around nation with connotations such as riot,  fright,  alarm, and rebellion (Aufruhr, Schrecken, Allarm, Aufstand). The term folk (Volk) becomes semantically linked to workers (Proletariat) in the 1890s (Figure 1).</p>

<p>Whereas the labour movement sympathized with the poor and the proletariat, the political conservatives often made a distinction between folk – the ideal common people – and the disobedient rabble. In SE-NLF it seems that when common people are idealized and well-behaving, they are  <em>folk</em> , but when they rebel, they become an anonymous rabble. In the DE-CA corpus, for instance, the concept of Volk (folk) is associated with Schicksal (destiny) in the beginning of the nineteenth century, whereas the association with Proletariat rises towards the end of the century (Figure 2). However, the etymological connections between Germanic languages can be misleading in this case. For example, English people is relatively neutral, whereas its German and Swedish homonyms Pöbel and pöbeln refer to a pejorative political concept meaning mob or rabble, i.e. a disorderly crowd of people <sup id="fnref2:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. The division between idealized folk and dangerous rabble is reflected in Fenno-Swedish word vector models as well: the concept of rabble (pöbeln) is associated with rebels (rebellerna). In Finnish, rahvas (or rahwas) was first used as a neutral term to refer to common people, but acquired the pejorative meaning of rabble (roskajoukko) towards the end of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In TDA, too, the term nation becomes associated with the concept of democracy from the 1860s on, and the concept similarity score gradually increases until 1900 A contested aspect of national unity within the United Kingdom is suggested by the terms which appear in the context of the people, where a consistently strong association with countrymen and peasantry, as well as with Englishmen and Irishmen, reflects the growing tensions around industrialization, urbanization, and home rule. References to Ireland typically evoke subaltern terms such as oppressed,  colonists, and loyalists in the word vector space. The proximity between people and the term agitators in the models of the last decades of the century may reflect the rise of trade unions in the UK.</p>
<p>An interesting transatlantic context is presented by the words surrounding the concept of citizenship within the UK, as the term inalienable remains dominant until the first decade of the twentieth century. This seems a clear reference to the inalienable rights that were promised in the American Declaration of Independence, which may have informed the British debate about citizenship and national identity. The proximity of terms such as privileges,  birthright, and heritage also illustrates the British dissension about the concept of nation and the right to be a citizen. If we superimpose the timeseries of independence and citizenship from the word vector model based on the query of nationality on the same plot, we can see that, during the beginning of the nineteenth century, independence is more frequently used in association with nationality, whereas citizenship dominates at the end of the nineteenth century (Figure 3).</p>

<h2 id="d-comparing-nations-linking-vocabularies">D. Comparing nations, linking vocabularies</h2>
<p>The word vector models illustrate that the concept of nation, in spite of its common origin, is expressed in divergent semantic contexts in the European countries examined here. The Finnish connotations of nation lean towards a cultural interpretation, suggested by terms like spirit and idea, culture, literature and language. German discourse points at a shared heritage that also suggests a cultural interpretation, as is visible in words such as Christianity and civilization. Although the English-language word vector models of TDA were not as clear, the British concept of nation seems to emphasize historical continuity as the basis of national identity, apparent in terms such as destiny and fatherland. British and German word vectors demonstrate a conceptual shift from a public to a more personal understanding of nation, in which state and government are seen as intruders of the private sphere, suggested by references to disorganization, taxation and private enterprises. Germany and Finland share a tendency to understand the nation in essentialist and spiritual terms, where the term folk embodies the body politic. At the same time, all language sets show that the people evoked negative connotations by the vicinity of alarming terms such as rabble,  mob, and revolt. The transatlantic connections, lastly, were visible in the British corpus (especially in the references to independence, citizenship and inalienable rights), but virtually absent in the German and Finnish newspapers. Although the word vector models of the German newspapers printed in the United States were not as conclusive, they suggested an interesting avenue of transnational comparison for future research, particularly with respect to the way the nation is understood in different geographical and historical contexts.</p>
<p>If, on the one hand, word vectors lack the precision of a thorough conceptual analysis such as the one conducted by  <em>GGB</em> , on the other, they offer the advantage of extending the analysis on much larger datasets that, it can be argued, reflect the public discourse of a larger readership. The longue durée has shown, for instance, the relative instability of the connection between nation and monarchy in the UK. Due to the limitations of having to work with small datasets, these are subtle changes that the  <em>GGB</em> , which is based on a limited set of key texts, could not have noticed.</p>
<p>More importantly, the parallel presentation of word vector models from newspapers in different languages opens up a multilingual comparison of public debates around common concepts. Although our methodology has had to rely on modern translations of seed words, detailed comparisons of domain knowledge still allow for a thorough interpretation of the research results. This offers many interesting heuristic possibilities to discover changes in newspaper discourse that may result from conceptual change. The current methodology does not allow us to track cross-border migration of concepts, but it does demonstrate commonalities and contrasts that can direct future research.</p>
<h2 id="6-case-study-ii-illness-and-disease">6. Case study II: Illness and disease</h2>
<p>Compared to the concepts of nation and nationhood,  illness and disease are different in nature: in all languages studied in this experiment, illness is not a migratory concept produced by modernization, but has profound local cultural roots that are based on older migratory ties. For example, the Finnish word sairaus (illness) derives from sairas (ill), which originates from the Germanic word sairaz which means sore or painful. The German word for ill, krank, also has proto-Germanic roots; it derives from krangaz or krankaz, which means crooked or weak <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>. Despite the regional etymological rootedness of the concept of illness, our experiment shows that, increasingly, new conceptual linkages and influences emerged during the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In general, the word embeddings in Finnish, Swedish, German, and English refer to different horizons of meaning from three frames of reference. The vocabularies list words that 1. refer to symptoms or signs of being ill such as, for instance, fever or weakness; 2. identify particular diseases that raged in the nineteenth century, from isolated cases of the common cold to influenza and cholera pandemics; and 3. Show the consequences of becoming ill, like passing away, or becoming disabled through injury. Thus, the models retrieve vocabularies that conceptualize illness from distinct perspectives, ranging from symptoms and specific diseases to their consequences for human beings. Our experiment shows that illness cannot be traced to one stable ontological category, because these aspects are affected by shifting social and cultural contexts that result from specific economic, political, and social histories.</p>
<h2 id="a-towards-the-transnational-semantics-of-illness">A. Towards the transnational semantics of illness</h2>
<p>In the first experiment, we search for the 15 most related terms for the concept term “illness” in the word embeddings of all corpora for the different time spans. For all different corpora, we encounter spelling variations that have resulted from OCR problems. For example, for the German word Krankheit (illness) we also retrieve terms like Kraukheit or Krankhett, and the Swedish word sjukdom (illness) was retrieved as fjukdom and fjuldom. To enable a better view of the results, we merge these spelling variations for all terms and compute their average similarity score.</p>

<p>In addition, we retrieve synonyms of the term illness such as sickness and disease, which validate the reliability of the semantic models. We focus on the most similar terms that appear in at least four of the different models with a continuous time span, confirming their significance in the corpora. This enables us to identify discrepancies across the different languages and corpora.</p>
<h2 id="b-the-conceptualization-of-pandemics">B. The conceptualization of pandemics</h2>
<p>The modern era has been characterized by pandemics <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>. The word pandemic itself is a Greek loanword that refers to diseases that affect all ( <em>pan</em> ) people ( <em>demos</em> ). In the nineteenth century, new forms of transport and mobility enabled the rapid spread of diseases. Cholera and influenza in particular raged on a global scale <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>. This effect of globalization is visible in our results. Since the corpora cover slightly different timespans, they do not offer any comprehensive picture of how pandemics emerged and developed conceptually. However, the results refer to different regional perceptions of pandemics. In themselves, epidemic and pandemic are ancient words that have been used in many European languages since at least the seventeenth century <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>. In SE-NLF, the Swedish word epidemi appears eleven times from 1858–68 onwards. At the same time, it also shows up in DE-CA, first as Seuche, which was retrieved as similar to Krankheit, 16 times. The loanword Epidemie appears in the results slightly later, in 1864–74. In DE-CA, the term cholera is retrieved in 1858–68, obviously as a result of the so-called third cholera pandemic of 1846–60. In Europe, cholera raged particularly violently during the Crimean War of the 1850s, but the pandemic soon reached the Americas in the late 1850s, which accounts for discussions in the German immigrant press that label cholera  <em>the</em>  disease. While the closeness of real pandemics to their conceptual reflections is obvious, the word embeddings indicate that pandemics also caused conceptual changes.</p>
<p>In addition to cholera, influenza constitutes a further interesting example that gained weight in the nineteenth century. The so-called Russian flu pandemic was particularly lethal in 1889–90. In the Swedish corpus, too, influenza appears in 1888–98. In FI-NLF influenza appears for the first time as influentsa in 1884–94, not as a synonym for sairaus (see above) but for tauti, another Finnish term for illness. As a concept, influenza went almost as viral as the disease itself. There were, of course, references to influenza before the 1880s, but the international loanword (and its variations) was not used, according to our empirical data. Semantically, influenza hides behind different words, such as flu, or breast or lung disease.</p>
<h2 id="c-nervous-diseases-and-the-social-boundaries-of-illness">C. Nervous diseases and the social boundaries of illness</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the understanding of the mechanisms of nervous diseases was mostly pathological. However, in the course of the century, modern psychology developed a more internal view of the human mind <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>. In the newspaper corpora, nervous diseases appear increasingly towards the end of the nineteenth century. At the turn of the twentieth century there were particularly vivid discussions about neurasthenia. This term for weakness of the nerves was coined in the 1820s, but became popular from the 1860s onwards, especially after the publication of George Miller Baird’s article  “Neurasthenia, or nervous exhaustion,”  in  <em>The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal</em>  in 1869 <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>. Neurasthenia was often seen as a disease caused by the accelerating rhythms of modern culture <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>. Nervous diseases start to appear in our models in the 1860s, and remain an essential conceptual aspect of illness going forward.<br>

The same observation applies to mental diseases. Nervenkrankheit (nervous disease) is retrieved in DE-SBB first in 1882–892, and four times thereafter. In the DE-EU, it comes up in 1888–98, in total eight times during the whole timespan, and in the SE-NLF in 1898–1908 three times in total as nervsjukdom. Mental health issues also appeared through a plethora of similar words: in Swedish as sinnessjukdom (mental disease), as many as forty times after 1862–72; in DE-EU as Geisteskrankheit ten times after 1872–82; and in the DE-SBB four times during the same period. This is not to argue that nervous or mental problems had not been diagnosed before, but conceptually they became more eminent as defining principles for illness.</p>
<p>There are clear differences between the corpora, however. The examples from the Swedish and German material refer to different timescales in the discourses and articulations on nervous and mental issues. It also appears that  <em>Nervenkrankheit</em>  is not being retrieved in DE-CA or in FI-NLF. Although the models do not make the reasons for this absence clear, these results may be explained by the different audiences of the Finnish-language and German immigrant press. The former was addressing a rural population, whereas neurasthenia was mainly discussed in a middle-class context. This is also supported by the fact that the Finnish-language models yielded many words that refer to animal and plant diseases, which were important for the rural readership of the Finnish-language press. These findings support the conclusion that illness fuelled conceptual migrations across borders, while at the same time reflecting social boundaries for the conceptualization of diseases. However, the word vector models do not allow for further exploration of the context of these concepts, which means that the semantic interaction between human and natural domains in a period when Darwinian evolution theory was debated worldwide would require more research <sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="d-debating-causes-symptoms-and-consequences">D. Debating causes, symptoms, and consequences</h2>
<p>The etiological standpoint, coined by Robert Koch in the 1870s, refers to the assumption that diseases are best controlled and understood by means of their causes. Since this theory has dominated medical discourse for the past two centuries, much of contemporary medical practice concentrates on identifying specific causes of disease. A disease, however, is regularly defined by specifying its nature. To study the representation of illness at community-level in the nineteenth century, our results show that this identity can be expressed by more than causes. Our word embeddings reflect this by showing vocabularies which conceptualize illness from different perspectives such as symptoms, their consequences, synonymous terms, and treatment. By breaking up illness into categories (e.g. treatment, consequences, and symptoms) we can demonstrate its multimodal nature as a concept without fixed entities. Moreover, the word illness is used in different senses or meanings. The aim of this use case is to investigate whether the dominant sense of illness changed over time. The findings support the claim that  “there is no single way of defining, interpreting, experiencing or managing disease”   <sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>. Our results show that, in contrast to medical discourse, the nineteenth-century press did not concentrate on causes and aetiology of diseases, but rather focused on their human consequences.</p>
<p>To investigate the change in word sense, we first translate all similar terms for illness into nineteenth-century English. Then, two annotators assign categories to each term. After a close reading of the vocabulary, we define the subcategories listed in Table 16:<br>
Subdivided categories of illness, their abbreviation, and textual examples.    Category  Abbreviation  Example      treatment  T  surgery      consequences  C  death      synonymy  M  disease      symptoms  S  pain      specific disease   D  cholera      other  ?

        <p>The consequences of diseases. The shifting temporal and corpus-specific patterns in all datasets of disease, in terms of its retrieved vocabulary referring to consequences of diseases. This is based on our categorization of illness, category C (see Table 16).
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure></p>
<p>We assigned words such as death,  crisis, or incurable to the consequences category, sore throat,  tiredness, or vomiting to the symptoms category, ill, or sickness to the synonymy category, cholera,  influenza, or mental disease to a category for specific diseases, surgery, or inoculation to treatment, and words that were not context-related to the other category.</p>
<p>The annotation and comparison of the different subcategories highlights that the majority of generated words are synonyms and consequences of diseases. These categories are dominant in all six corpora. As Figure 5 illustrates, analysis of word embeddings in diverse newspaper corpora suggests the discussion of consequences of diseases rarely respects local, regional, or national borders. This leads to the conclusion that the press constructed illness as a concept with an emphasis on its consequences. This emphasis is supported by mainly negative characteristics such as, for instance, epidemic,  poverty, “died”, and suffering. Thus, diseases are represented as agents of suffering, misery, and death, which have a strong negative impact on human lives.</p>
<p>However, shifting temporal and corpus-specific patterns can be observed, as illustrated by Figure 5. Whereas DE-SBB only textualizes consequences from 1870 onwards, no words categorized as consequences seem to occur in DE-EU after 1878. Moreover, words that refer to consequences are widely discussed in FI-NLF and SE-NLF throughout the entire time span.</p>
<p>Analysing the different categories in which the concept illness is discussed in newspapers allows us to trace the fluctuating meanings of disease and illness as a superordinate category. The overview of subcategories also helps us to consider the role of the press in defining diseases. The fact that there was a strong emphasis on the consequences of illness may be explained by the dual nature of newspaper discourse. On the one hand, the press constructed fear of diseases by describing the disastrous consequences of illness, becoming a platform for emotional expression. On the other, the press expressed social observations and shared them with a wider audience. Pandemics such as influenza and cholera were strongly present in the nineteenth-century public sphere, and papers informed their readers of their impact on the life of an individual as well as on society.</p>
<p>The combination of synchronic and diachronic analysis of word vector models allows us to trace the development of an abstract concept such as illness over time in newspaper corpora in different languages. We can discover how specific diseases emerged in public discourse in Europe and the United States at different times in history, such as the epidemics of cholera and influenza that affected these parts of the world. More interestingly, word vectors are an effective instrument to trace the vocabularies with which national publics discussed – and constructed – diseases, and their supposed causes and consequences. Our study shows the influence of public discourse, newspaper publishing in particular, on definitions of illness and the multidimensional network of relations between symptoms, specific diseases, and their consequences to construct the concept of illness. Although this case study was limited to newspaper collections from a small number of nations, the differences and silences in discourse, and the changing vocabularies that emerge from the word vector models, offer interesting heuristic starting points for a close reading of these corpora within their proper historical context.</p>
<h2 id="7-discussion">7. Discussion</h2>
<p>Although the two use cases demonstrate the ways in which word embeddings can be used for the transnational comparison of concepts and vocabularies over time, this experiment also illustrates the following methodological and technological challenges in using multilingual historical newspaper datasets for the construction of word vector models.</p>
<pre><code>OCR issues: One of the major issues we face with historic newspaper data is the OCR quality. Some newspaper pages simply cannot be converted due to low scan quality, and further issues arise with spelling variations. For example, the German word Volk appears also as Bolk and Volt. To solve this issue, we merged variations and used their average similarity in our study.     Different language properties: For the computation of the models, we perform the same pre-processing by using standard tokenization methods. However, because we are using tokenization that mostly splits words by white spaces, multiword expressions composed of two words separated by white space are also split. While this is not an issue for the Germanic languages, where multiword expressions are often close compounds, we lose these terms for the English corpus. This was particularly evident for the illness case study, where specific diseases are often represented as multiword units, leading to entirely different results. In this article, however, we cannot address the task of computing paraphrase embeddings or detecting multiword expressions, and will leave this to future work.     Corpus differences: We use dense vector space models to compare the shift of concepts across different languages and corpora. However, besides language differences, the corpora we use to compute the models are very diverse in size and composition, and represented different time periods. Comparisons between concepts across corpora is only possible for overlapping time periods. While we have the entire time span of newspapers in TDA, we have no, or only few, newspapers from 1840 to 1855 for most other corpora. Models for semantic similarity tend to be more stable if the size of the corpora used for the computations is large [^riedl2013]  [^altszyler2017]. We observe the general trend that the number of newspapers increased with time. For the first decades of the nineteenth century, we often have only a few texts, making the models less reliable. In addition, the individual newspaper datasets differ from one another. While TDA only contains newspaper issues from a single source, we use German-language newspapers of several European countries in the German Europeana corpus. In addition, newspapers are always targeted to a specific audience. The Finnish corpus is mostly comprised of newspapers from rural regions, and thus represents specific concerns (e.g. about farming) and mostly does not cover urban trends.     Parameters of word embeddings: The embeddings depend on the parameters used for the computation, as well as the number of similar terms that are extracted. For the computation of the embeddings, we relied on standard parameters as provided by the ShiCo tool (see footnote 2).    Conceptual dissimilarities: This article studied conceptual change in two different sets of concepts, those of collective nationhood, and those of the personal circumstances of health and illness. As we have argued, both are cultural constructions that change over time, and both are embedded in their specific cultural context. Koselleck et al also draw attention to the frequent use of metaphors of illness, health, and the body to express concerns about the state of the nation as body politic [^koselleck2006]. However, the word vector models shows no overlap between the two semantic domains within the corpora that were used. The connection between the two conceptual sets can only be established on the basis of historical domain knowledge which takes the specific historical context into account.

<h2 id="8-conclusion">8. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Historical newspapers allow us to study how everyday concepts have been used in public discourse. This article discusses how word vector models can help us to trace how such concepts were articulated in shifting vocabularies as they moved over time and space. This addresses the methodological question: how can computational methods be applied to broaden the scope of conceptual history? In order to test the usability of word vector models, we address two urgent academic questions within the field of conceptual history. The first is to what extent concepts are stable entities that are expressed in changing vocabularies over large periods of time, as <a href="#lovejoy1933">Lovejoy (1933)</a> famously suggested, or whether changing vocabularies should be understood as an indication of conceptual change, as other practitioners of conceptual history argue. We test this by concentrating on a historical time frame, the period between 1840 and 1914, in which the western world experienced the rapid changes of modernization and globalization and became interconnected through the new mass media of newspapers. The second, perhaps more complex, question is how we can use this computational methodology to trace how concepts change as they migrate over geographical and linguistic borders. For our dataset, we use digitized historical newspaper corpora in five different languages. As use cases, we select two radically different concepts that have a global presence, the collective identity of the nation and the deeply personal experience of illness.</p>
<p>This international and interdisciplinary research project, in which researchers from four academic institutions in Europe collaborate, illustrates the possibilities and challenges of using computational methods to analyse conceptual change over longer periods of time in different cultural and national contexts. We can formulate a number of promising findings:</p>
<p>Newspaper corpora. The computational tool ShiCo, which has been developed to trace shifting concepts over time by constructing series of overlapping word vector models, can effectively be applied to historical newspaper repositories of different provenance, metadata structure, and OCR quality, and, most interestingly of all, written in different languages. The resulting vocabularies were consistent enough to allow meaningful scholarly interpretation. Even if newspapers are commercial and professional media enterprises with their own ideological agendas, they can only survive if they reflect ongoing debates in society. The outcomes of this research project confirm that these combined newspapers collections are rich and promising sources for a computational approach to conceptual history, and may offer us a novel entry point into the historical public sphere.  Digital conceptual history. Our computational approach to conceptual history validates the application of a quantitative and big data method to this discipline. In comparison to traditional approaches to conceptual history, which tend to use limited textual corpora mostly produced by scholarly communities, this computational approach enables us to draw on the big data repositories of historical newspapers which reflect a much broader public discourse.  Time. Word vector models prove to be a convincing and promising tool to show how different vocabularies share the same semantic space over time. Although we define the term concept rather pragmatically, the word models show a consistent configuration that changed over time, sometimes gradually, sometimes rapidly, introducing new words or terms as a result of historical changes. The domain knowledge of the authors enables us to offer meaningful interpretations of these semantic changes. This offers a new way to trace how collective concepts such a nation, national identity, the people, and the more personal discussions of causes, symptoms and results of illness were articulated over a longer period of time, even spanning eight decades.  Space. The comparison of the word models created by applying the ShiCo software to separate newspaper repositories in different languages allows researchers to test the promise of comparative and transcultural conceptual history. Even if this method relies on translation of key terms and vocabularies in English, and on manual comparison based on historical domain knowledge, the results are significant and allow us to situate concepts such as nation and illness in its historical contexts.   Distant reading. As Moretti quipped,  “ambition is now directly proportional to the distance from the text: the more ambitious the project, the greater must the distance be”   <sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>. Indeed, word vector models seem to allow for an extreme form of distant reading of textual corpora which takes researchers far from the contextual content of the newspapers. But even as the text itself disappears out of sight, larger patterns emerge that carry heuristic value. By identifying trends and discontinuities in the way concepts are articulated in shifting vocabularies as they move over time and space, this form of distant reading can help us to understand how concepts are discussed in newspapers in various languages. Comparing word vector models based on newspapers from different national collections offers us a glimpse at the circulation of knowledge in the western world.</p>
<p>The outcomes of this article also suggest a number of avenues for future research:</p>
<p>Although word vectors models offer quantitative data about the words that appear in the semantic space around search queries or seed words, the comparison between different language corpora still relies on qualitative interpretation. A more robust method may be found in cross-mapping word vector models to represent the translation of concepts and terms <sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. The structure of the data and models currently does not allow for such computational application of translation vectors.   It would be valuable to divide the national newspaper corpora into different sub-collections of newspapers according to their political, religious or regional affiliation. Such segmentation would allow for comparisons of, for instance, Catholic or socialist newspapers from different linguistic and national backgrounds, or could offer indications of the audiences that are receptive to international influences or ideological affiliation. Segmentation would require server space and computer power that was not available for this project.  Another approach would be to develop a robust computational method to determine in which specific discursive contexts certain vocabularies and concepts were used (e.g. in which sections of the newspapers can references to national identity be found in newspapers from a particular period, and where were issues of health and illness discussed? Can the discursive context of these references be established?). This would necessitate combining the creation of word vectors of sufficient volume with automated segmentation of newspapers in departments, genres, or other sections that semantically belong to each other.   A more ambitious way to trace cross-national migration of ideas would be to implement algorithms that identify text reuse. Although this has been successfully attempted in monolingual corpora <sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>, text reuse in multilingual corpora is still in development. If combined with the heuristic potential of word vector models, text reuse could bring us closer to the scalable, zoomable and explorative readings that are the meeting ground between the big-data ambitions of distant reading and the semantic precision of close reading.</p>

<p>For querying similar terms, we use the following ShiCo parameters: non-adaptive search, maximal terms: 15, related terms: 20 and minimum similarity: 0.1. The other parameters were left on their default settings: word boost = 1, boost method = sum similarity, words per year = 5, weighing function = gaussian, etc. Documentation of these parameters and the ShiCo software is available at <a href="https://github.com/NLeSC/ShiCo">https://github.com/NLeSC/ShiCo</a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:46" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Augmented reality (AR) came to life for everyday users of digital technology when the game  <em>Pokémon Go</em>  took everyone to the streets with their small screens; users discovered a fictional world that could only be accessed digitally while blending with the surrounding real-life environment. In this article, we explore the alignment of worlds with different ontological statuses through digital blending in narrative fiction.</p>
<p>AR can be defined as a system that  “supplements the real world with virtual (computer-generated) objects that appear to coexist in the same space as the real world”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Used as a resource in digital literature, the real-world element may be a physical object or analogue medium that works with digital media to produce an enhanced version of a story. Hence, in this fictional use of AR, questions arise about the relationship between real and virtual worlds.</p>
<p>In the specific case of AR comics, our question is what adding an augmented layer does to the reading experience. According to Scott McCloud the comics medium is characterised by two formal features: The blending of words and images, and the sequential reading where panels and gutters offer a participatory reading experience for the reader to fill in the blanks between the panels <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Jason Helms refers to these characteristics and states that the examples of AR comics he has seen so far  “do not substantially augment the reading experience,”  either because they only enhance certain images, and not the storyworld as such, or because they disturb the sequential flow of reading. However, he sees some possibilities, requiring that the AR layer was created hand-in-hand with the comic book, and that the reading experience would be better integrated <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For this article, we apply Possible World Theory to discuss how fiction, which creates its own possible world <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, integrates the additional layer(s) of AR into its storyworld. We analyse the AR comic book  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  to explore how AR may contribute to a complex storyworld with several layers. We have a particular interest in how storytelling with digital media plays with story space across media and worlds and how this may affect a reader’s literary experience.</p>

<p>The AR comic  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> consists of a physical book and an accompanying phone app that supplements and changes the appearance of the book’s pages (see Figure 1). We chose this work to study how AR functions in narrative fiction, because the app consistently adds a layer throughout the comic book, as Helms <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> suggested. AR literature is still in its becoming, and few examples of narrative works take advantage of AR in creative ways. A variety of combinations of the virtual and what appears as real in some sense may be envisioned. After concluding our analysis, we return to a discussion of how our findings may be relevant to AR storytelling.</p>
<p>Other examples of AR in digital literature include  <em>57° North</em>   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, which requires a different physical object than a book to come to life. This app is combined with a Merge Cube onto which the story is projected. Different turns in the story are chosen by tilting the cube. The potential for using AR with physical objects seems extensive; however, in this story, its use is very limited. An AR comic project,  <em>Neon Wasteland</em>   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> was planned to launch in summer 2021; however, at this stage, only poster-like examples on the  <em>Neon Wasteland</em>  website that work with the app are available for download. There are examples of AR studios, such as BlippAR <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, making commercial AR campaigns and offering tools for AR development. They also provide an AR browser that, for instance, works with award-winning Indian  <em>Priya</em>  comics <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, which are about a female superhero. In these comics, the app makes interactive elements pop out of the pages including animation, films, etc., along with additional features such as AR puzzles. The subjects of the  <em>Priya</em>  comics have transparent educational or moral aims; for example, the latest release,  <em>Priya’s Mask</em>   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, is about stopping the spread of COVID-19.  <em>Wonderscope</em>   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> is an app that presents stories to young children. The characters of the stories merge with the users’ physical space. Each story is tagged with the stories’ themes (such as confidence, respect and inclusion) or with facts the user may learn about (e.g., solar science or fun facts). These examples show some of AR storytelling’s diversity and illustrate that AR has not yet established steady forms and conventions in literary genres.</p>
<p>In AR literature we see a potential for combining a multitude of worlds within one storyworld. In the analysis of  _Modern Polaxis, _ we explore the relationship between worlds and how these may affect the reader’s aesthetic (literary) experience. Even considering the other AR works mentioned,  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  is a pioneer in AR storytelling, as it is one of the first AR comics of its kind. Moreover, it is an independent (crowdfunded) project exploring new possibilities of AR storytelling. It entails a very complex story, requiring an experienced reader of multimodal texts, and thematises complicated issues, such as ontology and psychiatry. Additionally, its aesthetic aims make it an interesting object for literary analysis.</p>
<h2 id="previous-research-on-ar-narratives">Previous research on AR narratives</h2>
<p>Research on AR apps has revolved around apps designed for learning, or games such as  <em>Pokémon Go</em> , whereas studies on AR’s potential literary contributions are lacking. Several studies have drawn attention to children’s AR apps and educational settings (see, e.g., <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>), while fewer studies have addressed AR apps aimed at a wider audience that includes teenagers and adults.</p>
<p>Gunnar Liestøl (<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>; <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>) explored AR technologies’ narrative and rhetorical potential in the context of reconstructing historical events on location. This location perspective is a common concern in AR, along with an image or text as the base for the AR layer <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. The connection to the user’s physical location is also central to Anders Sundnes Løvlie’s project  <em>textopia</em> , which explored the relations between places and literary texts. The locative system allows a user to listen to texts relevant to the place where they are positioned. Løvlie <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> analysed literary strategies that allow readers and writers to connect literature to their lived environment. With  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , what is of interest is the tension between the analogue medium of the book and the digital layer added by the AR app, not the place in which the reader opens the book.</p>
<p>Weedon et al. <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> described an AR project called  <em>Sherwood Rise</em> , which revealed interesting possible effects of AR that can also be relevant to the analysis of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> . Weedon et al. see AR as a possibility to disguise and hide narratives and describe them as a way to  “signal the unexpected and as a mechanism to narrate mystery, confusion, altered/distorted or magical reality”   <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.  <em>Sherwood Rise</em>  creates tension between the static story (i.e., the printed book) and the dynamic story (i.e., the AR story), which  “was important to keep the reader engaged across platforms”   <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. This tension also applies to  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> . The interplay between layers is a crucial part of AR’s contribution to the literary experience. Consequently, we argue that AR has the potential to enrich storyworlds. It can create possible worlds of different ontological statuses between which tensions may arise and expand the storyworld in time and space.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-perspectives">Theoretical perspectives</h2>
<p>In AR literature, the reality that is augmented through an overlay of a digital medium may be location-based, anchored in a geographical, spatial reality, or it may be image-based, represented in a physical medium <sup id="fnref2:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. With fictional narratives, the reality level does not exist independently of the text. This means that in fiction, AR functions as an interplay between levels that may be characterised as possible worlds, albeit expressed in different media. Ryan <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> noted that possible world (PW) theory, transferred from its origin in philosophy and modal logic, can shed light on the narrative experience. For narratologists, PWs are  “constructs of the imagination, as objects of aesthetic contemplation, and as conditions of narrative immersion”   <sup id="fnref2:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. In line with Ryan <sup id="fnref3:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, we assume that immersion in a storyworld is essential to the experience of narrative fiction.</p>
<p>Ryan and Bell, in their work on narrative semantics inspired by PW theory, focused on the internal organisation of storyworlds, which they described as  “entire modal universes consisting of multiple worlds”   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. One world will appear to the reader as the actual world within the text (i.e., textual actual world, TAW), whereas the others are alternate possible worlds (TPWs) <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. As Ryan <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> stated in her PW theory,  “The central element is commonly interpreted as  the actual world  and the satellites as merely possible worlds. For a world to be possible, it must be linked to the centre by a so-called accessibility relation” . These accessibility relations can be necessary, possible or impossible <sup id="fnref2:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Which world is seen as TAW is determined by the reader’s act of recentring into the narrative universe, where what appears as narrative facts comprises the TAW.</p>
<p>This understanding is in line with the so-called modal realism formulated by philosopher David Lewis, who pointed out that what is actual is indexical:  “Our actual world is only one world among others. We call it actual not because it differs in kind from all the rest but because it is the world we inhabit”  (Lewis 1979 in <sup id="fnref3:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>). A TAW may also include the characters’ private worlds, revealing their state of mind (i.e., beliefs, dreams, desires and fears).  “Through these imaginary constructs, narrative universes acquire distinct ontological levels,”  according to Ryan and Bell <sup id="fnref4:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These levels are imperative for understanding how AR literature may blend worlds. Since AR merges digital and analogue textual experiences, it can be seen as transfictionality <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> or transmedia storytelling <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Ryan <sup id="fnref4:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> discussed the basic operations of transfictionality and sorted out three: expansion, modification and transposition. These have inspired our discussion of how the augmented layer contributes to the aesthetic experience of AR literature.</p>
<p>Ryan <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> also presents three dimensions of storyworlds: completeness, distance and size; the former two are most relevant to our discussion. In philosophical PW theory ontological completeness is a condition for PWs to count as worlds. Fictional PWs, in contrast, are characterised by not being complete. On the contrary, Lubomír Doležel <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> described fictional worlds as areas of indeterminacy. Ruth Ronen <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> stated that  “the fictional world system is an independent system whatever the type of fiction constructed and the extent of drawing on our knowledge of the actual world” . According to Ryan <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>, completeness does not require a total description of settings or characters; rather, it raises the question of how much the reader needs to know to become immersed in the storyworld. Missing information does not necessarily threaten completeness; indeed, it may encourage the reader to supply information based on their own life experiences, as in Wolfgang Iser’s <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> reception theory, in which filling empty spaces and dealing with indeterminacies are vital to the reader’s encounter with the text. A different matter involves ontological gaps in the storyworld <sup id="fnref5:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, which may include contradictions within the TAW and between the PWs comprising the narrative universe.</p>
<p>Distance concerns the storyworld’s relation to the actual world, which involves a range of variations, from realistic to fantastic stories. The TAW of the storyworld may deviate from the world as we know it, as long as it is consistent within its own logic. The distance from the reader’s actual world can be described in terms of how many rules in the actual world can be broken in the TAW of the storyworld <sup id="fnref6:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. According to what Ryan <sup id="fnref2:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> coined the principle of minimal departure, readers imagine a fictional world to be the closest possible to the actual world they inhabit and make only the changes mandated by the text. A storyworld may even contain elements or events that the reader would consider logically impossible. Here, Ryan <sup id="fnref7:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> distinguishes between paradoxes that contribute to the plot on the one hand and contradiction for its own sake on the other. The former is limited to certain areas and may  “open logical holes in the fabric of storyworlds”   <sup id="fnref8:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the reader is central in determining which possible world to consider actual in the storyworld. This points to the reader’s role in interpreting how actual and possible worlds relate within the storyworld. Umberto Eco <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> includes the reader as an active part of the constellation of possible worlds that comprise the narrative universe. He described three types of possible worlds connected to the fabula, the characters and the reader, respectively. The first type represents the fabula as a succession of states mediated by events that correspond to the actual world of the narrative (i.e., the TAW). The second type corresponds to the characters’ mental activities, involving their imaginations, beliefs and wishes (i.e., TPWs, according to Ryan). The third type of world is found in the unfolding of the story in the reader’s mind.</p>
<p>Including a reception perspective on the interplay between possible worlds in AR fiction is hence in correspondence with PW theory and the specific situation of reading digital narratives. The readers are central through their perceptions of what makes up the actual world of the text and their assessment of how this relates to the actual world of their own life experience. The readers also play an active part in interacting with the digital layer of AR.</p>
<p>In his reception theory, Iser is concerned with what the text  <em>does</em>  in the encounter with the reader. He sees the text as  “a network of response-inviting structures”   <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>, in which meaning emerges through the reader’s semantic operations. He stated that  “fiction devoid of any connection with known reality would be incomprehensible”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> and that  “the literary text is a mixture of reality and fiction, and as such, it brings about an interaction between the given and the imagined”   <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Iser <sup id="fnref2:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> described the semantic operations specific to reading fiction as a triad of fictionalising acts inscribed in the text and realised in the reading event. The first is the act of selecting recognisable elements from the actual world; the second is the act of combining them in new ways in the fictional world; the third is the contract of reading the text as fiction, which in our view involves an open attitude towards the PWs included in the storyworld. Iser’s perspectives were based on written literature, but he emphasised that these semantic processes do not primarily function on the level of words but rather meanings <sup id="fnref3:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We find that Iser’s argument about the interplay between the fictive, the real (or actual) and the imaginary (or possible) brought together by the reader’s interaction with the text also has relevance for reading AR literature. In the case of AR comics, blanks and indeterminacies may arise in the gutters between panels, or in the interplay between words and images and other modes in the multimodal AR ensemble. In the following, we take the case of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  as a point of departure for analysing the interplay of worlds in AR fiction, be they actual, possible or impossible, and we discuss the reader’s position and how the augmented layer may affect the literary experience. Based on this case, we finally discuss what the AR interface may contribute to digital literature more generally.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p><em>Modern Polaxis</em>  represents two different ways of seeing the world based on two versions of the diary of one fictional character presented in two media: a comic book with one or more panels on each page, and an AR app adding colours, animations and soundscape, effectively expanding or modifying the story presented in the book. The AR layer does not work unless you have the book at hand, whereas the book stands poorly by itself without the AR layer, as it does not present the full story. Together, these two elements create one aesthetic work and comprise one storyworld, albeit divided. The main character is presented on the  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  website as  “a paranoid time traveller”  who  “believes the world we live in is a holographic projection from another plane in the universe.”</p>
<p>From the very beginning,  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  invites the reader to make ontological reflections by starting with a presentation of Plato’s allegory of the cave. In this allegory, people are trapped and chained in a cave, watching a stone wall where shadows are projected from real-world elements, passing a fire behind them, thus resembling a shadow theatre. They believe the shadows are the actual world, while Polaxis states that  “the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> . Through this, the question is raised of what is real and whether our experiences can be trusted to give access to real knowledge, which, in Plato’s philosophy, is the world of ideas. In the book version, the prisoners seem to be inside the cave, staring at stone walls. The AR layer adds blue skies where the stone wall used to be and the stone walls’ structures suddenly become trees, effectively enhancing the cave allegory’s question of whether the perceived reality can be trusted. This opening scene is positioned outside the time and space of the storyworld, serving as a framework for understanding — and questioning — the worlds presented through Polaxis’s diary.</p>
<p>This philosophical framing may be key to understanding the text’s use of AR, with the analogue book representing the TAW and a TPW, while the digital enrichment of the AR app represents an additional PW, including comments, doubts and suspicions. Another philosophical reference is the principle of  “time binding”   <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, a concept known from Polish-American scholar Alfred Korzybski, which concerns how memories may be transferred in time and space through the use of symbols. In  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , this seems to support the main character’s efforts to escape the limitations of human perception and knowledge of the world. Korzybski was best known for his dictum,  “the map is not the territory” , which indicates that human knowledge is limited and that no one can have direct access to reality. This fundamental doubt about what one perceives through the senses is set as a premise for the story to be told. It affects the reader’s trust in what is being told and, at the same time, substantiates the protagonist’s reasoning for challenging these limitations within the fictional world.</p>
<p>These tensions are also connected to the book’s and the app’s subjective first-person viewpoint. The story is told through the paranoid and delusional Polaxis without other commenting viewpoints than the philosophical framing mentioned above. The diary’s verbal text appears to be handwritten by Polaxis and is not easily accessible, as it is very small and dense. This makes the text physically hard to read. The images in the book are mostly line drawings in black and red, and image and verbiage are tightly interwoven. Even though the book looks small, this is a comprehensive work. The amount of written verbal language is significant and central to conveying the story. The digital layer enriches the text with an elaborate soundscape, colours and animation, sometimes omitting or replacing the book’s verbal text. These layers present the complicated worlds that Polaxis is struggling to navigate, which we explore further in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="the-worlds-of-modern-polaxis">The worlds of Modern Polaxis</h2>
<p>_Modern Polaxis’s _ book and AR app constitute one storyworld. According to Ryan <sup id="fnref9:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>,  “[n]arratives that represent travel between different worlds in the planetary or insular sense”  present only one storyworld. For analytical clarity, we first discuss what constitutes the TAW and how it relates to other possible worlds (TPWs) in the book before turning to the app and what it contributes to the storyworld’s totality. Next, we explore more closely how the storyworld unfolds in time and space. Then, we discuss how ontological gaps in this particular constellation of PWs, enabled by the digital layer, challenge how the TPWs and the TAW are understood.</p>
<p>To determine what to consider the TAW of the storyworld, we looked for accessibility relations that connect to the reader’s actual world, relations that make up the grid of a TAW easily recognised by a reader. Several points in time and place connect this storyworld to the reader’s actual world, including geographical names (e.g., Brisbane, the Amazon and St. Viateur Bagels) and specific dates (see Table 1). If seen in connection to the fabula as a succession of states mediated by events <sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>, the TAW is, in a simplified version, the story of a young man from Brisbane with the mundane job of scanning military maps. After a traumatising crisis that makes him feel trapped <sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and a night  “fuelled with spiced rum”   <sup id="fnref3:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, he starts a new life. He randomly travels to Montreal, Canada, where he meets new friends (i.e., Maki, Feliz and Hoze, and later, Eddie, Avel, Carlos and Javier) who help direct him to travel to Peru and explore drugs and shamanism. Finally, we see him five years later as a patient taking schizophrenia medications in a Tasmanian mental hospital.</p>
<p>The main TPW in the book medium is represented by the protagonist’s thoughts and feelings expressed by verbal text and images. The multimodal comic presents the verbal text as coming directly from Polaxis’s mind, whereas the images place the reader in a position to observe Polaxis from the outside. Nevertheless, as readers are led to believe that the diary is both written and drawn by Polaxis, the images somehow still represent his perspective. The drawings in the book are, to some extent, realistic (although often both symbolic and exaggerated), contributing to the TAW of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  standing out as a complete world, where the subjective world of Polaxis is embedded in what Ryan characterizes as an  “entire universe”  that contains  “not only an actual world of narrative facts, but a multitude of possible worlds created by the mental activity of the characters”   <sup id="fnref10:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  is presented as Polaxis’s diary, the TAW and the TPW are closely intertwined; the TPW of Polaxis’s memories, beliefs and ideas appear as the narrative’s driving force. Hence, the accessibility relations between TAW and TPW are necessary for understanding Polaxis’s actions and reactions. In other cases, the connections are possible, since the allusions to drug abuse and disillusions are possible explanations of how he sees the world. Other explanations, such as time splitting <sup id="fnref4:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, transmigration <sup id="fnref5:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> or living in a fifth-dimensional hologram <sup id="fnref6:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, represent accessibility relations that seem impossible or radically increase the distance from the reader’s actual world.</p>
<p>The AR app presents another possible world that complicates the storyworld of  <em>Modern Polaxis: the</em>  so-called  <em>hidden</em>  journal of Polaxis. On one hand, the hidden journal in the AR layer may be seen as a description of a parallel world named Intafrag, but on the other hand, it may be seen as a mental possible world created by the main character’s delusions and paranoia. This question remains open throughout the entire story, although the last image, in which central characters are placed in a mental institution, might suggest the latter. The reader may see this plot’s driving forces as the adventurous desires of youth gone wrong and/or as developing a psychiatric diagnosis. However, because of this uncertainty, the TPW represented by the AR layer may ultimately challenge what may represent the TAW, thus raising doubts about the ontological statuses of all worlds of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  — in line with the philosophical framing of the cave allegory.</p>
<h2 id="the-worlds-of--_modern-polaxis_--unfolding-in-time-and-space">The worlds of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  unfolding in time and space</h2>
<p>In this section, we look closely at how Modern Polaxis’s storyworld unfolds in time and space and how differences in these dimensions create tensions between the worlds. Table 1 summarises the stated times in the work and the places that Polaxis visits at these points in time. A turning point in the story is marked with the heading  “RIP Polaxis of the past for this statue is dedicated to the Polaxis of the future”   <sup id="fnref7:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This marks the beginning of Polaxis’s travels and a new way of perceiving time and space, and the book’s verbal text states that  “a new reality begins” .</p>
<p>Only some events are accurately dated, and there are significant gaps in the story. The dates do not seem to differ much between the book and app, except for once, when the in-flight magazine says 2 July <sup id="fnref8:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, and the journal entry <sup id="fnref9:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> states 29 June. This would not be strange if the time difference were the other way around, with the date on the magazine being before the date Polaxis wrote about the flight. The fact that time seems to turn backwards represents a gap that might refer to time travel.<br>

The first part <sup id="fnref10:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> tells the story of Polaxis’s past in retrospect and gradually reveals his background up to the point when the story is being told. This is where his connection to Intafrag and the fear of its agents is first established in the AR layer <sup id="fnref11:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The story about the Polaxis of the future, the  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , is told in the present tense and moves chronologically forward in time from the party in Montreal in February 2009 to Polaxis’s experiences in Peru and the Amazon in June/July 2009 (except for the logical gap between the flight and magazine dates). Then there is a flashback to February 2009, followed by a five-year leap at the end to the mental hospital.</p>
<p>In Table 1, we see how changes in time and place move quickly forward from page to page in some phases, while there are mainly two phases where time seems to come to a halt: one in Polaxis’s past and one in his future. This may be seen as ontological gaps in time that constitute indeterminacies in the fabula. The first appears as a dream triggered by the introduction of the concept of  “time binding”   <sup id="fnref12:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Here, Polaxis recollects a sensation of burning in the book TPW and being chased by Intafrag agents through dark alleys in the app. In the book layer he refers to the experience as  “transcendence. Time splits in two”   <sup id="fnref13:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>,  “the breakdown of cells into light”   <sup id="fnref14:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>,  “transmigration”  and  “Mind + Body transfer”   <sup id="fnref15:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. As the process accelerates, the AR layer adds no words <sup id="fnref16:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> but instead intensifies the experience with swirling movements and scary sounds. These memories from the past explain what happens to the  “Polaxis of the future”   <sup id="fnref17:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. These incidents may represent corresponding ontological gaps in the two TPWs.</p>
<p>Another example of ontological gaps in the TPWs is a corresponding experience of a time in the future when Polaxis travels from Montreal to Lima. The spaces of the airplane and bus seem to overlap <sup id="fnref18:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and immediately follow the confusing experience of time going backwards (from 2 July to 29 June). Hence, neither time nor space is perceived as stable:  “My position&hellip;Is not stable…”   <sup id="fnref19:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. In the AR layer, this experience is presented as a  “time fold”  (a portal between two overlapping realities) <sup id="fnref20:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The following events include Polaxis’s experience in Peru, which has been given a double explanation. He is invited to try Ayahuasca,  “a psychoactive homebrew traditionally prepared by Amazonians for the purpose of healing the body of toxins and interfacing with the divine”   <sup id="fnref21:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, and he joins the ceremony led by the shaman Javier in the Pisac sacred valley <sup id="fnref22:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. On page 46 in the book, the lost journal entry connects back to 7 February in Montreal, and the AR layer connects these two timeless phases with the word  “purge” .</p>
<p>These experiences of time coming to a halt represent ontological gaps or indeterminacies in the storyworld across book and app. The main difference concerning the time perception between the analogue and digital layers is that the time gaps in the book seem like normal gaps in time. The reader will not perceive the changes in time and place as missing information, but as events that have occurred but are not told. In the digital layer, however, these gaps are explained as actual time travel, occasionally jumping between places. When, in the end, Polaxis is in the mental hospital, he refers to an incident in Montreal five years earlier:  “The blow to my head knocked me unconscious. I was out long enough for the plant creatures to time-bind me to this reality”   <sup id="fnref23:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. It is as if those five years never actually transpired. Hence, there is a conflict between accessibility relations and the timeline of the book and the app, respectively. The alternate timeline of the AR layer represents a transposition that may challenge the storyworld’s logical consistency, according to Ryan <sup id="fnref11:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The places where Polaxis visits seem to vary more between the analogue and digital layers than the time references. As Løvlie <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> explained,  “the concept of  place  should not only be treated as a physical location in space, but also as a psychological, social and cultural phenomenon (…)  places  are spaces that are valued” . This is relevant to the relations between narrative spaces in the worlds of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> . It seems that the places in the two different layers carry different values, even though the physical locations of both are mostly the same. The colours, sounds and animations of the AR layer reinforce the notion of being in a different place, as do the people inhabiting the two different layers when changing their personalities from the analogue to the digital medium. These changes are ontological gaps, creating uncertainty between the two layers.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Theory section, relations to storyworlds can be verified in the actual world; they can be possible or impossible. In  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , references to placenames that can be verified in the actual world are overrepresented in the book version. Many of the actions, especially in the book version, are possible, for example, the travels, alcohol and drug abuse and the parties. However, the connection to Intafrag and the Intafrag agents is impossible if delusions are not taken into account. The main level of possible references and real-life references is represented by the book, whereas the impossible is represented largely by the app. Moreover, the illegal actions concerning the actual world, such as drug abuse, are not hidden in the journal, which perhaps indicates it is not the police or other authorities that the journal is hidden from; rather, the main character in his paranoia hides it from the representatives of Intafrag.</p>
<p>The question of the distance between the world of the readers and Polaxis’s world is not straightforward. It depends on which world is taken as a point of departure. The idea of the parallel world of Intafrag contributes to the distancing of the entire storyworld from the actual world of the reader. Even so, there is a question of whether the experiences of the TPW in the AR layer, the Intafrag experiences, should be seen as real experiences or as delusions caused by drug abuse. The notion of drug experiences has a much shorter distance from the real world than a parallel universe, even considering that some readers may believe in parallel worlds. Ryan <sup id="fnref12:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> states that  “ghost stories could be credible for people who believe in the occult.”  However, such beliefs are not mainstream, and because of that, if Intafrag is seen as a result of paranoia and delusions, the distance from the real world is much shorter.</p>
<p>The distance between the PWs of the AR layer and the book can be illustrated by looking for verbal references that occur only in the app, and that may even seem impossible in the TAW. Words that appear only in the app are  “Intafrag”  (15 times) and  “creatures”  (23 times). The word  “key,”  referring to entering Intafrag, is only mentioned in the app. Furthermore,  “agent(s)”  appears frequently in the app version but is only mentioned three times in the book. These words connect directly to the world of Intafrag and are not compatible with what would be considered the ontological rules of the TAW. Polaxis’s diary, where he expresses his experiences and thoughts in the book layer, is hence closer to the TAW than the AR layer, which is said to be his secret diary.</p>
<p>Visually, certain symbols or objects of symbolic value also serve to establish relationships between the TPWs. For example, a triangle first appears on page four and in the AR layer is emphasised by blinking colours. Later, it reappears on a pendant <sup id="fnref24:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, which is later described as an anchor point <sup id="fnref25:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. These objects play an essential role in time binding, which is reminiscent of Korzybski’s theory of how memories may be transferred by using symbols, perhaps indicating a connection between movement in time and space and inner perception (memories).</p>
<p>Polaxis is haunted by the ambivalence of having friends but distrusting them, as he is insecure about whether they are, in fact, friends or disguised Intafrag agents. In the book, many characters seem to be fellow travellers whom Polaxis incidentally meets. However, the AR layer reveals their relations to Intafrag. For instance, on the last page, in the image from the mental hospital, the characters Maki and Hoze appear to be sitting next to Polaxis on a bench. In the AR layer, however, their faces are crossed out while the verbal text states,  “This is not Maki or Hoze. They’re Intafrag agents sent here to monitor me”   <sup id="fnref26:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. On the same page, Dr. Affeldt is labelled a  “neuropsychiatrist”  in both the book and AR layers, while earlier, his name and profession were only revealed in the AR layer. Then he was presented as the founder of time-binding theory who tried to find a  “synthesis of the first chemical agent to disrupt Intafrag”   <sup id="fnref27:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Hence, Polaxis’s early suspicions of being a test subject in the AR layer are explained in the book layer by Dr. Affeldt, asking him to take his schizophrenia medication <sup id="fnref28:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At the house party in Montreal, a drug dealer named Feliz appears, and the verbal text in the book describes him as a  “dapper-looking fellow”   <sup id="fnref29:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, whereas in the AR layer, he is revealed as a gatekeeper holding  “several ancient keys to enter Intafrag”   <sup id="fnref30:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Eddie, who is a character that Polaxis meets on his way to Peru, has connections to Intafrag in the app layer, but he is oblivious to his Intafrag experiences, which only Polaxis can see <sup id="fnref31:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. In the AR layer, normal people attending a shaman ceremony in Peru become strange green creatures from Intafrag and so on. Hence, the people who inhabit the worlds of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  are not easily trusted. These people, even if radically changing their roles in the story, also connect the TPW of the AR layer with the worlds of the book layer. Nevertheless, there are always some relations that remain the same, reminding the reader that the layers are part of the same story.</p>
<p>According to Ryan <sup id="fnref13:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, some fictions create worlds with ontological gaps. Ontological completeness presupposes that  “for every contradictory pair of propositions, one must be true and another false in that world”   <sup id="fnref14:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. In  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , the references to Intafrag may, for the reader, represent an ontological gap in the storyworld; however, from the viewpoint of the main character, Intafrag is the only truth maintained throughout this story. Consequently, Polaxis’s ontological doubts are about how people and events in his actual world are related to (or infiltrated by) Intafrag. Perhaps the possible worlds of the book and the AR layers are ontologically different, but they are still two sides of the same storyworld, according to the main character. Still, there is a question of how this affects the TAW. In the case of a parallel universe, it would connect to the TAW on a more profound level than in the case of being a purely mental possible world. The story’s philosophical framing poses the radical question of what is real. If the parallel universe of Intafrag is given priority, this radically changes the understanding of the TAW, altering propositions from true to false.</p>
<p>To explore how different worlds may be perceived by the reader, the next section presents a reader-oriented perspective on the simultaneous experiences of the partly conflicting possible worlds depicted in  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> .</p>
<h2 id="reading--_modern-polaxis_">Reading  <em>Modern Polaxis</em></h2>
<p>The literary experience of an AR work differs from reading a traditional book and other kinds of digital literature by simultaneously offering two different sides of the story. Physically, when reading  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , it is possible to read the book first and then use the app to read a different version of the story. We expect readers to read the book and app in parallel, first reading a page in the book and then seeing what the app reveals. Seeing the story change while reading is one thrill of the AR app. It is also crucial to understand the work as a whole. This is one storyworld unfolding in two different layers transpiring simultaneously. The starting point is that the aesthetic work comes to life through the act of reading <sup id="fnref2:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>, which is experienced through the senses and ultimately activates the reader’s imagination.</p>
<h2 id="fiction-imagination-and-sensory-experience">Fiction, imagination and sensory experience</h2>
<p>Fictional narratives invite interpretive work that caters to the imagination. As Ryan <sup id="fnref15:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> claims,  “when a text creates a storyworld,  <em>we imagine that there is more to this world than what the text represents</em> .”  As mentioned in the Theory section, reading fiction includes a triad of fictionalising acts <sup id="fnref4:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>: the fictive, the real and the imaginary brought together by the readers’ interaction with the text. Certain elements in  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  expand the possibilities for imagination; for instance, the people whom Polaxis meets are genuinely mysterious, and how he reaches some places in his travels is unclear. This applies to both analogue and digital layers. One might assume that adding information automatically narrows the possibilities for the reader’s imagination. However, Intafrag creates a new space for imaginative deduction and spatial immersion. In this way,  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  opens itself up for the reader to create a more complex storyworld based on their imagination, thus providing space for the reader’s uncertainties and ambivalences in line with Polaxis’s experience of being in the world.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of how the interplay between worlds in AR literature may affect the reader’s literary experience, we explore this through Iser’s <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> concept of aesthetic response. Iser connects aesthetics with perception and sees the aesthetic effect as a form of realisation stemming from the human senses. This view on aesthetics reflects the etymological meaning of the Greek word, aísthēsis – sensation. When reading AR literature, the physical sensory experience is simultaneously perceived in both analogue and digital layers, which creates the potential for a multitude of connections between what the senses perceive and how this translates to an act of immersion and inner experience.</p>
<p>The two TWPs may be seen in light of the platonic question raised at the beginning of the story. Which world is apprehended as the most real world, the one closest to the TAW, as they are both materialised in the physically touchable book or the alternate, mental one? The world in the book layer is generally less colourful than in the digital layer. The digital layer adds perceivable differences, such as colour, movement, sound and sometimes picture-like elements. The visual impressions in the app layer are perceived as more salient than the book’s visual expressions due to the colourfulness and movement. Adding the digital layer changes the visual style, in this case giving more emphasis to affect <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> and hence providing potentials for the readers’ emotional immersion. The liveliness of the AR layer might indicate that this is the most real part of the story. To complicate this, however, the analogue layer is touchable and concrete, whereas the digital layer is volatile and intangible.</p>
<p>As an example of this layered reading experience, we will have a closer look at the episode in which Polaxis travels from Montreal to Lima, following the ontological gap where time seems to move backwards, as described in the previous section. Pages 27-28 are part of this travel, describing Polaxis on the bus in Peru <sup id="fnref32:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and what he sees as the bus stops <sup id="fnref33:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On page 27, Polaxis is depicted on a bus, stating it could be anywhere. He falls asleep and wakes up  “somewhere else” , which turns out to be Peru. Throughout the comic book the background is white and cross ruled, alluding to Polaxis’s diary being jotted down in a notebook. The image is rather detailed, but a line drawing. On this page the verbiage is in white on black background. There are drawings depicting a chaotic mess, including elements resembling tentacles and branches, over and under the outline of Polaxis on the bus. The page can be read as a comics page divided in three panels horizontally, in which the upper and lower panel represent a chaos foreshadowing the monster on the next page.</p>
<p>As the AR layer is projected upon the book page, colours appear in the bus window displaying a photographic image of mountains in motion, to indicate that the bus is driving. When looking closely, green, huge, monster-like creatures with long thin insect-like legs emerge in the mountain landscape. The predominantly green monsters connote the green Martians of past times science fiction, perhaps pointing to the outer worldly of a parallel universe. The sound of a vehicle (the bus) merges with strange sounds, perhaps guttural sounds from the monsters, and sounds of large rocks falling. The sounds create feelings of great unease and may be perceived as scary. This is however an interpretation; it is the reader’s starting point in the principle of minimal departure <sup id="fnref3:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> that makes the reader perceive the engine-like noises and the moving image as the bus moving. The photographic image in the AR layer brings the representation closer to the real world of the reader, hence questioning the ontology of the TAW of the book. The green monsters, however, appear hand drawn, perhaps leading the reader to think that they are a product of Polaxis’s imagination. Projecting the AR layer, the colour of the letters shifts from white to red, making them pop out, which in turn gives them a greater semantic load. Polaxis in the AR layer says he closed his eyes on the plane and ended up on the bus, that his position is not stable and that he sees  “strange shapes”  in the distance, presumably referring to the monster-like creatures only visible in this layer. It is up to the reader to draw connections between the book and the AR- layer. The indeterminacy lies in which layer to believe in. Are the monsters products of Polaxis’s imagination, as they are not present in the original  “hand-written”  book? What is the origin of the soundscape? These are fundamental tasks of interpretation for the readers to solve through their imagination. What is specific for comics reading is the interpretative work of closure that happens when the reader draws connections between panels. Adding the AR layer expands this reading space by adding a new kind of gutter between book and app.</p>
<p>On the opposite page, the text states Cusco, Peru, July 2nd 2009. Words and image in the book describe a rather mundane situation of the bus stopping in the Andes, and construction workers building new roads and installing a traffic light system, which Polaxis finds strange, as the place is quite rural and he states that there is no traffic. A red, thin handwriting on the left reads:  “Every [man]<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  wants to see”  and this sentence seems to be continued on the right with  “the ancient world!”</p>
<p>When the AR layer is projected, a large monster appears, resembling the monsters on the previous page. The animated monster is multi-coloured, but mainly green, and it is not possible to identify its face or body parts. It seems to have tentacles rather than humanlike limbs. The men in the picture who are raising traffic lights in the book version now seem to try to control the monster. The sounds resemble roars, presumably from the monster, along with distant human voices. It is not possible to make out what the voices say, and again it is the principle of minimal departure that makes the reader understand these sounds as human voices from the workers. The red letters stating  “every man wants to see”  now say  “Intafrag” . They turn turquoise with a red background and are surrounded by lots of spinning arrows, as if symbolising confusion or a compass that is not working. This is an example of the explicit Intafrag references in the AR layer. The verbal text on the top of the page reveals that Polaxis does indeed feel confused, wondering whether what he sees is hallucinations, or whether he actually sees Intafrag. There is an evident void between the perceiving of a mundane, but odd situation in a street, and the revealed monster of the AR-layer. How the layers are connected, is a question of interpretation, where the perspective taken by the main character is only one of many options. The soundscapes and visual layers of AR create unease, merging the sounds of humans and engines with undefinable roars; and the colours, movements and landscapes of the actual world with the hand drawings of the monster. The AR layer questions the ontology of the textual worlds of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  because these elements bring the static situation in the notebook to life.</p>
<p>The experience of reading this AR comic represents new ways of viewing the relations between the real and the virtual <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. Touching the book while using the app maintains the physical sense of the book medium, while at the same time sensing the AR layer being projected over your hands. The app is transitory, it is only seen and heard when swiping over a page; as opposed to the physically stable book, which can be moved from one place to another without pictures and verbal text disappearing. The touchable book is held against the stronger visual (i.e., colours, movement, etc.) and audible experiences of the app. These sensory experiences underline and thematise the question of what is real or what we may know about the world rather than providing an answer.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-of-interpretation">The game of interpretation</h2>
<p>Gaps for the reader to fill in the text occur when text segments are indirectly connected and can break the expected order in the text <sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. Indeterminacies require the reader to make individual decisions on textual meanings. Even if there are several connections between the analogue and digital layers, there are also gaps between them. The main gap consists of the lack of explanation regarding the layers’ differences, raising the question of what is real. An interesting aspect of the gaps in time is that, according to traditional storytelling, they are perceived in the book as gaps for the reader to fill, whereas the digital layer insists on explaining the gaps with time travelling. This repeats the question of what is delusional and what is real. In this uncertainty, the reader participates in the main character’s delusions and his struggle to be in two worlds simultaneously. This distance and tension between the two layers may cause the reader to feel a sense of insecurity.</p>
<p>The tension between the layers is a driving force in the story. The reader’s curiosity is driven by revealing the differences between the layers, rather than by being immersed in the actual story, which is not very causally driven. This is a form of indeterminacy that seems related to the interpretative work of closure in comics reading. There is little explanation for why the events occur and the information on characters other than Polaxis is very limited. Polaxis himself has a past that is only vaguely elaborated, for instance, with an ex-girlfriend who appears only in a flash. The mundane, the usual and everyday aspects of life, are not emphasised in the work, nor is the causality between events. Mystery surrounds Polaxis, and the reader gets a first-hand impression of his insecurity, estrangement, existential anxiety and uneasiness. The work renders the impression of having access to someone’s delusional and paranoid mind as if the readers are getting to see something that is not for them to see.</p>
<p>The line of events may not be as interesting as the way the app makes the reader feel. This feeling of estrangement and uneasiness constitutes a common ground for the analogue and digital TPWs. Polaxis does not seem to feel comfortable in any of these worlds. This may be seen in connection to the modern in the  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  story. The modernist feeling is that of estrangement, existential anxiety and uneasiness. The threats in the app come from the Intafrag agents, but Polaxis does not seem to find the real world very appealing either. He wishes to travel through time and space, which is what he simultaneously fears. In a way, he is lost in both worlds.</p>
<p>Polaxis is presented as a human in a human world and thereby ontologically like the reader, which is a prerequisite for immersion <sup id="fnref16:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. However, the potential discrepancy between Polaxis’s and the reader’s views of Intafrag makes  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  a work that does not effortlessly provide immersion. This is because Polaxis is not necessarily a character with whom the reader identifies. However, the emotional state of uncertainty and vulnerability, mainly emphasised in the AR layer, may invite identification and emotional immersion. Even if the feeling of estrangement is a general human experience of the modern, it might be said to connect to the story’s psychological dimension. Anxiety and unease are also commonly associated with psychological conditions that sometimes need professional treatment. According to this view, the TPWs constitute both opposites and mutual preconditions for interpretation.</p>
<p>The narrative possibilities for tensions between the worlds in the case of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  counteract the human pull towards everything adding up in the end. The AR layer questions whether the Intafrag notions are only manifestations of the protagonist’s delusions or whether they are, in fact, real. The latter acts against the conclusion implied in the end when Polaxis is in a mental hospital. The aesthetic experience of the work, namely frustration and feelings of alienation and unease, lies in this counteraction. Since the narrative is difficult to follow, it requires the reader’s concentration. Ryan <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> defined concentration as a type of  “attention devoted to difficult, non-immersive works” . It is possible, however, to have an experience of the app without understanding the full story. Perhaps the aesthetic experience of unease is even stronger than the actual narration of events.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>In this section, we discuss more generally how AR can contribute to literary experiences. AR can enhance experiences with sound, colours and animations, but what can AR contribute beyond pop-up-like environments with sound effects <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Does this technology have the potential to enrich literary experiences in more profound ways? First, we will look at AR contributions in terms of Ryan’s <sup id="fnref17:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> transfictional operations: extension, modification and transposition. Then, we discuss some differences between location-based and object-based AR and, lastly, the potentials concerning the degree of interactivity in AR works.</p>
<p><em>Extension</em>  is a transfictional operation that  “adds new stories to the fictional world while respecting the facts established in the original”   <sup id="fnref18:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. These additional story elements may be more or less true to and more or less consistent with the TAW. AR also has the potential to expand storytelling experiences by blending fictional worlds with the reader’s actual world. In AR stories, such as those of  <em>Wonderscope</em> , users may see the room they are in or even their hands merging into the story. This draws the reader closer to the narrative and invites empathy for the characters. In other cases, ambivalence may result from the interplay between the layers, or the layers may be polarised by providing alternative viewpoints and perspectives <sup id="fnref3:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>, as we see in the  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  story. Whether the aim is to deepen the feeling of closeness and empathy or to open new, surprising narrative spaces, AR contributes to the storyworld’s extension and elaboration.</p>
<p>In contrast to extension, modification more radically changes the original narrative’s plot <sup id="fnref19:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. These changes may concern the characters’ behaviours and missions, as in the case of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , or modify how events play out and ultimately change the ending that feeds back in one’s interpretation of the entire story. In sum, the layers may offer alternative plotlines or more or less elaborate courses of events. Transposition entails a plot moving into a different temporal or spatial setting <sup id="fnref20:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Here, AR may offer new possibilities across the narrative dimensions of time and space. Time leaps may occur in narratives across media, such as books, films and theatre, but the possibility of operating in different times and places in the simultaneous display of analogue and digital layers may be specific to AR technology. More generally, AR may inspire a broad range of interplay between parallel or contrasting timeframes; for example, an AR story with historical events in one layer and something resembling the present day in the other (or present-day versus the future, or any other combination).</p>
<p>The complexity of space being simultaneously perceived in two different layers is AR-specific. The AR layer may extend and elaborate the textual worlds in terms of new information and additional modes of expression, such as colour, movement and sound. The layers may also display more separate possible worlds than in  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , thus inviting the creation of stories in parallel or contrasting worlds. Such choices may invite a great variety of options for spatial immersion. Spatial transpositions seem vital to AR technology.</p>
<p>The interplay between the AR layer and a physical object or a geographical, spatial reality is unique to the AR experience <sup id="fnref3:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. The merging of a digital layer with the physical reality in which the reader’s body is located, is perceived differently through AR work than in other media. This adds to the relevance of PW theory, as the complexity of textual possible worlds plays out in different layers simultaneously. The AR layer can express both closeness and distance to the TAW; in the case of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , AR contributes to distancing the reader from the TAW. This interplay between different dimensions or worlds has significant potential for expanding the storyworld. The potential complexity of the interplay between worlds seems extensive through the combination of the physical and AR layers. However, one could also imagine a less complex relationship between the analogue and the digital. The PW of the AR layer may support or subvert the premises of other textual worlds.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, AR has the potential to play with both surroundings and artefacts. In this respect, there is a difference between space-oriented and object-oriented works. In location-based works, the opportunity arises to exploit the fact that the user must move physically from one place to another, which influences their experience of the story. In object-based AR, one can envision endless possibilities in the choice of objects onto which the story is projected, moving far beyond the traditional comic book medium employed in  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> . One example is the  <em>Merge Cube</em> , formed like a giant dice that fits in your hand, onto which the multilinear AR story  <em>57° North</em>  is projected; however, the potential is not utilised in this app, where turning the cube has much the same function as turning a book page. The potential for further development appears to be extensive, with stories yet to be told.</p>
<p>While interactivity in  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  is kept to a minimum, the possibilities for interactions in terms of tasks for the reader to solve or paths to choose in AR work seem endless. Using interactivity in narrative apps carries potentials to expand aesthetic experiences in several ways <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. The already complex combination of AR and the actual and possible worlds of the story may be additionally augmented through the creative use of interactivity.</p>
<p>Topics about location-based AR and interactivity could be extended to future research on AR narratives. For this paper, we have merely touched upon some of the possibilities that lie in an approach based in narratology and possible world theory. Further research on AR and aesthetic experiences, could broaden this perspective with insights from multimodal theory or game studies, which would expand the understanding of how AR literature works.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The analysis of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  shows how AR can contribute to aesthetic experiences through the parallel structure — the simultaneous sensation of the story’s different layers that cannot be experienced in a format other than AR. The potential complexities of reading AR comics may be understood as an extension of the two dimensions characteristic of comics discussed by Scott McCloud <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>: The juxtaposition of panels, as well as that of words and images. McCloud categorises six kinds of transitions between panels, of which action-to-action is the dominant in comics within western culture. Interestingly, he finds cultural differences, where aspect-to-aspect transitions are more common in comics from Eastern culture (Japan). This kind of transition  “bypasses time for the most sake and set a wandering eye on different aspects of a place, idea or mood”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. As we have pointed out in the analysis, the interpretative work of closure that is involved in connecting what happens in a sequence of panels across gutters, is multiplied in reading AR comics. Adding the AR layer may work as a new kind of gutter. In the case of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , this contributes primarily to the mood by elaborating different aspects of the storyworld.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in AR comics the digital layer caters for including new modes such as sound and animation to the words and images in printed comics. These are experienced simultaneously, and may expand, modify, transpose, or even contradict the printed story. The simultaneous merging of layers carries a specific potential for elaborating the emotional immersion in the story, rather than the sequence of actions unfolding in time. Hence the AR layer may be particularly interesting as it complements sequential art with nuances, paradoxes and embodied experience through a fuller multimodal orchestration.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for such potential expansions in time and space to be successful in augmenting the story told, rather than disturbing the narrative drive or displacing attention from meaning to form, is that the AR layer is consistently integrated in the story, as Helms points out <sup id="fnref3:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. In the case of  <em>Modern Polaxis</em> , the AR layer affects every spread throughout the story, and this playing with worlds is thematically justified by framing the story with Plato’s allegory of the cave. It may be no coincidence that we find such a thorough AR strategy in a unique, stand-alone story, written, illustrated and animated by one artist, in close cooperation with programmer and musical composer.</p>
<p>As implied in our discussion, these insights from reading  <em>Modern Polaxis</em>  may transfer to other kinds of AR literature through an understanding of panels, gutters and layers as spaces of interpretation. In Wolfgang Iser’s more general theory of aesthetic response, this experience of connecting events over time and space, can be seen as gaps, blanks and indeterminacies, which invite the reader into the work of interpretation by connecting syntagmatic combination with paradigmatic selection. This opens possibilities for telling multifaceted, complex stories, and this complexity is sensed through AR technology and at least partly driven and caused by it. In simultaneously displayed layers lie possibilities for unique aesthetic experiences. Hence, AR may contribute to complex storyworlds by presenting possible worlds in different layers and exploiting the spatial complexity of textual worlds specific to AR. The reader’s literary experiences may be correspondingly complex, as the narrative worlds expand and reach beyond the reader’s previous literary experiences.</p>
<p>On a more general note, we could say that the relations between levels of reality in AR fiction remind us of the challenges of interpretation. Iser <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> claims that any interpretation opens a liminal space, and he connects a poetic quality <sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> to this  “space between”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. He sees interpretation as a dynamic process where this space invites the reader to perform new meaning. We find that this awareness of the game of interpretation is amplified by the layered structure of AR narratives. The core of the AR function lies in the different aesthetic perceptions of the layers, as well as in the differences and tensions of the layers, the gaps between them, and despite all of this, their creation of a common ground for interpretation.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sick and infirm patients on crutches and in wheelchairs ( “Bath chairs” ) race down a grassy hill as spectators cheer them along. At the top of the hill, the start of the race is labelled  “Cripples Corner”  and represents The Crescent; the city of Bath is outlined in the distance.<br>
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br>
So reads the Summary field of the Lewis Walpole Library’s catalogue entry for Thomas Rowlandson’s  <em>Bath Races</em>  (see Figure 1), a satirical print published in London by Thomas Tegg in 1810. This description was written in 2009.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  It is simple, clear, and informative, and is part of a catalogue record that records a physical description of the object, transcribes its inscriptions, and categorises it by genre and topic. The record, including its free text description, was created by the Lewis Walpole Library but it was not created in a vacuum. Rather - like any catalogue record - it was shaped by the circumstances of its production.</p>

<p>One such circumstance is previous cataloguing. In the process of producing their records, cataloguers will typically consult earlier related records when they are available. For any cataloguer working on Golden Age satirical prints, prints like  <em>Bath Races</em> , Mary Dorothy George’s work on the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum</em>  (hereafter the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> ) has long been an essential point of reference. Spanning seven volumes published between 1935 and 1954 they are a classic of the genre such that once the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em>  became out of print, demand for the catalogues remained and they were republished as microfilm in 1978 by Chadwyck-Healey. More recently, lightly edited versions of George’s descriptions have been published on the British Museum Collections Online website, which launched in 2009 and contains entries for over 11,000 prints described by George in the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> , including  <em>Bath Races</em> .</p>
<p>In the case of the Lewis Walpole Library’s entry for  <em>Bath Races</em> , we know that the corresponding record in  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em>  and its later derivations at British Museum Collections Online influenced the content of the record: George’s volume is cited and the web version of the object description is quoted.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  But there is more to the story here than a nod to a respected forbear. In their production of a description of  <em>Bath Races</em> , the cataloguers behind the Lewis Walpole description were influenced by the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> , or - to use Michael Baxandall’s [<a href="#baxandall1985">1985</a>] more active formulations of creative influence - they drew on, engaged with, reacted to, differentiated from, remodeled, developed, tackled, even subverted George’s description. Thus, where George calls the protagonists Cripples and invalids, the Lewis Walpole Library entry calls them  “Sick and infirm patients on crutches and in wheelchairs;”  where George has the patients  “rush[ing] down a hill,”  the Lewis Walpole Library entry has them  “rac[ing] down a grassy hill;”  where George sees  “Young women cheer[ing] on the competitors,”  the Lewis Walpole Library entry sees  “spectators cheer[ing] them along.”  By taking the structure of George’s description but deviating from its now judgemental tone, those who produced the Lewis Walpole Library’s catalogue entry transmitted aspects of George’s curatorial voice across time and space, even as they worked to tackle or subvert George’s linguistic choices.</p>
<p>We start, then, from the position that digitised and digital legacy catalogues entries like these should, assembled at scale, be recognised as highly valuable resources for generating important new knowledge about cataloguing and curatorial practices, their histories, and their consequences. At the same time we respond to the calls (e.g. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>) to recover the motivations behind classification and its impact on the fabric of knowledge when classification systems like legacy catalogues become further uncoupled from their circumstances of production, such as - in our case - as a result of digitisation. Further, we observe that this uncoupling can produce negative effects when  “the future that an algorithmic system can predict is limited by the historical data used to train that system”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Our concerns with historicizing the catalogue thus intersect with important cross-disciplinary and inter-sectoral research on cultural institutions and power <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, histories of anglophone cataloguing <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, and metadata <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The catalogue records we seek to historicize underpin the audit, curatorial, and public access functions of collecting institutions. And they are relied upon by many humanities researchers: consider the historian searching archival materials, the literary scholar collating a corpus of books, or the art historian identifying and analysing relevant prints. In these contexts, we argue that it is important to recognise that catalogues are the products of curatorial and cataloguing labour, often spanning many decades, and they are shaped by earlier catalogues, by shifting curatorial and cataloguing practices and priorities, and by broader social circumstances and cultures <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Thus many catalogues comprise subsets of records written at different times, by different people, according to different principles and goals. This situation is exacerbated in those cases where parts of an earlier catalogue are incorporated into a new catalogue. This means that far from a neutral record of collection holdings, catalogues are subject to various biases and inequities, which impact in problematic and potentially unknown ways on how they are used.</p>
<p>Crucially, the historically specific labours and practices of catalogue production are all too easily obscured by the presentation of the catalogue as an always-already present unifying entity, and are further obscured when collections are federated for access, into datasets, or as machine readable endpoints. Cataloguers, curators and researchers will be more or less familiar with the histories of the catalogues that they work with. Hence, to some extent, they will be able to account for how specific labours and practices resulted in particular emphases and absences, biases and inequities. However, such knowledge is often held in the heads of individuals or in annotations made to printed catalogues, and is based on interactions with certain parts of a catalogue. And whilst principles and best practices exist for documenting collections and producing catalogues, there is normally a lack of comprehensive documented information about their use in local cataloguing processes. In turn, collecting institutions have not found ways to make this information useable for publics, a move - as recent work has shown - that can foster anti-racist and anti-colonial practice <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Similarly, whilst some records of the production processes of a catalogue may exist, it is often necessary to work backwards from the contents of the current catalogue in order to understand its history, and even then the authors of many records will remain unknown and unknowable.</p>
<p>We contend that manifestations of the historically specific circumstances in which cataloguing takes place, from which biases/inequities arise in the form of linguistic and structural traces, are amenable to computational analysis and are more apparent when a catalogue is analysed at scale with support from computational techniques. Further we contend that by approaching catalogues as data we can generate knowledge about them that supports the writing of their histories, documenting their features when reproduced as datasets, and planning revisions that advance equity and social justice <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In previous work we demonstrated how linguistic and structural traces in catalogues manifest the curatorial voices of cataloguers and curators, and their institutions. By combining archival research and corpus linguistic analysis we analysed curatorial voice in over 9,000 descriptions of printed images from the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> , comprising around one million words <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. We were able to make a systematic account of how the catalogue descriptions included or omitted mentions of certain aspects of objects, how they varied in the degree to which they described or interpreted objects, and how they were shaped by the historically specific circumstances in which cataloguing labour took place. We argued that a computationally-derived characterisation of these choices could be usefully applied to current and future cataloguing practice: e.g. to develop or refine guidelines for object description, and to estimate the person time required to edit or enhance catalogue data.</p>
<p>The current paper is concerned with  <em>transmission</em>  from legacy catalogues to contemporary catalogues and thus builds on and complements the computational analysis of curatorial voice. By transmission we refer both to the incorporation of more or less edited catalogue records from a legacy catalogue into a contemporary catalogue, and to the stylistic influence of earlier cataloguing practice in the production of new records.</p>
<p>As a case study we take a catalogue comprising 16,669 records for printed images held by the Lewis Walpole Library, a research centre for eighteenth-century studies in the United States. These records were chosen because they represent a small-scale and well delimited collection containing free-text descriptions, and because we expected that those descriptions would show signs of transmission from the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> . The collections these records are based on, and that now form the Lewis Walpole Library, began to be assembled by Annie Burr and Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis in the early twentieth century. Documentation of the printed image collections accelerated in the mid-1950s, first with the production of over 12,000 catalogue cards by Annie Burr (officially Curator of Prints from 1957) and her voluntary assistant Elizabeth Creamer <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. After Annie Burr’s death in 1959 cataloguing labour was taken vigorously forward by Genevieve Butterfield <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. In 1980 the Lewis Walpole Library became part of Yale University, and from 2003 its collections catalogue was gradually integrated into Orbis, Yale’s digital library catalogue. Throughout this period the Lewis Walpole Library’s collections were added to and its catalogues updated, requiring particular curatorial and cataloguing expertise to manage and explain the printed image collections, from knowledge of the history of printing to methods for describing visual materials. For one subset of the printed image collections, satirical prints produced in England between the 1770s and 1830s, the Lewises and their staff based their cataloguing on Volumes 5 to 11 of the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> , transforming the entries these volumes contained, all of which were written by George, into index cards that detailed titles, persons, places, events, and keywords <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. These volumes were acquired by the Lewis Walpole Library between 1938 and 1970, annotated by the Lewises, and described by Wilmarth as invaluable. Subsequent cataloguers took this practice forward, drawing on the  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires _ and latterly their derivations on British Museum Collections Online.</p>
<p>This paper is about detecting and characterising the transmission of Mary Dorothy George’s voice through time, across space, and between mediums, from the 1930s to the late-twentieth century and beyond, from the British Museum in London to the Lewis Walpole Library in Farmington, Connecticut, from printed volumes to networked digital data.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  It aims to show how transmission happens, how it can be found, and how it can be characterised. The paper does not systematically analyse the biases and inequalities transmitted. Rather we examine the fact and the nature of transmission, taking transmission as a proxy for catalogue data that retains features produced under historically specific circumstances that were different - perhaps vastly so - from the circumstances in which that data has subsequently been used. We contend that such an investigation into if and how a catalogue is shaped by an earlier one is a vital step, because there are many domains where cataloguers like Mary Dorothy George are canonical influences, cataloguers who are persistent interlocuters between us and the pasts they described, legacy voices that refuse to stay in their historical place, and whose raced, sexed, and classed influence on the future should not go unchecked.</p>
<p>The contributions of this paper are novel computational approaches for detecting records that contain instances of transmission (Section 2) and for analysing these records in order to understand more about how transmission shaped a particular catalogue, and for elaborating general models of transmission (Section 3). The computational approaches are envisioned as part of an overall approach that frames catalogues as data, and that also relies on the expert knowledge of cataloguers and historical research in order to generate knowledge that can form the basis of work to understand, contextualise, and repair collection catalogues.</p>
<h2 id="2-detecting-instances-of-transmission">2. Detecting instances of transmission</h2>
<p>How can we systematically identify at scale those records in a digital (or digitised) catalogue that are likely to be the products of transmission from earlier catalogues? We present two computational approaches, both of which attempt to identify pertinent subsets of catalogue records based primarily on the content of certain fields in the records, rather than drawing primarily on extant knowledge about the catalogues and the collections they describe. The first approach (described in Section 2.1) should be quite generally applicable to other catalogues in the way it goes about identifying features that may be indicative of transmission. The second approach (described in Section 2.2) pertains to catalogues in which records contain relatively lengthy free-text descriptions of collection items. We show both here as applied to detecting the hypothesised transmission from the  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires _ to the Lewis Walpole Library’s catalogue. The outputs from these approaches - i.e. selections of records - are analysed in Section 3 in order to consider to what extent they are instances of transmission, and to explore what we can learn from them about the processes of transmission.</p>
<p>We acquired an export of 16,669 MARC 21<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  records from Orbis, Yale University’s online library catalogue,<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  selected by choosing all Lewis Walpole Library records with “k” (two-dimensional nonprojectable graphic) in the Leader - Type of Record field.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  To facilitate subsequent processing the exported XML file<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  was “parsed” such that for each pair of record ID and MARC field, all entries for that field in that record were placed on a tab-separated line comprising record ID, MARC field number, and list of entries for that field in that record.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  We also had access to a dataset -  <em>the BMSatire Descriptions corpus (BMSat)</em>  - comprising 9,330 descriptions based on entries in Volumes 5 to 11 of the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em>  that were written by George.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="21-using-features-from-various-marc-fields-to-select-sets-of-records">2.1 Using features from various MARC fields to select sets of records</h2>
<p>Our first approach to systematically identifying candidate records of transmission from  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires _ to the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue was to automatically generate overviews of the usage and content of the MARC fields across all the records from the Lewis Walpole Library Catalogue and then to manually scan the overviews for signs that particular fields in some records:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) explicitly cite the Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires;</li>
<li>(ii) contain evidence that the records could at least possibly be based on the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em>  in that they relate to objects of the same genre and period as described in the earlier catalogue, i.e. satirical prints from 1771-1832.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the 90 MARC fields used by the Lewis Walpole Library we generated an overview of our dataset that contained: a count of total instances of the field (there may be multiple instances per record); the average word count of the content of each field; a sample of up to 20 instances of the field; and eight frequency ordered ngram lists (1&lt;= n &lt;=8) generated from the content of the field after it was split on subfield tags<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> . Figure 2 shows a small part of the overview that was generated for MARC field 600 (Subject Added Entry-Personal Name), with a sample of four entries and the 10 most frequent trigrams. This overview of MARC field 600 shows evidence of point (ii), specifically: persons frequently associated with prints described in the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> ; associated date ranges that align with the publication dates (1771 to 1832) for prints George described; and subfields corresponding with the satirical print genre.</p>

<p>The most frequently occurring MARC field was 500 (General note) with 54,712 instances in the 16,669 records. The MARC fields that occurred more than 16,669 times (and hence potentially more than once in some records) were 655 (Index Term - Genre/Form), 650 (Subject Added Entry - Topical Term), 035 (System Control Number) and 300 (Physical Description). Field 245 (Title Statement) occurred exactly 16,669 times. The fields that occurred more than 8,000 times were 040 (Cataloging Source), 043 (Geographic Area Code), 099 (Local Call Numbers), 600 (Subject Added Entry - Personal Name), 700 (Added Entry - Personal Name), 260 (Publication, Distribution, etc. (Imprint)), 100 (Main Entry - Personal Name), 079 (encoding level), 510 (Citation / references note) and 520 (Summary, etc.). Of the remaining MARC fields, 59 of them occurred less than 1,000 times and - of those - 48 occurred less than 100 times.</p>
<p>We examined the overview for each of the fields guided by points (i) and (ii) above, starting with the statistics and sample entries. If these indicated anything potentially relevant, we scanned the most frequent n-grams. When an n-gram of interest was noted we then searched for it as part of longer n-grams and in the lists for other fields. Once we had narrowed our focus to specific “clues” in several fields we then analysed their contents in more detail. For example, having noted several ways in which British Museum registration numbers and BMSat numbers were written in the MARC fields 500 and 510, we wrote regular expressions to count in how many records these numbers were present.

<h2 id="211-selection-of-records-presumed-to-be-written-by-the-lewis-walpole-library">2.1.1 Selection of records presumed to be written by the Lewis Walpole Library</h2>
<p>In order to investigate the influence of the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> , and in particular Mary Dorothy George’s voice, on later cataloguing at the Lewis Walpole Library, for our first selection of records we created a corpus of descriptions from the MARC field 520 that - based on evidence from other MARC fields in the record - could not have been based directly on the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> . Specifically we aimed to select those Lewis Walpole Library records that describe satirical prints that are not in BMSat. Hence we selected all records that met all the following criteria: (i) the string ‘Satires (Visual Works)’ appears in the MARC 655 field, and/or ‘Caricatures and Cartoons’ appears in the MARC 600 field; (ii) in the MARC 500 and 510 fields there are no string matches for patterns that characterise the most common ways in which BMSat and British Museum registration numbers are written; (iii) the string ‘not in the catalogue of prints and drawings’ appears in the MARC 500 field (case insensitive matching); (iv) there are no matches for the string &rsquo; — british museum online catalogue&rsquo; in the MARC 520 field (case insensitive matching); and, (v) there is free text in the MARC 520 field but that free text is not enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<p>This gave 543 records. Based on subject knowledge and curatorial expertise we judged that 543 is reasonable as the number of satirical prints held by the Lewis Walpole Library that have narrative descriptions and no equivalent in the British Museum. Further, we checked if any of the 543 records indicated reuse of a description in a catalogue other than the  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires _ or of a dealer description (e.g. in an auction catalogue). Finally, we checked if any of the 543 records do in fact relate to printed images held by the British Museum, but escaped our tests, therefore making its MARC 520 field entry a potentially unattributed adaptation from the  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires _ or British Museum Collections Online. These checks revealed no issues, and so we subsequently made a corpus of descriptions that we are confident were written by staff at the Lewis Walpole Library without reference to the  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires; _ see Section 3.2 for analysis of this corpus.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="212-selection-of-records-that-refer-to-different-impressions-of-the-same-print">2.1.2 Selection of records that refer to different impressions of the same print</h2>
<p>The second selection of records that we made was based on the observation that different Lewis Walpole Library records mentioned the same BMSat number in either the MARC 500 or 510 fields. This indicates a phenomenon particular to catalogues of collections of printed images, whereby institutions hold multiple unique impressions, versions, states, or copies of the same printed image.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  Because these multiple impressions, versions, states, or copies of the same printed images may arrive at collecting institutions at different times, be catalogued by different individuals working in different institutional contexts, and are subject to different professional and scholarly influences, this raises the possibility that variation between catalogue records for the same image could support the investigation of transmission from BMSat to the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue by contrasting those records. For example, we might consider adjustments made to legacy descriptions in order to account for slight differences between collection objects, observe differing uses of BMSat as a source, or think through the possible rationale for and historical specificity of widely divergent descriptions.</p>
<p>We made a dataset that grouped descriptions from each set of Lewis Walpole Library records that refer to the same BMSat number.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  There are three groups with six Lewis Walpole Library records; four groups with five records; 11 groups with four records; 59 groups with three records; and 441 groups with two records. For an example, see Figure 4 which shows the contents of the MARC 520 field in four different Lewis Walpole Library records that all appear to refer to different impressions and copies of the same satirical print (BMSat 4050).<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  Note that the variations between the four descriptions take a variety of forms: a reference to a physical characteristic that differentiates the first description from the second; the common string  “On the table beside him are two;”  their similar lengths and points of emphasis. See Section 3.1 for the analysis of the selection of 1,123 records.</p>

<h2 id="22-using-a-text-distance-metric-to-find-pairs-of-related-descriptions-in-two-catalogues">2.2 Using a text distance metric to find pairs of related descriptions in two catalogues</h2>
<p>Our second approach to systematically identifying candidate records of transmission from the  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires _ to the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue addresses cases where the writing of descriptions in records has involved copying (parts of) descriptions from earlier catalogues with some degree of subsequent editing and/or addition of new text, but there is insufficient metadata to match up pairs of records from the two catalogues. To find these records we made pairwise comparisons of all the descriptions from one catalogue with all descriptions from the other using a text distance metric, and ranked the pairs of descriptions according to the metric. From this the pairs ranked as most similar (referred to as those with the lowest text distance) could be manually inspected as candidate examples of transmission.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>
<p>There are many different text distance metrics belonging to several families. We conducted trials to determine which is the most effective metric for our purposes, i.e. which most consistently ranks pairs of descriptions that are examples of transmission more highly than other pairs. We also considered how resource intensive the metrics are.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
<p>First, we hand-picked a set of fifteen pairs of descriptions that exhibited varying degrees of copying, editing, and addition, including pairs of descriptions that related to different collection items with similar content, and dissimilar pairs. We then generated results (in most cases text distance metrics) for each pair using sixteen of the functions that are implemented in the Python  <em>textdistance</em>  package,<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  with several from each of four families of function.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  Broadly speaking we observed the following.</p>
<p><strong>Edit-based metrics</strong>  (Hamming and Levenshtein): these metrics count how many character-level changes would be needed to change one string into another, so the higher the value of the metric the greater the difference between the two strings, i.e. values closer to zero would be suggestive of transmission. In most cases these metrics are not suitable for our purposes because the editing of descriptions often entails inserting or deleting words that shift the positions of many other characters, causing the edit distance to increase greatly even if the strings share much in common. For example, see Figure 5 for a pair of descriptions from the Lewis Walpole Library and BMSat respectively, which gave distances of 408 (Hamming) and 133 (Levenshtein) even though it would appear that the Lewis Walpole description is very much based on the one in BMSat.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  It seems that these metrics would only be effective in cases where very few edits were made or edits were direct replacements of single characters, e.g. if single quotation marks were replaced with double quotation marks throughout a description.</p>

<p>**Token-based metrics ** (Jaccard, Tversky, Tanimoto and cosine): these metrics treat the two strings as ‘bags of words’ and measure how many words they have in common - that is, they are not concerned with the order or sequences of words. The Tanimoto function gives a negative value, where the lower the value the greater the distance between the strings. The other three functions tested give values from 0 (no words in common) to 1 (the counts of words in the strings are identical). We observed that all four functions tended to give results that were proportional to one another, and they were mostly effective at separating cases of transmission (high similarity) from non-transmission (low similarity). However, they were susceptible to cases in which pairs of descriptions shared much vocabulary whilst not being examples of transmission: this happens when descriptions of different impressions of the same printed image are written independently but refer to many of the same things in the printed image, or when two descriptions relate to two different printed images that depict many similar kinds of things. For the example in Figure 6, which shows descriptions of two different impressions of the same printed image which appear to us not to be based on one another, the Jaccard, Tversky and cosine functions all returned scores greater than 0.8, and the Tanimoto function returned -0.31; that is, for the example in Figure 3, token-based metrics detect - erroneously - a case of transmission.</p>

<p><strong>Sequence-based functions</strong>  (Ratcliff Obershelp (RO), Longest Common Substring (LCS)): the LCS function simply returns the longest substring that the two strings share in common<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> . For the pair of descriptions in Figure 6 this is broken mirror which quickly suggests that the descriptions were written independently, whereas a long substring could indicate copying. We could count the number of characters in the longest common substring in order to rank pairs of descriptions as a percentage of the length of the description. However, it would give a misleading low score in cases where a copied description has been lightly edited in several places throughout. The RO function accounts for multiple common substrings, and returns a value between 0-1 which gets closer to 1 as the two strings share more and longer sequences of words. Unlike the token-based metrics, it seems to be effective at distinguishing pairs of descriptions that are partial copies from pairs that just happen to share a lot of common vocabulary: for the pair in Figure 6, RO gave a score of 0.37, and for the pair in Figure 5 it gave 0.84; that is, RO detects transmission in Figure 5 but not in Figure 6. The only problem we noted with RO was that, like all the other functions we considered, it is vulnerable to pairs of short descriptions that share multiple multiword technical and indexing terms, whilst not being examples of transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Normalised compression distance</strong>  (bwtrle_ncd, sqrt_ncd, bz2_ncd, lzma_ncd, zlib_ncd): in principle the application of a text compression algorithm to two strings serves to amplify their similarities or differences; the five functions we tried correspond to five different compression algorithms. However, we struggled to understand how these functions work and how to interpret their results. For example in a preliminary trial they gave the following values for pair of identical descriptions when, intuitively we might have expected either 0 or 1: bwtrle_ncd (0.67), sqrt_ncd (0.41), bz2_ncd (0.23), lzma_ncd (0.02), and zlib_ncd (0.03). This discouraged us from exploring them further, but this is not to say that they do not warrant further consideration for the task of detecting transmission.</p>
<p>An optimal approach might combine several text distance functions in order to detect the broadest possible range of copying/editing/addition, e.g. direct complete copying, with minor formatting or other changes; incorporation of (part of) one description into another; and, paraphrasing of another description. However it would require much more research (beyond the scope of this paper) to understand how to effectively combine the functions and optimise their use, so we proceeded using just one.</p>
<p>As noted, the Ratcliff Obershelp (RO) function looked to be the most suitable for our purposes, however we realised that it would be prohibitively resource intensive for the task at hand. We estimated that it would take up to two years to run a pairwise comparison of 4,545 LWL x 9,330 BMSat descriptions, using a relatively high-powered workstation and without exploiting parallelisation. Usefully in the standard Python library the Sequence Matcher class includes an implementation of a text distance function which is considered to be similar to RO. With a further trial we observed that this function produces results that are similar to or better than RO, i.e. it makes similar, and sometimes sharper, distinctions between transmission and not transmission.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  Importantly this implementation executes significantly more quickly than RO - according to its documentation,<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  it executes in linear time in the best case and in quadratic time at worst; this compares with cubic time in the worst case for RO. Furthermore, the function can very quickly calculate a highest-possible value (sequenceMatcher.realquickratio), allowing for many pairs to be discounted before a more expensive and accurate calculation is made (sequenceMatcher.ratio).</p>
<p>For the pairwise comparison of 4,545 Lewis Walpole Library descriptions with 9,330 BMSat descriptions we first pre-processed the Lewis Walpole Library descriptions to mirror how the BMSat descriptions had been prepared. This involved some text clean-up and substituting bracketed and quoted text with the strings BRACKETED and TRANSCRIBED.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  Then we executed a script which for each LWL-BMSat pair: (i) computed sequenceMatcher.realquickratio and skipped to the next pair if this was &lt; 0.9; then, (ii) computed sequenceMatcher.ratio<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  and filtered results to remove pairs for which SM.ratio &lt; 0.5 which, from inspection of trial results, we are confident is a suitable threshold to remove only pairs that are not examples of transmission. The remaining 1,649 pairs were written to a file with their similarity scores<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  for subsequent analysis (see Section 3.1). The script took about 5 hours to execute.</p>
<h2 id="3-analysing-transmission">3. Analysing transmission</h2>
<p>The three selections of records made in Section 2 were analysed in order to consider to what extent they contain instances of transmission, and to explore what we can learn from them about the processes of transmission. Here we describe methods for characterising transmission and elaborate on different kinds of transmission from BMSat to records at the Lewis Walpole Library. It is important to note that this analysis is situated in our shared knowledge of and familiarity with the catalogues at hand.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  As such then, our case study and our analysis of it provides a way into developing a conceptual framework for thinking about the different ways in which catalogues are shaped and constructed over time. But other case studies of transmission between catalogues, that - we contend - could follow our approaches to select candidate records and analyse those selections, will provide different contributions to that framework.</p>
<h2 id="31-computer-assisted-close-reading">3.1 Computer-assisted close reading</h2>
<p>In this sub-section we focus on the close reading of computationally selected groups of descriptions, a method akin to what Martin Paul Eve calls  <em>Close Reading with Computers</em>  [<a href="#eve2019">2019</a>]. The selection reported in Section 2.1.2 consists of 518 instances in which the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue contained multiple records for different impressions of the same printed image (1,141 records in total). From this selection we focused on the MARC 520 Summary Fields, used by the Lewis Walpole Library for object descriptions. In the majority of instances the linked records contained either identical descriptions or a combination of an empty field and a description. In the remaining instances, we observed from the MARC 520 Summary Field signs of transmission that fell broadly into one of three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Descriptions which are copies or near copies of descriptions of different impressions of the same printed image in other catalogues, either a) with the copied text quoted and with an accompanying citation in the MARC 520 Field (most of which appear to come from British Museum Collections Online) or b) with the text unquoted and with an accompanying citation in the MARC 500 or 510 Fields. For example, in the case of  _A Nincompoop, or hen peck&rsquo;d husband _ (1807) there are two Lewis Walpole Library descriptions. In one of these Lewis Walpole Library descriptions the text is the same the British Museum Online description but with three changes: first, the opening line is edited from ‘A small ugly man trots (l. to r.)’ to ‘A small ugly man trots (walking left to right)’; second the British Museum Online description<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  is placed within double quotation marks; and third, ‘ — British Museum catalogue’ is inserted after the quotation marks.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  In the second Lewis Walpole Library description of  <em>A Nincompoop</em>  the British Museum Online description is again placed within double quotation marks, but on this occasion it is followed by the wording ‘British Museum online catalogue, description of an earlier state’.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Descriptions which take narrative or linguistic elements from descriptions of different impressions of the same printed image in other catalogues, usually British Museum Collections Online or the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> , but contain significant differences or adaptations. For example, we find Lewis Walpole Library descriptions that are summaries of corresponding descriptions in another catalogue. This is the case with  <em>A fashionable suit!</em>  (1800), for which the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue description retains the narrative structure of the British Museum Collections Online description but in truncated form, as observed in Figure 7.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<p>The selection made in Section 2.1.2 enabled us to observe the presence of transmission from BMSat to the Lewis Walpole Library, and to begin to understand the variability of that transmission. However the analysis is insufficient to form the basis of a conceptual framework for thinking about the different ways in which catalogues are shaped and constructed over time. The selection of LWL-BMSat 1649 pairs ranked by a text distance metric (described in Section 2.2) provided then a usefully different and complimentary set of descriptions with which to develop that framework.<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup></p>
<p>In an echo of the Section 2.1.2 selection, the majority of pairs ranked in Section 2.2 as candidate examples of transmission by Sequence Matcher are very close matches: roughly 3 in 4 pairs have a SM.ratio greater than 0.9, and these pairs differ only by single word replacements (e.g. “pig which” to “pig who”), the removal of a series number, or the expansion of an acronym. The pairs with a lower SM.ratio score exhibit different phenomena. One pair (SM.ratio=0.5) shows transmission from BMSat to Lewis Walpole Library that includes removing an opening line (“Heading to printed verses <em>BRACKETED</em>”) in favour of placing that information in a different MARC field, and a conclusion that adds additional descriptive detail (“They raise glasses whose stems have been broken”).<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  A second pair (SM.ratio=0.58) indicates direct transmission from BMSat to Lewis Walpole Library, but with a new line inserted in the middle of the description that emphasises an aspect of the print omitted from the BMSat description.<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  We also find in this selection the description of a Rowlandson border fragment published in 1799 that is not in the  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires _ but is written in the style so closely resembling descriptions in the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em>  that it is paired (SM.ratio=0.5) with a description for a different print. This pair is presented in Figure 8.</p>

<p>But these are edge cases. As we read across all the selected pairs, more regular patterns of transmission start to emerge. Lewis Walpole Library entries expand on abbreviations in BMSat, for example, BMSat 4922 becomes British Museum satire no. 4922.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>  Lewis Walpole Library entries systematically revise quirks of BMSat descriptions: for example, they remove brackets from spatial vocabulary and quotation marks from eighteenth-century terminology.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  And in Lewis Walpole Library descriptions leading and trailing details from BMSat descriptions are removed and distributed to other parts of the catalogue entry. These patterns of revision are not always consistent. For example, the Lewis Walpole Library description for  <em>The rake&rsquo;s progress at the University</em>  (1806) is a lossy transmission in that it omits from the description the leading text See BMSat 10639, a reference to another print in the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> , without finding it a place elsewhere in the record.<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>  More often, however, these details are retained, such as in the Lewis Walpole Library entry for Rowlandson’s 1807 print  <em>Mrs. Showwell</em>  which removes from the close of the description 26 February 1807. Hand-coloured etching., and places those details appropriate to the object at hand (it is not coloured) in the MARC 260 (Publication, Distribution, etc. (Imprint)) and 300 (Physical Description) Fields respectively.<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>  Here transmission intersects with temporally specific cataloguing infrastructures. Printing methods, dates of production, and references to other prints were details that it made sense for Mary Dorothy George to include in the main body of her object descriptions: in a printed catalogue, the consistent placement of information on the page and relative to other details was a proxy for record structure. When these records were moved to British Museum Collections Online, they were parsed in largely unadapted form so as to create unmarked sub-fields in a flexible collection database designed for a large and varied museum collection <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. But when parsed to fit first a card catalogue system devised by the Lewis’s and later a digital catalogue built on a granular bibliographic standard (MARC 21) capable of handling hundreds of unique fields, it appears that it made greater sense to move these details to dedicated fields.<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup></p>
<p>If this reading provides insight into how cataloguing infrastructures shaped the transmission of catalogue data over time, the selection made with a text distance metric in Section 2.2 also underscores the role of objects in shaping transmission: in short, on numerous occasions Lewis Walpole Library catalogue entries diverge from BMSat equivalents so as to better represent the object at hand. For example, in the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue entry for  _Mrs. Showwell _ the opening line -  “Below the title: ‘The Woman who shews General Guise collection of Pictures at Oxford’”  - is removed as the Lewis Walpole Library version is trimmed and thus contains no title. In the Lewis Walpole Library description of a Peter Pinder print from 1787, the opening to the corresponding BMSat entry -  “Proof without letters”  - is removed as the Lewis Walpole Library object is not a proof.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  And in the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue record for a 1828 print depicting chess players, the MARC 520 field repeats the description found in BMSat for a near identical print from circa 1788, but removes the opening line -  “Title perhaps cut off”  - because the Lewis Walpole Library object contains the full print and shows that no title was ever present.<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup></p>
<p>The text distance selection thus enabled us to build on model of transmission discussed above and to identify three categories of divergent transmission:</p>
<p>procedural divergence, in which BMSat records were adapted to align with cataloguing practices at and/or infrastructural choices made by the Lewis Walpole Library;  divergence due to variant objects, in which BMSat records were adapted to align with material characteristics of objects held by the Lewis Walpole Library;  revisions to descriptions, whether in the form of truncated prose, additional detail, or word switches, the motivations for which are difficult to ascertain from the records alone.</p>
<p>Taken together, close reading suggests that many Lewis Walpole Library records projected Mary Dorothy George into the future, lightly editing her on the way, but doing little to arrest her historically specific interlocution between us and the catalogued past. Where George was revised for reasons other than cataloguing procedure or variant objects, we glimpse the aspects of her descriptions that most troubled subsequent cataloguers. Some of these revisions suggest an attentiveness to the identities that George saw as normative. For example, the Lewis Walpole Library entry for  _A West India sportsman _ adapts the opening  “The sportsman sits in a chair..”  to  “The English sportsman sits in a chair..,”  in recognition of the fact that in BMSat men are Englishmen unless described otherwise.<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>  And whilst the retention of a racial epithet in the Lewis Walpole Library entry for  _A West India sportsman _ reminds us that such revisions were themselves historical acts, and whilst as Vermeulen and Carby [<a href="#carby2014">2014</a>] note in the Lewis Walpole Library catalogue  “[t]here is no subject  White;  white people are, quite literally, the unmarked bodies of the archive,”  other revisions suggest some recognition of George’s historically specific choice of language. For example, the Lewis Walpole Library entry for Woodward and Tegg’s 1807  _A riddle expounded, or, The dignity of a parsons horse _ - an interaction between a parson and  “a jovial countryman”  that sends up monarchical power - shows transmission intersecting with changing curatorial sensibilities (see Figure 9). This print features a heavily caricatured parson, a hybrid of two long-eighteenth century stereotypes: the money-grubbing tithe pig and the drunken clergyman popularised by the ballad  “The Vicar and Moses”   <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. In turn, George described the parson as  “drink-blotched and prosperous-looking,” <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>  language revised by a Lewis Walpole Library cataloguer(s) to  “red-faced and freckled and prosperous looking, with a round belly.” <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  This revision performs three functions: first, it delegitimises pejorative associations of facial markings with alcoholism; second, by noting the round belly, the revision provides an example of what  “prosperous looking”  might look like to long-eighteenth century British satirical audiences; and third, it expands - if only a little - the assumed readers of the description from a narrow group of experts in long-eighteenth century British history to a more general public. Taken together with other revisions made to George’s original - a correction to the mounting point of a railing, the creation of greater motion in spatial terminology, the assertion that to have a sermon in one’s pocket is to carry it - the Lewis Walpole Library description of  <em>A riddle expounded</em>  transmits George for the present: for search, for diverse audiences, and for a context in which collecting institutions recognise and address their roles in maintaining structural inequalities.</p>

</figure>
<p>The case of  <em>A riddle expounded</em>  is also a validation of our methods. From George’s 80 word description of the print, thirteen words are edited or replaced by the Lewis Walpole Library and sixteen words are added. These edits are not clustered together, they change every line and most clauses, such that a 58 character string - to  “a tree, to address a fat elderly parson on horseback (r”  - is the longest shared by both the BMSat and Lewis Walpole Library descriptions. By using a suitable text distance metric we were able to surface transmission like this, to read it, and to report on it. In so doing we expanded our knowledge of BMSat to Lewis Walpole Library transmission beyond MARC fields that record transmission, revisions between descriptions of different impressions of the same printed image, and descriptions truncated by the omission of opening or closing details. This understanding of transmission was complemented by analysis, reported in the next sub-section, of those descriptions presumed to be written by the Lewis Walpole Library.</p>
<h2 id="32-corpus-linguistic-analysis">3.2 Corpus linguistic analysis</h2>
<p>In this sub-section our analysis switches from the close reading of individual descriptions to a corpus-level comparison of descriptions from the two catalogues at hand. We previously conducted a corpus linguistic analysis of the BMSat corpus which identified a characteristic curatorial voice in its descriptions, in terms of what things were typically referred to or ignored in descriptions, and in terms of the degree of description/interpretation/evaluation <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. In Section 2.1.2 of the current paper we described the creation of a set of 543 Lewis Walpole Library descriptions which we believe were not based directly on any BMSat descriptions. If this set of Lewis Walpole Library descriptions exhibits similar characteristics to the BMSat corpus then that would support the idea of transmission of style, although this alone would not be sufficient evidence to say that the Lewis Walpole Library style was influenced by George’s style rather than their both being influenced by something else.</p>
<p>We applied the method from Salway and Baker [<a href="#salway2020">2020</a>] to analyse the 543 Lewis Walpole Library descriptions (hereafter LWL 543). Here we show and discuss the results alongside the earlier results for the BMSat corpus;<sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>  given that the LWL 543 comprise only about 33,000 words (compared with around one million for BMSat) we recognise that any conclusions drawn from the analysis can only be tentative.</p>
<p>Figure 10 shows the 100 most frequent words in BMSat alongside the 100 most frequent in LWL 543 (cf. Table 2 in Salway and Baker [<a href="#salway2020">2020</a>]). Words that occur in both top 100’s are shown in bold, whilst the remaining words are underlined and their rank position in the other corpus is given in brackets<sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup> . There are seventy words in the top 100’s for both corpora, and many of these appear in similarly ranked positions. Furthermore, many of the thirty remaining words in each list occur in rank position 101-200 in the other list, i.e. sixteen of the BMSat top 100 are in positions 101-200 in LWL 543, and nineteen of the LWL 543 top 100 are ranked 101-200 in BMSat.<sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup></p>
<p>Whilst some words would be expected to feature high in the frequency list for most English-language corpora, e.g. ‘the’, ‘a’, ‘of’ etc., many words that are prominent in both lists are particular to the task of describing visual objects, and satirical prints specifically, e.g. ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘wearing’, ‘hat’, ‘dressed’, ‘background’. Thus the results shown in Figure 10 suggest that the LWL catalogue contains descriptions that, whilst not based directly on specific descriptions from BMSat, share a style or curatorial voice.</p>

<p>The next main step in the analysis of BMSat descriptions was to group the 300 most frequent words according to the kind of information they provide, see Figure 3 in Salway and Baker [<a href="#baker2020">2020</a>]. Figure 11 in the current paper uses the same categories to group the top 100 words in LWL 543<sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup> . The fact that these words fit well in the same categories suggests that the LWL descriptions are providing similar informational content as the BMSat descriptions. For example, 10 of the 18 nouns listed in Figure 11 appear in the corresponding list for BMSat: the remaining 8 (chair, wig, door, dog, women, room, floor, stick) are similar in referring to people and everyday things in quite generic ways.</p>

<p>Turning from informational content to consider the extent to which BMSat descriptions interpret/evaluate visual content, rather than describe it, Salway and Baker [<a href="#salway2020">2020</a>] analysed the 100 most frequent words ending in -ly. We noted many examples of words that were likely used to interpret something about somebody’s actions in terms of their mental state, e.g. ‘angrily’, ‘delightedly’, ‘derisively’, ‘contemptuously’, such as to give a sense of a story playing out (see Table 6 in Salway and Baker [<a href="#salway2020">2020</a>]). We also noted words used to make an evaluative judgement such as about somebody’s appearance, e.g. ‘fashionably’ and ‘grotesquely’. For comparison, a list of -ly words occurring three or more times in the LWL 543 descriptions is given in Figure 12. Though the small number of examples means we cannot draw firm conclusions, it does seem that whilst the LWL 543 descriptions show signs of evaluating appearances (see the bolded words), there is only one example of a word that could be used to interpret an action such as to give a sense of a story playing out, i.e. ‘intently’. Whether this is due to a different curatorial style, or simply the contents of the prints being described, would require a different line of investigation.</p>

<p>By basing our comparison on existing results for one corpus there is perhaps a danger of us observing similarities and missing differences. To actively seek differences, we conducted a keyness analysis to identify words that occur relatively more often in one corpus than the other, with statistical significance. Figures 13 and 14 show the keywords in BMSat and LWL 543 respectively<sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup> .</p>
<p>Various differences stand out in the keyword lists. First, proper names (Mrs, Wellington, Fox, Napoleon, Duke, John) are keywords in BMSat relative to LWL 543, whilst unnamed people (woman, man) and everyday scenes (dog, chair, table, wall) are keywords in LWL 543 relative to BMSat. This may be explained by the LWL 543 selection containing a higher proportion of records for social satires than BMSat, wherein descriptions of political satires - featuring men like Charles James Fox, Napoleon Bonaparte and the Duke of Wellington - account for roughly three-fifths of all descriptions. Second, when compared with BMSat, the LWL 543 descriptions do not contain references such as ‘See BMSat’ ‘BM No’. This supports that observation in Section 3.1 that Lewis Walpole Library records either expand on these abbreviations or move such abbreviations to dedicated data fields.<sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>  The BMSat list also contains words that we might consider to be part of a general language of description and it might seem surprising that these are not used so much in the LWL 543. However, the presence of some may be due to the content of prints, i.e. more prints depicting speech (answers, saying and says), and another due to spelling variation (centre). The remaining BMSat keywords (inscribed, cocked, design, round, extreme, profile, Behind, He, which, wears) may point to minor stylistic differences or may simply be due to the small amount of text in the LWL 543 descriptions.</p>

<p>In summary, for all the points of comparison relating to informational content - i.e. what is described, and what vocabulary is used - the results suggest that overall the BMSat and LWL 543 descriptions are very similar. The comparison in terms of degree of description/interpretation/evaluation suggested some difference, but was inconclusive given the small number of examples available in the LWL 543. Thus, we may tentatively conclude that a common language of cataloguing is used for descriptions in both catalogues, even for those records where there cannot have been direct transmission of records from one to the other. This leaves open the possibility that the LWL 543 descriptions were influenced by the transmission of curatorial voice from BMSat: however, to make any claims about direct influence from one catalogue to another - as distinct from two catalogues sharing an influence from elsewhere - would require a different kind of investigation, i.e. a parallel historical investigation into the circumstances in which catalogue records were produced.</p>
<h2 id="4-discussion">4. Discussion</h2>
<p>We have shown how a mixed methods approach can be used to systematically identify those catalogue records that are likely to be the products of transmission from an earlier catalogue and to analyse them such that models of transmission can be elaborated. Whilst we stopped short of asserting that these models form the beginnings of a conceptual framework for thinking about the different ways in which catalogues are shaped and constructed over time, we expect that the findings from our case study will resonate with both cataloguing professionals and researchers who rely on catalogue records, especially those who work closely with visual materials, domains where cataloguers like Mary Dorothy George are canonical influences.</p>
<p>In the case of George and the hypothesised transmission from the  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires _ to catalogue records for printed images held by the Lewis Walpole Library, we found -  _per _ Baxandall - that influence was varied. Transmission through time, across space, and between mediums took many forms. There were cases where catalogue descriptions were copied, quoted, and cited, and there were cases where transmission was stylistic. Staff at the Lewis Walpole Library drew on and engaged with the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> , and latterly their derivations on British Museum Collections Online, as a source of expertise. Individual cataloguers reacted to the normative assumptions of George’s early- to mid- twentieth century British worldview and developed her thinking for modern audiences. When their objects demanded it, the Library staff differentiated their records from those in the  <em>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</em> . And records made for a paper catalogue were remodelled for digital cataloguing infrastructures.</p>
<p>Whilst we can speculate, often with some confidence, on the reasons why a given pattern of transmission occurred, the methods we present are less able to get at purpose and process, at why and how transmission occurred the way it did. For example, we may know that descriptions written by the Lewis Walpole Library are linguistically similar to those in BMSat (Section 3.2), but we do not know why cataloguers produced each George-like descriptions, how their access to the  _Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires _ and latterly their derivations on British Museum Collections Online shaped the production of catalogue records, or the extent to which George-like precedents set early in the Library’s life shaped later behaviour. Equally, we know that, for example, the Lewis Walpole Library record for  <em>Bath Races</em>  tackles and subverts the linguistic choices in George’s entry, but only through detailed analysis of institutional histories and processes can we develop a mature understanding of why the decision was made to produce this description and how and when that occurred. It is a cliche to say that ‘more research is needed’, but when historically specific labours and practices are obscured both by the presentation of the catalogue as an always-already present unifying entity, and when collections are federated for access, into datasets, or as machine readable endpoints, knowing our data is vital; we may not be able to fix or eliminate the biases in a given catalogue or dataset, but we can and should enquire into their ‘deeper structural issues, historical antecedents, and power asymmetries’ <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>, of which - in the domain of cultural heritage - the transmission of legacy voices across time and outside their historical place is one.</p>
<p>Our methods can advance these imperatives in that they provide a relatively collection agnostic approach to characterising types of transmission between collection catalogues at scale. Findings resulting from comparable analysis at collecting institutions can form the basis for a variety of actions to be taken forward depending on institutional context and priorities: further archival research into cataloguing processes to correlate and enrich data driven findings; oral histories with staff to create data on why choices were made; revisions to records to highlight the source of their information; rationalisation between records to even out parsing during transmission; allocation of staff time towards plans to repair records, document common types of transmission, and/or write business cases for recataloguing. We note here that the age or size of an institution may create variability in how far our methods can be usefully redeployed or enable opportunities not presented by our case study: for example, departments that are (or once were) responsible for managing their own catalogues may have retained rich data on the editing and versioning of their catalogue records; alternatively, catalogues may have been produced in distinct and known phases or batches to support the use of a new cataloguing infrastructures (e.g. card catalogue, early database, online collections portal), such that sub-divisions of records can be made prior to analysis. Nevertheless, for collecting institutions of all ages and sizes, maintaining a catalogue is central to their operation. Computational methods for detecting transmission and for characterising the multi-faceted influences that produced their catalogue can, we hope, usefully support that operation and in turn enrich understanding of the collections those catalogues describe.</p>

<p>During the Golden Age of British satirical prints, print reproduction used craft-like technologies that made exact reproduction unachievable: for example, each copper plate engraving or etching was inked by hand, lines incised on copper plates lost definition each time they we used in printing, and colouring was completed by outworkers by hand. As a result, whilst multiple impressions from the same plate often constituted part of the same print run and would have contained the same narrative content, the impressions often sufficiently differ so as to require divergent description. For the history of Golden Age British satirical prints and their production see Baker [<a href="#baker2017">2017</a>], Donald [<a href="#donald1996">1996</a>] and Gatrell [<a href="#gatrell2006">2006</a>].

<p>Whilst the resource intensivity of our work is not equivalent to that of, say, training a large language model, we contend that all DH work should be mindful of its resource intensivity.

<p>What connections can 21st-century students at an American university have to people in Paris during World War II? In fact, how can both the instructor and her students from an American university understand a past that none of them lived in and that happened far away? To teach a course on WWII Paris confronts the educator with challenging epistemological and pedagogical questions. Referring to the six facets of understanding by <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, how can students feel empathy for and gain perspective and self-knowledge from subjects so far removed — linguistically, geographically, temporally, psychologically — from themselves? How can one find the words to talk about the ineffable Shoah? Finally, how can one expect them to imagine the German occupation of a city to which some of them have never been?</p>
<p>To address these questions, the instructor, librarians, and students collaboratively developed a series of digital projects to archive and spatially locate the fragmented stories of Paris-based Shoah survivors. The instructor, Mélanie Péron, shared strong friendships and working relationships with several living survivors, to whom she introduced her students. In turn, her students became acquainted with these individuals from the fall of 2019 into the spring of 2020 as they worked on their respective narratives. The course culminated in a week-long stay in Paris, during which students met these individuals in person. Librarians, Vickie Karasic and Meaghan Moody, partnered with Mélanie and her students through their development of digital projects founded on critical making and feminist pedagogy. Using mapping and immersive technologies, students created social artifacts intended to live on well after the course. More importantly, they fostered collective experiences that overcame the differences of place and time to understand themselves, others, and cultural issues.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-frameworks">Theoretical Frameworks</h2>
<p>We draw upon our interpretation of critical making in part as <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> articulates in his foundational article on the subject, defining it as  “a mode of materially productive engagement that is intended to bridge the gap between creative physical and conceptual exploration”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Critical making overlaps and shares practices with art and design, including critical design <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, but departs in its focus on the process over the product. <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> further highlights that critical making entails the thoughtful and engaged communication between makers, the destabilization of power differentials, and the creation of connections between theory and practice. Perhaps above all, <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> articulates as key to critical making the investment of self and care in the process to bear a responsibility in the project’s enduring existence:  “Ultimately, critical making is about turning the relationship between technology and society from a ‘matter of fact’ into a ‘matter of concern.’ I see this as requiring personal investment, a ‘caring for’ that is not typically part of either technical or social scholarly education”   <sup id="fnref4:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. For our purposes, then, critical making entails both the collaborative production of digital cultural artifacts and, more importantly, the fostering of human connections that are brought about by, and live through, these technological objects beyond this project. Our focus on authentic concern, interconnection, and personal investment also aligns with tenets of the feminist ethics of care.</p>
<p>Because of the intensely personal and poignant nature of the course, it was critical to embrace the feminist strategy of an ethics of care as its cornerstone. As <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> has argued,  “To teach in a manner that respects and cares for the souls of our students is essential if we are to provide the necessary conditions where learning can most deeply and intimately begin”   <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. As spots were limited in the course, first-round students had to answer essay questions followed by an interview for the second round. Through this process, Mélanie and the students got to know one another, and she learned about their motivations for participating in the course. She gave priority to first-generation and/or low-income students for whom the trip was covered by financial aid and the opportunity to travel abroad was the first one and might be the last. On the first day of class, an important convention was introduced to the class. The students and the instructor were to address each other on a first-name basis. The linguistic familiarity translated into the creation of a genuine, fostering, and co-constructive community. Students were also given weekly, extensive personalized feedback and support throughout the course, as they engaged both with this complex and tragic period of history and in direct communication with survivors.</p>
<p>Credited as the originator of the ethics of care theory, <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> describes the ethics of care as a  “psychological logic of relationships”   <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> that denotes a  “connection between self and others which is articulated by the concept of responsibility”   <sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Students were invited as collaborators into the class, and they were tasked with creating digital projects that preserved survivors’ histories. We asked students to exercise care and empathy for these individuals and worked to cultivate this capacity through discussion, activities, and feedback. Elaborating on <sup id="fnref2:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> writes,  “And what makes care feminist is that it sees students as whole human beings, not vessels to be filled with information and knowledge. It sees learners as people with thoughts and feelings that they bring to the classroom, and which, in turn, affect how they learn”   <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Students were not merely absorbing this history and translating it into digital projects but rather were in dialogue with survivors and the instructor while aligning their own understanding and experiences to those of the survivors — requiring vulnerability, awareness, and emotional work. For example, a creative writing project involved two parts over the course of the semester: first, students wrote, weekly, a chapter of a fictional character’s memoirs living in Paris during the German Occupation, the testimony of which aimed at showing a human facet of history; after this, students wrote under imposed constraints inspired by post-memory writers, in particular Georges Perec. The list of constraints included writing a text about a chosen number, writing a list of memories starting each sentence by I remember, and picking a letter from the alphabet and writing a text made of words excluding that letter. The objective here was for students to experience the difficulties faced by the survivors to tell their stories and to give shape to the voids and the silences left by history. At the end of the semester, students were asked to compile their pieces in any order; the ultimate constraint involved embedding one final page – a new creation of their choosing – in the very middle of the collected work. This new page acted as the cylindrical mirror in an anamorphic construction through which scattered and disparate fragments regain a shape and therefore a meaning invisible until then. In every single case, the anamorphic page revealed to the students that, unbeknownst to them, the story of their fictional character was a portal through which they discovered a piece of themselves or rediscovered a piece of their own narrative. In other words, the creative writing project mirrored what the historical digital projects were meant to achieve.</p>
<p>We aimed for students to feel connected to these individuals and a shared responsibility for their legacies. Building upon the ethics of care, <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>&rsquo;s work describes archivists as  “caregivers, bound to records, creators, subjects, users, and communities through a web of mutual affective responsibility”   <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. The digital projects would be created through the connections students developed with their survivors, the instructor, librarians, and with one another. In the classroom, students from varied backgrounds bonded over the course discussions and projects, and these bonds continued to strengthen while in Paris. The well-traveled students kindly and unassumingly helped their classmates ease into the exotic experience. They also problem-solved, griped, shared joy and sorrow, and made things together, while contributing to the growing body of Shoah archiving taken on by the instructor.</p>
<p>At the intersection of theory and practice, feminist maker pedagogy extends feminist pedagogical modes of inquiry and critique into practice. <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> writes,  “Introducing ‘making’ as a pedagogical tool into a feminist classroom highlights the importance of moving beyond the critique. Feminist makers critique, but they also  <em>engage</em> ,  <em>speculate</em> , and  <em>generate</em> ”   <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Feminist makers contextualize, identify with, and reflect on their projects. Making informed by feminist pedagogy encompasses making that is rooted explicitly in care and connection:  “it pays attention to the politics of care and vulnerability; and it touches at all points, on the embodied and interconnected experience of beings in living systems”   <sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Through feminist maker pedagogy, students learn not only how to use tools but also to ask deeper questions about those tools and how they are using them. In turn, making prompts students to ask new questions and explore a concept through a different modality. Students also grow to appreciate troubleshooting, viewing it as a necessary step to better understanding and new ideas.</p>
<p>Feminist maker pedagogy pushes back against prevailing conceptions both of being a Maker and of participation in the  <em>Maker Movement</em> , which are often associated with white, cishet, able-bodied, upper-middle-class men and centered on capitalist values and high-technology (e.g., robotics and coding) projects <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Our project embraced this outlook in particular with our reliance on the feminist strategy of intuition, which <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> describes as  “valu[ing] the inner voice, that quiet way of knowing, that is contrary to the stereotypical, empirical, androcentric way of knowing”   <sup id="fnref3:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Accordingly, the project and the way Mélanie engages with her students stem from serendipity, intuition, and instinct — all of which defy simple definition and analysis. We must also recognize and acknowledge our positions of privilege here, having the affordances of access to technology and resources that have made our project, the tools, and travel it has entailed entirely possible.</p>

<p>With our theoretical groundwork laid, we can further expand on the choice of technologies for our project; namely, immersive technologies. While the instructor has experimented with a variety of digital tools and methods in her courses, this article focuses primarily on the creation of 360º recordings that were embedded into a digital map and experienced on a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD). We selected VR as our medium for this project for several reasons. First, VR often provides for more engaging learning objects:  “Virtual reconstructions […] help students understand cultures, histories, and artifacts that are physically, temporally, or culturally distant. While it may be difficult for American students to visit Notre Dame, extended realities can help them experience it in a way that more traditional media cannot”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. While in the HMD, the user is immersed in a 360º simulation in which they can look in any direction and visit distant places and times. Not all Mélanie’s classes are able to visit Paris, but through VR, they can stand in a park in Paris, view people walking around them, become aware of the spatial distance between the various elements surrounding them, and listen to fragments of their conversations. VR brings the user closer to the real experience than simply reading about it, hearing a description, or viewing a video clip. It may not only combine all these modalities but also includes a focused environment and a first-person perspective. This capability feels especially invaluable in light of the still unfolding COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty of safe travel. VR also makes private spaces more accessible. Anyone can visit a public park but perhaps not a personal residence or a fragile environment. Further, VR and 360º recording technology, in particular, can serve as archiving tools to preserve a place at a point in time. Imagine being able to revisit your childhood bedroom or your grandparent’s house exactly as they looked when you were a child. This was the effect we wanted our students to experience.</p>
<p>With VR technologies, we can also integrate additional data and engagement opportunities. For example, <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> describe an XR (extended reality) project to illustrate Native Ohlone history at Santa Clara University:  “Further, the technology provided an additional representational layer allowing students not only to analyze what is present in the commemorative landscape but also to reveal the histories that have been effectively erased from our campus, such as unmarked mission cemeteries”   <a href="#lueck2020">para. 19</a> . In this case, students digitally annotated 360º recordings with critical interpretations of their campus’s history, which aren’t represented on the current physical sites. In this way, VR technologies enable users to create multimodal learning experiences with layered, immersive stories. There is also growing evidence to suggest that VR can impact visioning and transcultural understanding. For example, <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> created  <em>La République</em> , an educational VR experience that shares the lives of four Parisians living in the same quarter. The experience follows these individuals throughout their days at work and at home and in public and private contexts. They found that the project  “led to a clear shift in students’ understanding of Parisian culture”   <sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Of note, they saw that after the VR experiences, students who had not previously been to Paris scored similarly to students who had been to Paris before in being able to  “imagine their potential role as active participants in Parisian life”   <sup id="fnref2:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. The project attempts to enable students to experience feelings of presence, which <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> describe as  “the sense of being in a place”   <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> and argue allow users to understand another’s perspective and thereby empathize with them.</p>
<h2 id="vr-and-empathy">VR and Empathy</h2>
<p>Visual artist Chris Milk famously described VR as the  “ultimate empathy machine”  during a 2015 TED Talk. Milk created the VR film,  <em>Clouds Over Sidra</em> , about a young girl’s experience in a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan. <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> claims the medium enables the viewer to  “feel her humanity in a deeper way”  and to  “empathize with her in a deeper way.”  Immersive technologies have become a very popular creation tool for consciousness raising and social justice work. For example, many projects center issues of race <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, sexual and gender identity <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, and other topics. While research has found that VR can promote empathy <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, this concept is also understandably receiving criticism. Acknowledging that empathy awareness raising projects are often well intentioned, <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> argues that VR  “is identity tourism for the 21st century, but with a difference. This time, the kinds of bodies that are on offer are not just exotic, racialized and gendered avatars that users can take on recreationally and temporarily”   <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> and that VR  “reproduce[s] racial violence in the name of reducing it”   <sup id="fnref2:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. The temporary  “owning”  of another’s body and experiences is problematic in that you cannot automate real and genuine connection with another human being. One cannot really understand what it is to live in a refugee camp by wearing a VR HMD for a few minutes. <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> suggests,  “If you want to decolonize VR, I think we need to look at how to give resources to communities to produce VR that don’t have it now.”  This could also involve, at a very minimum, collaboration with the communities centered by the project. <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> recommend that the collaborative process should make room for  “consultation in an iterative process of design and feedback”   <a href="#lueck2020">para. 32</a>. <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> argues that working with communities  “and in some cases co-writing and co-filming [leads] to better storytelling”   <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Our project could not have happened without the relationships and trust Mélanie shared with the survivors, which she spent years cultivating. The survivors also provided guidance throughout the process. In one case, the 360º recording was created in the presence of a survivor, Rachel Jedinak, who guided us around key locations. In her written memoir, Jedinak echoes what we hope VR can provide the viewers. She explains that when she finally found the strength to go back to the neighborhood of her childhood, in 1997,  “[she] reconstructed the places, the streets, the routes, and the map now has its shape and lines, wrapped around Duris Street. [Her] past regains its geography.” <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  In another case, a survivor’s memoir informed how students filmed locations described in the text. The recordings were also presented to the survivors, who offered feedback and answered students’ questions. This input was then integrated into the final product and proved invaluable because students learned from these interactions and subsequently adapted their approaches. Our project sought to explore VR’s potential for empathy fostering and perspective sharing. Nevertheless, we neither claim that the tool is a replacement for real connections nor that it can really make the user understand the violence of life under Occupation or the tragedy of the Shoah. We also do not see this project as a means to an end but rather as another creative strategy to preserve this history and reach and engage with new audiences.</p>
<h2 id="vr-and-making">VR and Making</h2>
<p>From a making perspective, VR also affords humanities students with unique opportunities for critical inquiry, interpretation, and reflection. Neville et al. (<a href="#neville2020">2020</a>) write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The research required for developing culturally sensitive, ethical, and historically accurate immersive digital content is both demanding and comprehensive. Compared to research methodologies privileging linear subject matter presentations, such as a term paper or a video, research for VR projects compels students to consider how elements of their chosen topic function together as an interconnected, object-oriented activity system<br>
<a href="#neville2020">para. 4</a>.<br>
Our students engaged with primary and secondary sources to understand what life was like for survivors under the Occupation. They used these resources to interpret the ways survivors saw, understood, and felt about key locations around Paris and make decisions about what information to highlight. They considered how others would engage with their 360º recording and needed to think about point of view and where and how to position the camera. <sup id="fnref2:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> writes:  “…the most important decision is where to position the camera within the environment, in order to provide the viewer with a realistic and clear point of view. This point of view is decidedly humanist and comes from an understanding of person and place”   <sup id="fnref3:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. This aligned with the goals for the course and the need to see and articulate these spaces in new ways with the survivors’ memories and point of view at the center.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> continue,  “Student roles shift from being passive recipients of knowledge to co-creators in the learning experience. These shifts allow team members to learn from each other as they integrate their own discipline knowledge and methods into the project”   <a href="#neville2020">para. 4</a>. We encouraged students to take ownership of and invest personally in the project. These histories and memories required care, and the survivors and the instructor trusted the students as collaborators. Their contributions were then integrated into the instructor’s digital maps locating the survivors’ childhood geographies; the map is used as an open educational tool for future classes as well as the general public. Throughout this creation process, students were also able to see knowledge production at work:  “Just as the creator of the virtual representation must make choices about how ‘real’ to make their visualization (what to include and exclude), so the historian makes choices regarding what data to include and how that data is represented”   <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Students came to understand that their recordings were subject to their own bias and interpretation and that their directorial decisions really mattered and impacted the way others would experience this history. This became especially apparent after they shared several meetings with survivors and received feedback on their work. <sup id="fnref2:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> write,  “XR positions students as analysts as well as creators of commemorative landscapes, alert to the relations of power and influence that shape these constructions, both virtual and physical”   <a href="#lueck2020">para. 29</a>. Our team’s preparation in the classroom, both with immersive technologies and historical and cultural coursework, allowed us to embark on what would be a life-changing journey for instructor, librarians, students, and survivors alike.</p>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<h2 id="course-context">Course Context</h2>
<p>Each year, this course is offered as an advanced French History and Culture course through the French and Francophone Studies program. Yet, in fall 2019, a second section was opened to non-French speaking students and an eight-day trip to Paris was conducted after the end of the semester. The course description reads:</p>
<p>In this course, we will explore the dark years of the Vichy Regime&rsquo;s collaboration with Nazi Germany. Thus, we will be exploring a past that none of us has experienced directly. And not just any past: a past which was repressed, covered, disguised. A past full of shadows. A past only spoken of in whispers. A past recalled by memories with gaping holes. In short, the myth of the  <em>Résistance</em>  only fascinates briefly before the reality of the camps sets in, and one becomes too petrified with fear to continue looking back.</p>
<p>How  <em>can</em>  one talk about what happened? What words  <em>can</em>  one use to tell the story of the missing? These were some of the challenges faced by the post-Auschwitz society. This is the challenge of the course [&hellip;]</p>
<p>“I do not  <em>hear</em>  what she says.”  The lexical confusion of a student whose mother tongue is Spanish was the crucial moment. Translating  <em>entender</em>  (to understand) by the French  _entendre _ (to hear) to explain that she did not understand what the author said in her diary written in 1942 made sense. The apparent mistake conjured up a series of fundamental questions: How to understand a story if you do not hear the voice that tells it? How to make sense of words pronounced by voices without context? How to envisage Paris under the German Occupation without knowing its space?</p>
<h2 id="mendingminding-holes-with-digital-technology">Mending|Minding Holes with Digital Technology</h2>
<h2 id="digital-map-of-wwii-paris-1">Digital Map of WWII Paris 1.</h2>
<p>To better answer these questions, Mélanie, in collaboration with the Penn Libraries and the Price Lab for the Digital Humanities, first made an <a href="https://pennds.org/melanieperon/neatline/fullscreen/test-exhibit">interactive digital map</a> of WWII Paris. First, they purchased a vintage 1940 paper map on eBay for 5 euros and both scanned and georectified it. Then, they created an Omeka<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  site to host the digital map and its ancillary documents. Finally, using Neatline,<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  Mélanie and her student Kyra Schulman geolocated 240 key historical places and identified with a description of the place pre-war, during the war, and post-war. Each pin comes with a picture and, when possible, excerpts from selected memoirs, contemporary press articles, and videos from the French national archives.</p>
<p>This stitched-together spatial visualization of history aimed to reduce the historical and psychological distance which separates us from then/them. For instance, one could tell students in lecture that 13,000 Jews, most of whom lived in East Paris, were rounded up on July 16, 1942, and taken to a velodrome located in West Paris before being sent to concentration camps. It would not trigger the same understanding of history as showing them on the map where the velodrome stood. Once they see how close it was to the Eiffel Tower, held as a symbol of modernity and culture, they understand how unfathomable the event was at the time and still is. It also enables them to wonder how Parisians could say they did not know when many of them must have witnessed the day-long procession of buses. These were questions post-war France had to face, too.</p>
<p>While famous Parisian locations are already known to most students, the map acts as an X-ray of the city summoning the untold narratives hidden behind these places. As Patrick Modiano, who received the Nobel prize for  “the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the Occupation,” ” <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>, explained in his Oslo speech:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] in my youth, to help me write, I tried to find the old Parisian telephone directories, especially the ones that listed names by street with building numbers. I had the feeling as I turned the pages that I was looking at an X ray of the city – a submerged city like Atlantis – and breathing in the scent of time.<br>
<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><br>
Neatline makes the ontological connections between the temporal layers literally visible, further supporting Modiano’s palimpsest metaphor. As a matter of fact, upon logging into the map, for a few seconds, one can witness different layers overlap, the WWII map coming together and eventually laying over the current map of Paris. In this specific instance, digital technology reminds the user to read between the lines and look beyond the surface, which are elemental inquisitive principles leading to understanding. The visualization of the underlying imbricating process also illustrates the inherent preservation capacity of digital technology, fixing our artifacts in a social collective memory, as opposed to the idea of deletion and obsolescence often associated with digital platforms. Finally, by placing the map on the open web, not restricted by copyright and hidden behind paywalls, it allows for serendipitous discovery. It provides access to a wider audience, not just to those who have access to institutional resources or are otherwise connected to scholarly endeavors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="immersive-voices-from-the-past-2">Immersive Voices from the Past 2.</h2>
<p>The course material includes the testimonies of Arlette Testyler, Francine Christophe, and Rachel Jedinak left with the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive (VHA). The three survivors lived in Paris before and during part of the war before being interned, deported, or hidden. In July 2019, Rachel took the instructor to her childhood neighborhood and walked her through the terrible day of July 16, 1942, when the French police arrested her with her mother and sister. Unlike their mother, the two young girls were fortunate to escape from the Bellevilloise, where Jews were held before being bused to the Vélodrome d’Hiver. Using a 360° camera, Rachel was filmed walking from where her house stood to the Bellevilloise while telling the story of the neighborhood and her family along the way. The makeshift ethnographic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIS_ynEbt_u8fmDAB1_kaHruUS3kXybVA">clips</a> were then added to a digital map dedicated to Rachel. This original experience with VR technology enabled the digital cartographic translation to don a humanity that speaks to us in a way that we can  <em>hear</em>  today. It further inspired the following student-curated digital projects.</p>
<h2 id="from-learners-to-makers">From Learners to Makers</h2>
<p>The digital projects were not introduced as assignments, but rather as lasting contributions students were going to make to the course, to the Shoah studies and, more importantly, to the people whose stories we were going to transcribe. From the first day of class, students knew they were not going to receive concrete grades based on prescriptive rubrics. Instead, they had a timeline to help them manage their workflow and received personal detailed emails to guide them on their respective works. After returning from Paris, they had two weeks to finalize their projects. The final grade system was binary: A if the work was completed; B if it was not. The class dynamic was built on the honor pledge everyone involved in the projects made to each other and themselves — we were going to work and do our best for  <em>them</em> , the people whose stories we wanted to be heard and preserved in a social collective memory.</p>
<h2 id="mapping-memory-1">Mapping Memory 1.</h2>
<p>On campus, the students were asked to curate <a href="https://pennds.org/melanieperon/exhibits/show/vha/rachel-jedinak">a webpage</a> for a survivor from the Shoah Foundation VHA. The webpage had to include a biography, pictures, the transcription of the testimony and a digital map locating the key places mentioned. In groups of four to five, the students from the French section were entrusted with the stories of Arlette, Francine, and Rachel. The students from the English section, in pairs, had to find VHA testimonies made in English from survivors who, at the time of the war, lived in Paris. Two pairs were able to get in touch with their subject — via phone conversations for one group and in person for the other group — after conducting research on their own. All students received training on how to use Omeka and Neatline (Appendix A). The purpose was for their pages to be added to the Omeka course site and to subsequently become part of future course material. Students were asked to reflect on their roles in shaping these digital histories and to be thoughtful with the design aspects of their survivors’ pages and maps. Finally, they learned how to populate a map on Neatline using the items they had archived on Omeka.</p>
<p>One class meeting was also dedicated to teaching students how to use the Parisian public transportation system from the hotel they would be staying at to the various places connected to their survivor’s story. It was important to create a déjà-vu feeling once they arrived in Paris. While in Paris, students were asked to go back to all the places they already knew since they had mapped them and gathered corollary documentation to be added to their webpage. The group who met their survivor in the U.S. was in daily contact <a href="https://pennds.org/melanieperon/exhibits/show/vha/nathan-spiewak">with him</a>. They regularly sent him pictures of his former geography to which he never failed to respond providing more historical details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started to cry looking at the photos. Our apartment was on the left 3rd floor on the right side of the stairs. Outside the gate on the left there was a restaurant where my mother used to get food and on the right was a store that sold office supplies. The gate is different and in the court there was [sic] no plants or anything. I am still crying. Please send me the photos that you took of the apartments.<br>
(N. Spiewak, personal communication, January 6, 2020)<br>
Thanks to in-person Q&amp;As scheduled with Francine alone and then with Arlette and Rachel together, the whole class engaged in an intimate dialogue with history through their personal storytelling. The three ladies were amazed and grateful to hear how much their young public already knew about their places of memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mapping project allowed students to physically retrace the steps they had remotely taken on the digital platform. Above all, it enabled them to literally walk in the survivors’ steps. Despite the changes the streets underwent through time, the students were anachronistic reminders of the stories that took place under today’s facades and are forgotten by many. They became archiving connectors between then and now, peeling off the superimposed layers covering what was once the reality of their survivors.</p>
<h2 id="recording-memory-landscape-2">Recording Memory Landscape 2.</h2>
<p>In the second half of the semester, the class read  <em>Sur la Scène Intérieure</em>  ( <em>On the Inner Stage</em> ) by Marcel Cohen (2013). It tells the story of his family members who never came back from deportation. Through his memories as a five-year-old boy and the objects that belonged to his loved ones, he takes the reader to the Parisian places and personal realms which delineated his childhood. After the text was discussed in class, students were divided into four cross-section groups. Each chose one particular place described in the book that they wanted to film with a 360° camera in Paris.</p>
<p>We chose 360° as our medium in part because the consumer-grade cameras (Appendix B) proved to be very accessible for new users. Most immersive technologies have a steep learning curve and require lengthy periods of time for the creation process. We had only a week in Paris and a full program, of which the 360° project was just one part. <sup id="fnref3:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> recommend  “modest contributions”  and a more  “incremental process”  that enable  “more care, more caution, and, ultimately, a more collaborative framework going forward”  (<a href="#lueck2020">para. 5</a>). Our project benefited from this approach as well as it allowed the students enough time to grasp the technology, to make and fix mistakes, to get feedback, and to edit their projects.</p>
<p>On campus, students received training using Insta360 One X cameras (Appendix B) and then editing the recordings (Appendix C). Once in Paris, over the course of four days, students <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIS_ynEbt_u-7N2IRHaYp8T5G9EqNCOZQ">filmed</a> and edited a raw version of their videos. Through the creation of the documentaries, students were in dialogue with Cohen’s text, interpreting and capturing the space through his words. The use of 360° cameras enabled students to reconstruct these spaces — albeit transformed by time — more authentically for viewers, providing them with an impression of how these spaces impacted the author. This created a dynamic triad of author, students, and viewer in which all have agency. On the one hand, the author’s narration accompanied the 360° video and determined filming locations; on the other, students interpreted his words through the filming and editing of 360° experiences while the viewer in a VR headset chooses how to engage these experiences — unhindered by framing boundaries to a degree.</p>
<p>At the end of each filming day, students edited their footage. They were asked to select clips to show the author later that week. The group that filmed the itinerary that Marcel Cohen took to visit his mother awaiting deportation in the Rothschild Hospital wanted to be creative. They originally shot a clip, in which one of them posed as his mother. However, due to its potentially triggering nature, we asked them not to demo this clip. When we met the author at his home, he asked Mélanie to read aloud excerpts he had selected from his book and other personal documents, explaining he was passing his voice onto her. At that moment, Cohen directly invited  _us _ into  <em>his</em>  story and willingly became an active participant in  <em>our</em>  project — coming full circle. He then generously answered our questions and agreed to put on the Oculus VR headset and watched the first video, filmed in the Parc Monceau, one of the places to which he seldom goes back. After an initial reaction of wonder, the little-boy-turned-old-man was visibly moved, removed the headset, and thanked us. He did not want to see more. This moment was a reminder that our use of immersive tools comes with ethical responsibilities. As much as this virtual spatial translation can lead to a deeper understanding of the text by the reader, one must bear in mind it can also trigger anxiety in the subject/author of the text. Following this encounter, the  “creative group”  agreed on their own  “it would not be right”  to keep their acting scene. This decision-making was an example of how the students gained perspective and empathy and grew through the heuristic process.</p>
<p>Critical making evokes a shared sense of responsibility for work that exists beyond itself and its impetus for creation, existing in an interconnected web of relationships. This realization became clearer after the poignant meeting with the author, in which the group was immersed in his home, his hospitality, and his feedback. Once again, students became active collaborators of the course since the recordings were eventually embedded on the <a href="https://pennds.org/melanieperon/neatline/fullscreen/marcelcohen">digital map</a> dedicated to the author’s life during the war and will be used as course material in the future as an alternative reading method of Cohen’s text.</p>

<p>As <sup id="fnref4:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> emphasizes, the transition from user to maker is essential for students to find meaning through their digital projects. Before learning the making technologies utilized in the course — Omeka/Neatline and 360° cameras and software — students were asked to assess their own experiences learning technology in the classroom, applying technology to their projects and, finally, the overall utility or effectiveness of the technology to their project objectives (Appendix D). A survey on Google Forms was administered by the instructor to students via email in the fall 2019 semester as digital projects were underway. Students were informed that survey responses would remain anonymous and would in no way impact their individual or project grades. Of the 22 students in the class, 18 students responded to the questions in the Technology Effectiveness Survey, Part I (Appendix E).</p>

<p>As Figure 1 demonstrates, most students found it easier to create and apply digital content to their own projects after having learned the material in a hands-on workshop. Unsurprisingly, Neatline proved to be the most challenging of the technologies, as students had to navigate both layers — modern-day and 1940s-Paris — of the digital map. Most students found Omeka and Neatline effective for telling their survivor’s story.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, many students found making VR recordings even easier than when they were learning about them in the workshop. Overwhelmingly, students rated making these videos very effective for conveying Marcel Cohen’s story. One student wrote in the survey comments,  “When you put on the VR goggles, it feels as though you are being placed in the middle of his story and walking with him through the places of his childhood,”  harkening back to the core principle of empathy that the instructor intended as a pedagogical goal in using this technology to create and then preserve the collective memory of this project.</p>
<p>Although students perceived the technology as effective in carrying out their project goals, inevitable and various technical obstacles triggered obvious frustration upon use. Upon returning from Paris, students were asked to complete a second survey, Technology Effectiveness Survey, Part II, to evaluate the utility of the technologies in completing their final projects (Appendix F). The instructor emailed the Google Forms survey to the students; they were again informed that results would be kept anonymous and that their responses would in no way affect their grades. This survey’s free-form responses emphasized that problem-solving processes served as pathways of learning, reminding us all how unclarity, unfairness, unanswerable questions are part of life and how recognizing it is the first step to  “build it better”   <sup id="fnref5:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, as one student responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The experience of shooting 360° videos allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the places with which Marcel Cohen interacted as a child. While filming the videos was not a simple task, and we encountered several challenges along the way, I nonetheless learned so much from the entire experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the trip to Paris happened during winter break and ended two days before spring semester resumed, students had two weeks to complete their assignments upon returning. With their authorization, the instructor proofread and edited the survivors’ webpages and maps. The 360° videos were also finalized by the instructor before being embedded into a map dedicated to Marcel Cohen. The author declined to record the videos’ voice-over once more entrusting the instructor to be his voice. All the student-curated works will be passed on to the next class as course material. One core agreement is that the students will permanently keep their administrative status on Omeka so they may remain contributors to the memorial palimpsest we stitched together for as long as they choose to.</p>
<h2 id="co-constructivist-dialogue">Co-Constructivist Dialogue</h2>
<p>Through these making projects, students experienced first-hand what the instructor had experienced through her own projects of the original digital map and Rachel Jedinak’s memory walk in 360° in July 2019. The conventional teacher / student binary disappeared to give place to a co-constructivist dialogue.</p>
<p>Students also attained a level of understanding of the texts, and consequently history, difficult to achieve had they not been asked to tinker with the matter with their own hands. For instance, when they located the main places of their survivors’ childhood, they realized how close-knit Arlette’s family was, how Francine Christophe and Marcel Cohen must have crossed paths in the Parc Monceau, and how the mothers of Rachel Jedinak and Georges Perec (whose work  _W or the childhood memory _ (1975) is studied in class) might have known each other by sight. In response to questions in Part II of the survey (Appendix F), one student wrote,  “Creating the [survivor] testimony and page and map was undoubtedly a meaningful experience, and definitely brought me closer to my [survivor]’s story and course content. Creating the page and mapp [sic] allowed us to delve deeper into our [survivor]’s story and bring to life an aspect of our [survivor]’s childhood/story in a creative manner.”</p>
<p>Filming Marcel Cohen’s memories made them read the text differently. They were, in fact, put in situations which led them to read between and behind the lines, as another student’s survey response shows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walking through the hustle and bustle of Paris from his home to the Cabaret, to the brasserie, to the park was physically exhausting, which I feel made me reflect on what it might have been like to be a child walking this route. Questions popped into my mind like, ‘Was he tired or energetic to get to the park?’ It was only something I would have thought of if I didn’t get the experience to shoot the video.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Literally walking in the little boy’s shoes triggered a level of empathy, and therefore understanding, that would have eluded most ways of reading, as another student elaborated in survey comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This experience allowed me to a [sic] have a more three-dimensional image/perspective of the specific memories Marcel Cohen recounts in his book. While reading the stories in the book in itself is a touching/moving experience, tracing Marcel’s footsteps in person really helped me to bring to life the passages from the book. Reading the stories is one type of experience, but actually seeing the places mentioned in the book and visually processing the stories is [a] whole other experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The students’ comments to Part II of the survey underline the importance of making an abstraction relatable by making one care and that the technology was essential to see themselves as part of the narrative.</p>
<h2 id="epistolary-and-lasting-exchanges">Epistolary and Lasting Exchanges</h2>
<p>One unforeseen, and yet so poetically apropos, outcome of the projects is the epistolary exchanges that ensued after our trip to Paris. Upon our return, five students resorted to a practice so long forgotten by most of them to express their gratitude to the older people we met. Three students also hand-wrote letters to the instructor. This gesture recalled <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>’s  “creation of novel understandings by the makers themselves”   <a href="#ratto2011b">para. 3</a> and idea of matter of fact vs. matter of concern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had been to Paris a few times before, and it had always been the romantic Paris. A city of love, light, intelligence, art, history, and culture. But I now see a new Paris. The love and the light are not gone though. They are intermingled with a sort of darkness. I had never before noticed any of the plaques on the schools or buildings when walking around Paris. I surely have walked past them before, but I was never looking for them. And so I never saw them. Now, I have something to look for. I am equipped with this knowledge to be able to see both the light and the dark. And it’s not just in Paris. I’m sure there is light and dark everywhere in the world. It just takes a little extra effort to uncover some of the hidden truths. I hope, as someone who is tasked with passing down the stories of the individuals we met, I do a great job at helping others to see such things as well. Not only did I discover a new Paris, but it was as though I almost discovered a new me. Maybe not a new me, but I was able to see things about myself I hadn’t seen before.<br>
(S. Davis, personal communication, January 15, 2020)<br>
I knew [the course] would be magical but I knew not the extent to which I would be forever changed by its teachings. While still processing last week’s trip, I am aware of a new sense of gratitude and compassion within me. That’s what this class and journey was: opening my eyes to the abundance of humanity that is always and everywhere.<br>
(A. Malinovich, personal communication, January 15, 2020)<br>
The gratitude felt by the students was reciprocated by the survivors we met. Within a few days after our return, we received emails and letters from each of them. Francine Christophe’s husband’s handwritten note, in English, was especially touching:  “Sad not to see you again. If one (or two) of you flies to Paris bear in mind that they have friends on the spot [phone number]”  (J.-J. Lorch, personal communication, February 3, 2020). The ninety-year-old man recognized the care students put in the projects they made and therefore acknowledged them as friends to whom he entrusted his most precious possession: his legacy. The learners-turned-makers knocked down walls between generations, reduced distances, and built unexpected friendships. The author Marcel Cohen echoed Mr. Lorch’s words in a handwritten card he sent in response to a student’s letter:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your visit to Paris, your work, your curiosity are extremely precious if one thinks about the future and I don’t doubt you have the ability to make it less dark than the past was. Believe in all my gratitude and my deep friendship.<br>
(M. Cohen, personal communication, February 6, 2020)<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup><br>
The goal of the projects does not end with the course. Not only do all the participants involved in the projects feel a duty to make sure our new old  <em>friends</em> ’ voices can continue to be heard, but they are also aware that their common experience provides them with reading keys they will be able to apply to future situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="further-applications">Further Applications</h2>
<p>Even though the project was first conceived for a foreign language course, it was easily adapted to a humanities course taught in English. Since students received technical training, it was also listed as an elective toward the institution’s minor in digital humanities. While this article describes an iteration of the course with a physical trip to Paris, the subsequent iteration did not. Even though it cannot replace the in-situ tangible atmospheric feel, the preexisting digital map of WWII Paris combined with the embedded 360° videos and Google Map offered a reliable alternative. In the classroom, the successive students were able to follow itineraries and walk in the streets as the former students had a few months prior. They could also move the slider on the Google Map Street View and select a thumbnail to see that same place through time until 2008. This is how the mapping project can fulfill its role as a portal through space and time from within the classroom.</p>
<p>One mission of the project is to preserve the fleeting materiality of human stories. We have been fortunate to be able to literally record the voices and physically meet face-to-face with some of the survivors whose stories we digitally translated. A time will come when it won’t be possible anymore. Yet, the materiality of an existence and recording voices can take other forms, as Serge Klarsfeld, the author of the now searchable  _Memorial to the Jews Deported from France, 1942-1944 _ (<a href="https://www.stevemorse.org/france/">https://www.stevemorse.org/france/</a>), explains in the preface he wrote to the publication of Louise Jacobson’s letters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what is a voice? It can be a particularly poignant letter, written before or after the arrest, which reveals a personality or the strength of a destiny. It can be a look in a photograph that catches your eye and that you will never forget. It can be a simple name of a child in a list of deported adults who leaves, alone, isolated, without his or her parents, and which you must keep in your memory because you cannot abandon him or her too. It can be a drawing that expresses hopes or betrays anguish and sorrow<br>
<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><br>
<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> also reminds us that  “most people for most of human history have not used written language as their major form of expression. They have created meaning, represented the world, and expressed their emotions through textiles, wood, metal, dance, and music. Material culture is simply another vital source of historical knowledge, supplemental to words for those who have had little access to them”   <sup id="fnref1:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. The pedagogic capacity of material culture reassures us that our project not only will be able to keep its relevance even after the survivors are not here anymore but also it shows that the principle of the project can be adapted to topics without living participants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One may also think of Princeton’s Shakespeare and Company project (<a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/">https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/</a>), which catalogs the library cards of Sylvia Beach’s Parisian library. On these rectangular sepia cards, the ink, the handwriting, the list of books conjure up, in a relatable way, a time long gone and one’s vanished existence. Within the same semiotic realm, translating onto a digital platform textiles, graffiti, annotations, letters, to list a few examples of traces left behind by a human being, can open the same interstice between now and then. When no witness is left or when one believes the physical landscape is not legible to us due to substantial changes, one should remember Georges Didi-Huberman’s (2018) injunction in his book about a visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can therefore never say,  “There’s nothing to see, there’s no more to see.”  To be able to doubt what we see, we must know how to keep looking, how to see in spite of everything. Despite the destruction, the erasure, of all things. We must know how to look the way an archaeologist looks. And it’s by way of such a gaze – such an interrogation – directed toward what we see that things begin to look at us from their concealed spaces and bygone time. (&hellip;) The destruction of beings does not mean they are departed. They’re here, they are indeed here: here in the flowers of the fields, here in the birches’ sap, here in this tiny pond where lie the ashes of thousands dead<br>
<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><br>
​​Nature, materials left behind can still connect  <em>us</em>  to  _them _ while digital humanities can anchor their existence back in time and space, with immersive technology recreating the stories of objects and their human voices.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The digital humanities projects presented in this article opened an interstice into the fabric of time and space which enables the participants and anyone accessing their products to connect with a distant past and a faraway place. Like Medusa, the Shoah petrifies and like Perseus, one needs a shield to confront it. The projects became the shields the instructor and the students forged in order to approach a frightening part of history and draw personal lessons from it. The back-and-forth movement between past and present, historical narratives and individual testimonies, national and personal, reading and making encouraged them to not only  _consider _ the time period but also to  <em>be considerate</em>  towards those who lived it. It enabled them to feel empathy towards people and a time they could not  <em>hear</em>  at first. Their endeavors put on the map the unheard stories of invisible strangers, stitched together scattered narratives, and weaved an infinite constellation connecting that past to our current present. They learned to take into consideration the humanity of others, to recognize themselves in others and others in themselves. A philanthropic knowledge they can further apply to other invisible, voiceless individuals from other places who live around us today.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, the authors would like to argue that the students who, with nothing but care, tinkered with the stories of strangers were all at once curators, cartographers, printmakers, videographers and, most importantly, critical makers, who benevolently participated in Klarsfeld’s collecting of voices. As <sup id="fnref5:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> emphasizes that  “there is an important need for critical makers that can reintegrate technical and social work and thereby innovate both”   <sup id="fnref6:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, we hope that enabling students as makers in this course, which is one of praxis, bridging the theory and the practice, has prepared them to take such a sociocultural and innovative approach to their own future endeavors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If literary studies is to survive the twenty-first century, it will need to reinvigorate its ambitions and methods by forging closer links to the study of other media rather than clinging to ever more tenuous claims to exceptional status.<br>
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>   <br>
By the first decade of the new millennium, evidence was mounting that the ‘high theory’ of ideology critique had played itself out as literary studies’ governing paradigm <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> . <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  The energy and sense of liberation that had propelled successive waves of structuralist, post-structuralist, Marxist, feminist, postcolonial, new-historicist, and queer theory in the academy seemed to have reached a point of diminishing returns. Once revolutionary modes of analysis had ossified into rote posturing, with talk of radical revisioning oddly transmuted into received wisdom. This sense of a discipline in stasis was not only intellectual but also institutional — existential even. Universities’ political paymasters and research-funding bodies have increasingly insisted that disciplines demonstrate their vocational utility and real-world ‘impact’. Undergraduates, voting with their feet, indirectly registered the same message via declining enrolments, while graduate students — surveying a parlous academic job market — opted for other, presumably safer, careers <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  This already precarious disciplinary status quo was then massively destabilized by the COVID-19 pandemic’s shock to higher-education systems worldwide as revenue from international students collapsed in the face of travel bans and local lockdowns. In a discipline long prone to gloomy prognostications about its future, English scholars of even a more optimistic cast had to admit, by 2020, that the doomsayers really did have a point ( <em>Endgame</em> , 2020).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Against this post-millennial background, engagement with the digital world seemed a logical pivot for the humanities, given information and communication technologies’ wholesale transformation of all aspects of contemporary western life since mainstreaming of the internet in the early 1990s. For literary studies in particular though, this turn to the digital came freighted with heavy baggage. Mid-1990s ‘death of the book’ discourse had pitted an all-conquering ‘electronic literature’ (eLit) against an ostensibly obsolete print medium, and had left many literary humanists with an active distaste for digital triumphalism <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Strategic errors made by digital boosters in positing the digital as implacable rival and inevitable successor to print had served to polarize debate and made it harder to adopt middle-ground positions. As it transpired, eBooks and the printed codex negotiated an uneasy marketplace modus vivendi, but traditional literary scholars and former eLit enthusiasts were slower to do likewise. The rise of Digital Humanities (DH) discourse from around 2005 threatened a repeat of 1990s hostilities, this time with adherents of quantitative ‘distant reading’ at loggerheads with advocates of traditional hermeneutic close reading, who accused their adversaries of not reading at all <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I have no intention here of buying into such stale, polarized, and unproductive debates. Indeed, superseding them is the starting point for the present discussion. In spite of the self-presentation of both eLit advocates and DH-ers as radical agents of change, their reconfigurations of the literary studies discipline have, if anything, not gone far enough. Both approaches remain essentially text-centric, differing principally on whether a niche group of very recent texts is painstakingly interpreted, or a large corpus of often obscure historical texts is digitally skimmed. Broader questions of how digital technologies might reconfigure academe’s now century-old literary studies project by looking beyond the text to an encompassing socio-economic reality remain largely unasked.</p>
<p>At the outset of the present discussion, some definitional clarification seems in order. In talking about ‘digital literary studies’ I denote principally literary works, deploying whatever medium, created since the late decades of the twentieth century. These have been produced, circulated, and consumed in the context of a digital literary sphere (however much the parameters of that sphere have expanded and its agents have multiplied over subsequent decades). But, by extension, much of the following argument about practising a ‘literary media studies’ is also relevant to analyzing literature produced in earlier, pre-digital eras, with due allowance being made for the varying medial environments and socio-economic contexts of specific periods and geographical locations. It is a broadly sociological, media-aware disposition I am advocating, not one with strict chronological cut-off points.</p>
<p>Currently, our intellectual schemas for making sense of the digital paradigm’s epochal impact on literary culture remain inadequate. Digital literary studies continues to miss the larger significance of digital technologies for contemporary literary culture because it takes either too micro or too macro a perspective. On one hand, studies of eLit have existed since the late 1980s, and focus on close-reading individual born-digital texts, usually of an avant-garde nature with at best coterie audiences. On the other hand, the last decade and a half has seen the efflorescence of DH approaches which machine-read extensive historical literary corpora to gauge large-scale statistical trends in genre, authorship, and nationality. However much their chronological frame differs, the guiding methodology remains at some level hermeneutic. Thus, DH scholar Alan Liu may be correct in his claim that  “the contrast between the practices of close reading and the digital humanities is so stark that it is changing the very nature of the ground being fought over: the text”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Yet, text-centrism of either stripe still mostly disregards the material world beyond the text itself: the agents of production, circulation, and consumption; the commercial context of the book trade; and the legal, political, and cultural policy frameworks that impinge upon or facilitate the flow of texts.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  While often exemplary research about this intermediate space does exist (see below), it is currently scant and scattered, too often existing as a corrective to the main currents of eLit or DH research rather than, as should be the case, constituting the starting point for an overarching reorientation of the literature-media interface around sociological concerns. We are thus left, in an era of rapid book-world changes, with a troublingly partial understanding of how digital technologies are transforming the very  <em>institutionality</em>  of contemporary, mainstream literature.</p>
<p>To resolve this impasse, we urgently require what John Frow, discussing the future of literary sociology, terms a ‘mid-level concept’ (<a href="#frow2013">2013, [2010]</a>) — namely, an analytical framework straddling, on one hand, innumerable individual literary texts and, on the other, the unwieldy abstraction that is ‘literature’ <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Literary studies has attempted, over its roughly century-long institutional history, to fill this ‘mid-level’ space with various organizing schema: periodization; genre categories; and diachronic accounts of national literatures <sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. But these too remain near-exclusively text-centric. The  <em>why</em>  and  <em>how</em>  of literature’s arrival on the scholar’s desk for painstaking close-reading are factored out of analysis, and the text’s relationship to an abstractly configured form of identity politics has, in recent decades, dominated proceedings. The still too-often hazy technological and institutional apparatus that moves a given book into the scholarly ambit and makes it available for close-reading I here dub the ‘meso’ space.</p>
<p>I borrow this terminology from the field of economics where scholars since the 1980s have also proposed a mid-level category to bridge that discipline’s traditional bifurcation into microeconomic and macroeconomic frames <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. The aim of such renegade economists is to capture those political-economic forces governing the space between individual economic actors and the broader structures within which they operate. Largely in parallel, a conceptually cognate ‘new institutionalism’ has, since the early 1990s, also emerged within the discipline of sociology <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. It has a similar interest in ‘mid-level’ or ‘meso’ intermediaries that shape cultural phenomenon (for example, commercial organizations, public-sector entities, regulatory frameworks, social networks) and which exhibit a strong degree of self-perpetuating autonomy. Such an institutional focus helps integrate the abstract totalities of ‘society’ or ‘the economy’ at one extreme and the empirical specificity of atomized individual choices at the other.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  The approach also evinces a refreshing self-consciousness that the level of reference chosen for analysis profoundly influences the research questions formulated, the types of evidence sought, and the resulting conclusions <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p>By analogy, in the literary studies context, the various institutions of authorship, publishing, retailing, reviewing, and readership provide compelling ‘mid-level’ analytical frames for compiling thick descriptions of precisely  <em>how</em>  digital media are fundamentally reconceptualizing literary culture.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  The attractive relativism of the meso approach avoids, in this context, both the sweeping technological determinism of medium theory and the futile insularity of individual case-studies unmoored to larger theoretical schema. Vitally, the new institutionalism illuminates that literary entities are not mere externalities of an aesthetically autonomous literary culture; they are constitutive of it in that they profoundly influence what achieves recognition  <em>as</em>  ‘literature’. Literary studies’ long preoccupation with the linguistic minutiae of the textual artefact thus needs supplementing with sociological awareness of the  <em>material</em>  world beyond the text (in the word’s dual technological and economic senses), without pitting the two perspectives against each other or subordinating one to serve as mere illustration of the other’s explanatory paradigms. The way out of literary studies’ currently troubled, defensive pass as outlined at this article’s opening is thus multi-step: firstly, to reconceive the discipline in cultural-sociological terms. Secondly, to investigate how the current wave of accelerating digitization is changing that sociological context. And thirdly – as I sketch in this article’s final section – to use the opportunity provided by these contextual changes to rethink literary studies in far-reaching ways: its objects of study; institutional settings; analytic methods; potential publics; and pedagogical practices.</p>
<h2 id="digital-literary-studies-the-current-state-of-play">Digital literary studies: The current state of play</h2>
<p>Before diving into such subtopics and appropriate methodologies for exploring the digital literary studies meso space, it is instructive first to provide a fuller picture of the current state of play regarding both eLit and DH. Specifically, it is enlightening to examine how these fields may be currently shifting or even, tentatively, converging. DH has emerged as a prime area of research renewal and public interest in the humanities in the wake of high theory <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. The field builds upon mid-twentieth-century work in stand-alone humanities computing, but reorients it for the networked and Web 2.0 environments comprising the core of contemporary media and communications. It makes explicit the humanities’ continuing relevance for twenty-first-century culture and society, rejecting inherited notions of a qualitatively-oriented humanities as epistemologically opposed to quantitative computing technologies <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Refreshingly, DH also moves humanistic methods away from critique as the end-point of analysis towards the building of research tools usable by others, including the general public <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Literary studies has long been at the forefront of DH initiatives, with digital literary studies representing one of its most fertile subfields <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Partly this is due to literary studies’ long history with computing technologies dating back to the 1960s mainframe era (bibliographic textual editing, concordances, stylometry, and author attribution). Partly also it is because literary studies is among the most textual and word-based of humanities disciplines and therefore a natural match for logocentric computing technologies <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. While digital literary studies constitutes a broad church, the dominant strand involves data-mining and visualizing of vast corpora of digitized print works from, predominantly, the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which are used to highlight trends by author, date, nationality, genre, or keyword <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Largely in parallel with these developments, since the late 1980s information and communication technologies have disturbed literary studies’ default assumptions by demonstrating that the printed codex is not literature’s sole and inevitable platform. Scholars of eLit have investigated how network structures such as hypertext facilitate multilinear narratives, reconfiguring relationships between author, text, and reader, as well as reconceptualizing texts as mutable and evolving — -‘processural’ in Astrid Ensslin’s phrasing <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. Conversely, such research has rendered newly visible the linear logic and particular affordances of the  <em>print</em>  medium through a salutary process of defamiliarization <sup id="fnref1:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While both digital creative works and computer-powered research tools have made their presence felt in contemporary literary studies, the two fields have tended to operate in parallel. As Martin Paul Eve differentiates,  “to read  <em>digital</em>  or electronic literature closely…is not the same as close reading literature,  <em>digitally</em> ”   <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Scholars of born-digital works largely congregate under the banner of the international Electronic Literature Organization (ELO) and produce belletristic, frequently fine arts-inflected, close-readings of experimental digital works, almost all of which have readerships largely confined to the community of their creation. Whereas scholars deploying digital tools to perform quantitative analyses of large historical corpora tend to congregate variously at Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations-sponsored meets or the US-dominated Modern Language Association’s Digital Humanities special interest group, and to publish in journals such as  <em>Cultural Analytics</em> .<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  Leading terrestrial sites of this second, principally quantitative arm of digital literary studies research — such as the Stanford Literary Lab (formerly led by Franco Moretti) and McGill University’s .txtLAB (directed by Andrew Piper) — are mostly North American-based and, for reasons of US copyright, confine their research to pre-twentieth-century literary history <sup id="fnref1:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. This leaves DH scholars with surprisingly little to say about the structures through which  <em>contemporary</em>  creative literary works circulate. While the ELO is more international in its membership, with significant nodes in Scandinavia as well as North America, it has the opposite problem: its preferred procedure of close-reading highly contemporary works is plagued by hardware and software obsolescence. This results in a discipline forever trying to shore up its scholarly memory <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. These twin challenges leave the impact of the digital realm on  <em>contemporary</em> ,  <em>mainstream</em>  literary cultures chronically under-examined.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup></p>
<p>While this sketch of the digital literary research landscape is accurate in its generalities, there are promising recent signs that both eLit and DH scholars are starting to acknowledge the missing ‘meso’ level. Richard Jean So’s  <em>Redlining Culture</em>  (2021) undertakes quantitatively-informed analysis of how ‘minority authors’ have been consistently marginalized in the historical workings of the ‘U.S. literary field’ <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. But he nevertheless introduces his book with an overview of accelerating conglomeration among US trade publishers over the second half of the twentieth century. It is a welcome DH avowal that  “the economics of American literature — production, reception, and recognition”  emphatically matter <sup id="fnref1:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. By looking outside of the text and observing how digitization transformed the entire book production and retailing industries via word-processing software and point-of-sale stock-monitoring technologies, So makes a vital connection between the material and institutional contexts in which literature was produced and the digital programs with which we might parse it. The digital ceases to be a neutral tool which we  <em>apply</em>  to texts ex post facto, but a cultural force with which book industry participants were wrestling and which authors were sometimes explicitly addressing in their work <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A further green shoot appearing in the previously barren meso space is the recent explicit rebadging of eLit scholarship as a form of DH. There are precedents for such a maneuver, such as Scott Rettberg’s  “Electronic Literature as Digital Humanities”  chapter for Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens and John Unsworth’s discipline-defining anthology _ A New Companion to Digital Humanities_  (2016). Nevertheless, in practice, most ELO adherents have tended to hold themselves somewhat aloof from post-millennial DH developments, pointedly insisting that their own academic project dates from at least the 1980s. But digital literary studies modes of affiliation are perceptibly now in flux. Dene Grigar, former President of the ELO, co-edited the volume  <em>Electronic Literature as Digital Humanities: Contexts, Forms, and Practices</em>  (2021) which proclaims unambiguously that  “electronic literature  <em>is</em>  digital humanities”   <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. Her echo of the title of Rettberg’s article —  “one of the inspirations for this book”  — underlines eLit’s belated surrender to the rhetorical and institutional pull of the more modish label <sup id="fnref1:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. Taken together, works by the likes of So, Rettberg, and Grigar suggest that previously operative binaries between eLit and DH (contemporary versus historical; qualitative versus quantitative; creative versus analytical) are losing their valency. Their synthesis prompts the enticing question of how much the contours of the digital literary landscape might shift further still.</p>
<h2 id="conspicuous-by-their-absence-technological-institutional-economic-and-social-contexts">Conspicuous by their absence: Technological, institutional, economic, and social contexts</h2>
<p>The lingering lacuna in current conceptualizations of digital literary studies becomes especially apparent when we zoom out to consider the technological, institutional, economic, and social changes underway since the early 1990s adoption of the Internet across western societies. Indisputably, the landscape of contemporary mainstream literature has been transformed. The gatekeeping authority of trade publishers has been partially usurped by self-publishing and crowd-funded publishing initiatives via which anyone may anoint themselves an author. Circulation of literary works and venues for book discussion have been similarly transformed by the rise of born-digital periodicals, internet retailing, social-media book promotion, and online writers’ festivals. Thirdly, consumption of literary culture has been revolutionized by traditionally passive, silent, and anonymous readers using interactive technologies to network in online book clubs and to recast themselves as amateur literary critics via online book review and ratings platforms. Each wave of social-media has been co-opted in turn by a subsector of bookish users to facilitate digital book talk, whether via litblogs, bookTube, bookstagram or, most recently, bookTok. Reader becomes reviewer and, more problematically, de facto publicist and content producer. This last point underlines digital technology’s greatest disruption of codex-based literary culture: how the previously distinct roles of producer, disseminator, and consumer have become impossibly blurred. As various functions in book historian Robert Darnton’s famous ‘Communications Circuit’ are elided, single agents take on multiple, combined roles <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These changes have not, of course, passed un-noticed by academe. Scholars drawn from book history and media archaeology (Matthew Kirschenbaum, Lisa Gitelman, Martin Paul Eve), communication and cultural studies (Ted Striphas) and cultural sociology (J. B. Thompson, Laura J. Miller) have analyzed the significance of the contemporary book world’s pervasive digitization for their respective disciplines. While several of these scholars have backgrounds in literary studies, they nevertheless keep in view the material specificity of the book object, so often rendered a transparent and passive substrate by traditional formalist close-reading approaches. Because of this extra-textual awareness, their works explore the effect of digitization on book culture without the ominous 1990s sense of the entire book format being under threat. For those scholars in the group trained in sociology or communication on the other hand, the pre-eminence of the book as a media format was never an article of faith. Thus, the rise of other media formats signals not ignominious demotion of the book but merely the reorganization of an always-evolving informational ecosystem. The book – let alone the text — is never considered self-sufficient; it is, rather, the locus at which multiple commercial, regulatory, social, and cultural forces converge. To understand the book in the current era is inevitably to be redirected outwards to these larger contexts. It is this invaluable sociological perspective that such scholars bring to contemporary understandings of the book.</p>
<p>Work undertaken to date in this meso zone should be applauded for its willingness to examine digital technologies’ impact on the contemporary literary world. It also, at points, shades into the more DH arm of digital literary studies (for example in So’s recent book or the work of Martin Paul Eve). But here again the conception of the digital’s role appears to be primarily quantitative: harnessing the enumerative power and analytical scale of digital data to ask new ask questions about how Bourdieu’s literary field functions. Proponents of more textually-oriented, quantitative ‘cultural analytics’ approaches, such as Piper, are careful to pre-empt objections from those schooled in literary critique by stating that distant reading is not ( <em>pace</em>  Moretti) a substitute for close-reading, but rather a filtering tool and complement for detailed textual analysis <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. In the view of such self-styled academic bridge-builders, the two methods represent ‘commensurable’ approaches <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Yet such work has been less ready to ask  <em>qualitative</em>  questions of the digital paradigm itself, specifically, how the rise of digitization affects the inter-relationship of traditional agents in the literary field. As a result, the digital tends to feature as transcendent — a neutral, external tool invoked to aid analysis but not itself complicit in the economic or sociological framing of the object of study. Where the textual corpus chosen is largely historical, this factoring out of the digital’s agentic role may be defensible, though it occurs also in contemporary-focused work. For example, Laura B. McGrath, in a study of the late twentieth- and twenty-first-century book world, has illuminatingly deployed quantitative DH methods to reveal how US publishers overwhelmingly use ‘comparable title’ data from white authors when estimating likely sales for manuscripts under consideration, to the detriment of writers of color <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. Yet, her analysis is more an ex-post-facto study of the top 500 titles used for ‘comping’ by the current book industry than of the impact of rapid and ongoing datafication on the industry itself. The problem, she implies, lies more with the composition of the specific  <em>corpus</em>  of comp titles chosen than with the act of ‘data-driven acquisitions’  <em>per se</em>   <sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. Accordingly, the digital still functions primarily as a neutral aid for scholarly examination, rather than featuring as itself the object of critical study.</p>
<p>Despite much evidence of vibrancy in the digital literary studies space, mainstream literary studies has been predominantly silent about the impact of the digital within the contemporary book world.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  US scholar Jim Collins (a Notre Dame professor with, significantly, joint appointments in Film and Television as well as English) memorably pinpoints this omission. In a 2013 interview, Collins spoke of his frustration at not being about to pose the kinds of production- and consumption-oriented questions in his English classes that he habitually would in his media studies courses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…you should look beyond the classroom if you are talking about contemporary fiction. The last couple of times I did the postmodern fiction class…I realized that Amazon and adaptations and Oprah Winfrey – they were like the pink elephant in the room, that everybody knew was there, but nobody really knew how to talk about, and so  <em>we just stayed with the text</em>  and talked about literary style and individual genius and postmodern historiography and things like that. So it was that sense of dissatisfaction. What are we missing by not talking how literary fiction circulated, how it could become part of day-to-day life, for everyone, not just for the literary critics and my students? It seemed to me that if we wanted to really understand contemporary reading cultures, we had to do that as well.<br>
<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup> <br>
To remedy this anomalous situation, Collins proposed what he dubs  “literary cultural studies”   <sup id="fnref1:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. This, like cultural studies, would take issues of technological, institutional, economic, and social context seriously. Text and context would be held in dynamic relationship, posited as mutually constitutive, without superimposing the epistemological claims of one discipline on the other <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>. It can thereby avoid the sociological absolutism that has bedeviled many previous parleys between the literary studies and sociology disciplines, in which literature is allotted the thankless task of ‘proving’ sociological precepts <sup id="fnref2:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. Discernible behind Collins’s remarks is du Gay et al.’s famous ‘Circuit of Culture’ model from their 1997 book about the Sony Walkman. In this widely-influential cultural studies diagram, the textual representation of the object remains important for elucidating meaning, but it is contextualized against a much broader background incorporating producer motives, audience behaviors, modes of social-identity facilitation, and forms of regulation. The effect is a 360-degree perspective on the life of a cultural object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase ‘literary cultural studies’ may appear, at first glance, an oxymoron. Cultural studies, in its British and Australian strains, grew of course out of a revolt  <em>against</em>  the exclusive study of a highly limited historical canon of English literature. To the extent that cultural studies has  <em>ever</em>  been interested in analyzing books, it is usually only those works so debased and disparaged in traditional literary studies as to have been rendered symbolically ‘unclean’: pulps; romances; horror; westerns; comics etc. What is radical and refreshing about Collins’s brand of ‘literary cultural studies’ is that it brings the sociological gaze of cultural studies to analyze afresh literary studies’ original object of study: literature. More than this, Collins and his ilk eschew the knee-jerk relativism of cultural studies orthodoxy to parse the concept of ‘literariness’ itself. Here considerations of aesthetic value are not ruled out of bounds at the outset but are instead reconfigured as sociologically brokered: by analyzing, say, the disputes of amateur lit-bloggers, paid book reviewers, and literary academics around a single work we are watching aesthetic evaluation being hammered out in real time by agents wielding differing degrees of economic, institutional, and social capital.</p>
<p>The direct upshot of Collins’s frustration with the prevailing bifurcation of literary and media studies paradigms was his path-breaking monograph  <em>Bring on the Books for Everybody: How Literary Culture Became Popular Culture</em>  (<a href="#collins2010">2010</a>). But the broader project of building a ‘literary cultural studies’ or — in my preferred formulation — ‘literary media studies’ for the digital remains unrealized. This is the ‘meso’ level of digital literary studies alluded to in my title. A meso-level digital literary studies must borrow from cultural sociology’s new institutionalist mindset to account for the influence of contemporary technological, institutional, economic, legal, and social factors which intervene between individual texts and the totalizing abstraction of ‘Literature’. It should take the coexistence and interpenetration of print and digital domains as its intellectual ground and closely analyze the complex flows of content between them. Doing so gives us tools to understand why the ‘literary’ not only continues to exist in a digitally-dominated mediascape (contrary to 1990s predictions), but how users deploy digital media to cultivate specifically  <em>literary</em>  modes of self-presentation: the virtual Goodreads ‘bookshelf’; the artfully curated bookstagram feed; the dark-academia-inflected BookTok persona.</p>
<h2 id="domains-of-disciplinarity-constructing-eng-lit">Domains of Disciplinarity: Constructing ‘Eng. Lit.’</h2>
<p>How did we arrive at the point that sociological understandings lie outside mainstream literary studies’ order of business? The various institutional, epistemological, methodological, and pedagogical choices made from the late decades of the nineteenth century into the early decades of the twentieth century in establishing English literature as an academic specialism have cast long shadows. More particularly, for present purposes, they have inhibited the current discipline’s conceptual repertoire when attempting to analyze contemporary literary works. Before proposing, in this article’s final section, how literary studies might productively open itself up to contemporary digital developments, it is first necessary to trace here key contours of the original ‘Eng. Lit.’ project. My purpose in doing so is to examine both the legacy of those choices and to discern alternative paths not (yet) taken. Decisions made while inventing the new discipline were phenomenally successful in ensuring literary studies’ dominance within humanities divisions during the mid to late twentieth century <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. But, by the twenty-first century, many of these in-built assumptions have grown more hobbling than enabling, and demand re-examining to assess their continued utility.</p>
<h2 id="_object-of-study_"><em>Object of study</em></h2>
<p>Literary studies’ first hurdle was that analyzing English literature appeared too irreducibly subjective a practice to qualify as a legitimate academic subject. Not even requiring mastery of a foreign (or, even better, dead) language, the would-be discipline lacked both intellectual rigor and an established canon, threatening to evaporate into dilettantish impressionism and a disturbingly feminine enthusing over poetry <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>. One strategic counter to these perceived weaknesses was to compile a catalogue of ‘great works’, thereby importing into the fledgling discipline theological traditions of scriptural collation, evaluative winnowing, and hermeneutic scrutiny. Early-twentieth-century formalist celebration of internal complexity and interpretive paradox by critics such as T.S. Eliot led to a preference for condensed literary forms, an intellectual debt repaid by the New Criticism’s championing of Modernist poetry <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>. Literary works were routinely disassociated from their debasingly ‘Philistine’ material production context in the mass market so as to strengthen claims to high art <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>. ‘Close reading’ protocols thus produced a stripped-down textual artefact of the words on the page, variously expressed by proponents as  “the concrete experiences which are poems”  or, still more tersely,  “the text itself”   <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>. New Criticism thus dismissed at a sweep authorial biography, institutional carriage, and socio-cultural reception as so much superfluous encrustation <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>. Similarly, a text’s historical origins were systematically devalued to bolster claims to such works’ timeless relevance <sup id="fnref1:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Literary professors unremittingly discouraged students’ own creative efforts (at least until the burgeoning of creative writing programs in certain, previously marginal, institutions from the mid twentieth century); it was deemed presumptuous for students even to aspire to the hallowed category of Author. Thus the complex processes by which literary works come to be were effectively obscured and mystified. Longstanding critical silence about the formative role played by Modernist literary institutions in the invention of ‘Eng. Lit.’, reinforced by an overwhelming preoccupation with the literary past, served to quarantine the new academic construct from the very sociological forces that brought it into being.</p>
<h2 id="_institutional-setting_"><em>Institutional setting</em></h2>
<p>Where a discipline sits within universities has deep significance for the ontologies and epistemologies it internalizes. The structure of the late-nineteenth-century university in which Eng. Lit. was established had its roots in medieval curricula dominated by Classics, philosophy, and history. This disciplinary triumvirate had only belatedly and grudgingly expanded to incorporate contemporary foreign languages <sup id="fnref1:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Early literary studies’ mode of isolating valued texts from their historical context seems borrowed from Classics and was a conscious attempt to free literature from its subordinate status as an offshoot of history and linguistics in the earlier academic formulation of philology <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. Significantly, literary studies never put down institutional roots in the social sciences – coalescing during this same period – and hence missed those disciplines’ characteristic view of cultural phenomena as sociologically produced <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>. This predisposed Eng. Lit. towards a form of Romanticist creator-worship — disavowed in New Critical theory but avidly reinforced in practice. Individual genius was responsible for bringing great works into being, with the enabling contributions of literary intermediaries (publishers, editors, reviewers, booksellers etc.) reduced to, at best, attendant midwives or, at worst, agents of textual ‘corruption’. The upshot was a radically dematerialized and decontextualized understanding of literary works that was only partially corrected by the waves of ideology critique that transformed literary studies from the 1960s onwards. While such revisionist approaches reconfigured literature as a locus of social power struggles, they overwhelmingly understood cultural politics as conducted at the level of textual representation and interpretation, rarely via material processes of production, circulation, or consumption.</p>
<h2 id="_analytic-mode_"><em>Analytic mode</em></h2>
<p>One especially deleterious legacy of English literature’s institutionalization has been its inability to account for readerly affect. This analytic blind-spot puts it at a grave disadvantage in attempting to explain a digital literary sphere everywhere powered by readers’ emotional investment in books. Academic literary studies’ prime goal of reducing (or appearing to reduce) subjectivism in interpreting literary works was designed to create the appearance of reproducibly ‘scientific’ knowledge. Hence the preference for literary techniques (poetic forms, figures of speech, narrative point of view etc.) that could be taught as transferrable between individual works. The first causality of such a drive for systematism and scientific replicability was readerly subjectivism (the affective fallacy), in that an idealized Reader who served to model preferred interpretations was substituted for actual, individual readers. The second casualty was authorial subjectivism (the intentional fallacy), as examining a literary creator’s motivation was likewise declared intellectually out of bounds <sup id="fnref1:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>. This strategy could largely hold sway in an era where authors had limited technological ability to publicly disseminate their artistic intentions or readers their profusely varied interpretations of texts (cf. <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>). But it is near impossible to maintain when authors commonly use social media channels to commune directly with their readerships and highly affective readerly responses permeate the internet <sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>. In fact, the scale and intensity of readers’ emotional responses to books constitute the very currency of online book culture.</p>
<h2 id="_literary-studies-publics_"><em>Literary studies’ publics</em></h2>
<p>In the domains of object of study, institutional setting, and analytic mode, literary studies was attempting to invent a discipline in something of a vacuum. Yet when it came to the issue of potential audiences for the new discipline, Eng. Lit’s proponents faced the opposite problem: vernacular literary works already had  <em>too much</em>  of a public, namely, the general readership for books and periodicals. Popular readerships tended to view with suspicion these newly self-appointed academic ‘experts’. Worse, vernacular print cultures had long incubated their own arbiters of value in the form of literary reviewers, acquisition editors, and publishers’ readers — all of whom were equally chary of the  <em>arriviste</em>  so-called ‘Vigilant School’ <sup id="fnref:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref3:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>. As a defense, literary studies designed itself as a consciously antiquarian project — unwilling to award contemporary works the laurels of greatness until they had been  “confirmed by time”   <sup id="fnref:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup>. The discipline’s immediate publics, as a direct consequence, became claustrophobically insular: fellow academic literary critics; their graduate students; and the school students their undergraduates progressed to teach in their subsequent careers <sup id="fnref2:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>. An assiduously maintained town-and-gown distinction arose between literary academe and the contemporary book world, at least in so far as its intellectual engine-room was concerned. Credentialed graduates might disseminate New Critical principles and methods among secondary and continuing-education students, or even via textbook publishing, but the line of influence ran only one way.</p>
<p>This situation was, perhaps surprisingly, compounded by the linguistic turn in literary criticism from the 1960s onwards. While proponents of ideology critique championed intellectual movements such as Marxism, feminism, post-colonialism, and queer theory as injecting a necessary socio-political relevance into the study of literature, the abstruse vocabulary in which their ideas were couched was rarely accessible to readers beyond the institution’s walls. So long as literary studies remained relatively confident of its academic position, buoyed by high enrolments against a background of limited alternative humanities offerings, such disengagement from wider literary publics could be perpetuated. But with government funding and rhetorical support for the humanities now under threat across the western world, such habitual insularity appears suicidally short-sighted <sup id="fnref4:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref3:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. A literary studies that cannot demonstrate its relevance to contemporary publics grown accustomed to the rapid interactivity of digital environments and chary of being told what to think by self-appointed critics cannot expect to continue for long.</p>
<h2 id="_professing-the-discipline-of-literature_"><em>Professing the discipline of literature</em></h2>
<p>Any discipline is as much a formative process as it is a given entity; it reveals itself through the habits it inculcates in students, thus naturalizing the choices of an earlier generation as simply &rsquo;the way things are done&rsquo;. As Elaine Showalter neatly sums up this process of academic reproduction: we typically  “do[] unto others as was done unto us”   <sup id="fnref:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup>. In its earliest decades, literary studies pedagogy was dominated by ‘practical criticism’: close-reading seminar exercises; the essay (often read aloud to a tutor); and summative exams <sup id="fnref1:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>. Given the  <em>belles-lettres</em>  origins of the discipline, this choice of the essay as the characteristic assessment form makes some sense, obliging students to hone their writing skills by using  “the best that has been thought and known in the world”  as rhetorical models <sup id="fnref:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup>. At that time, technological platforms and academic enthusiasm for iterative or collaborative forms of assessment were scant, hence the student remained locked into a too-often airless dyad with their lecturer or tutor: drafting and submitting work largely in ignorance of what fellow students were writing or thinking, an isolation exacerbated in Britain by the Oxbridge tradition of one-on-one tutorials <sup id="fnref2:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>. Such one-shot, essay-based, summative forms of assessment have continued as literary studies’ pedagogical norm. Yet now that highly collaborative virtual learning platforms have become undergraduates’ habitual learning environment (and never more so than in the shift to online teaching accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic) maintaining the model of literary education as a process of imitative apprenticeship to the lecturer’s hermeneutic sensibility is manifestly out of date.</p>
<p>In sum, print culture has long constituted literary studies’ unacknowledged condition precedent — the ground for its existence and its presupposed medial norm. Raman Selden’s stunningly offhand comment, in the first edition of his bestselling 1980s literary theory primer, reveals how baked-in this assumption is:  “we may omit the  contact  [i.e. medium] for the purpose of discussing literature; it is not of special interest to literary theorists, since contact is usually through the printed word”   <sup id="fnref:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup>. Deeply embedded assumptions about print’s immutability and transparency explain many of literary studies’ long-evident oversights: its unease with anonymous oral traditions; its tin-ear for drama as performance; and its protracted hostility to subsequently invented filmic and broadcast media. Faced with the rise of digital media from the late 1980s, and especially during the increasingly internet-dominated 1990s, literary studies’ response was, in the main, to double-down on its valorization of print culture. Perceiving digital media as an existential threat, literary studies chose in the main to ignore it, or defanged the new rival by adopting it as helpmeet for print-centric forms of research. For their part, digital advocates hardly helped matters with their ‘death of the book’ zealotry and zero-sum predictions of the medial future <sup id="fnref:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup>. But by the third decade of the twenty-first century, with print and digital media manifestly continuing to coexist, the explanatory inadequacy of such winner-takes-all conceptions is clear. Analysts of the contemporary literary sphere need not nail their colors to either mast, but are instead optimally placed to describe the increased interpenetration and interdependence of digital and literary culture. Doing so promises to open new horizons for the study of literature, potentially securing a future for a discipline sorely in need of good-news stories.</p>
<h2 id="dimensions-of-literary-studies-reconfigured-by-the-digital-literary-sphere">Dimensions of literary studies reconfigured by the digital literary sphere</h2>
<p>I have mentioned various scholars drawn from media archaeology / book history, communication / cultural studies, and cultural sociology who work in the new-institutionalist ‘meso’ space, investigating the interrelationship of print and digital formats, the digitization of contemporary academic and trade publishing, and the dominance of online book retailer Amazon, among other topics. But to read their admirable work, located as it is outside the Eng. Lit. mainstream, is to become uncomfortably aware of how little such meso-level digital analyses have percolated through the discipline of literary studies itself. It is too tempting for scholars, whether a dwindling old guard of literary humanists, the now-dominant proponents of post-1968 ideology critique, or even those most recent Young Turks — DHers themselves — to disregard the piquant implications of such research by filing it under other, sociological disciplinary headings. They thereby miss the crucial significance of the meso space for the future of literary studies itself. A mid-level framework prompts ‘big picture’ questions about how our discipline was originally institutionalized, its current contours and, most importantly, how we might best harness digital technologies to secure its future. Specifically, meso-scale digital literary studies productively throws into question the five key aspects of literary studies’ traditional self-conception outlined above, posing fundamental questions about disciplinary identity.</p>
<h2 id="_what-counts-as-literature_"><em>What counts as ‘literature’?</em></h2>
<p>Not only ‘born-digital’ experimental literary works long championed by the ELO but also new digital paratexts such as audiobooks, book trailers, videos of writers’ talks posted online, amateur readers’ reviews, and book-centric social-media posts expand the definition of ‘literature’, presenting new objects for literary analysis. As texts which both embody literary expression and mediate literature’s role with wider communities (retailers, critics, readers) they pose new questions about the porousness of the literary text and its encompassing social domain. They also foreground the relationship between literary value and economic capital in ways that demand detailed description of the commercial dimension of books rather than the New Critical tactic of simply bracketing it off.</p>
<p>The shift in such texts’ material substrate from print to digital necessitates that literary scholars enact far-reaching changes in theory and method. To comprehend fully the production history, institutional circulation, and consumptive patterns of a given literary work, researchers will have to cast their nets far wider than the codex itself, delving into the less familiar terrain of internet archiving, social-media scraping, and analogue downloads of questionable legality <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. This is assuming that relevant research material lies in the public domain which, given the fiercely data-hungry and proprietorial Amazon’s stranglehold over the contemporary book industry, can never be assumed <sup id="fnref:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup>. Thus, a meso-framed, sociological perspective on twenty-first-century literary objects requires fundamental rethinking of literary studies’ default sources of evidence and its habitual close-reading method. Familiarizing ourselves with research techniques drawn from the rapidly converging media and cultural studies field – interviews and surveys, internet ethnography, algorithmic criticism — is essential given the contemporary book’s place within a converged media landscape. When the industry producing the objects we study changes, so must we.</p>
<h2 id="_where-is-literary-studies-situated_"><em>Where is literary studies situated?</em></h2>
<p>Literary studies, as a traditionally textually-oriented humanities discipline, in past decades engaged in often fractious relations with newer humanities subjects which had a primarily sociological self-conception, notably cultural and media studies. Maintaining such hostilities seems self-defeating when the humanities and social sciences alike face crises of legitimacy, funding, and enrolments, albeit to varying degrees. Rethinking literature sociologically permits us to move past these academic turf-wars to explore what kind of epistemological and institutional configurations best combine strands of humanities and social science expertise, drawing in undergraduate and graduate students from diverse catchments and helping to revitalize the discipline.</p>
<p>To date, such a synthesis has been impeded by too often quarantining sociological understandings of the literary industry and readerly behaviors from mainstream literary studies under the banner of ‘book history’ or ‘publishing studies’ <sup id="fnref:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup>. Incorporating print-originated  <em>and</em>  born-digital texts into literary studies syllabi, and contextualizing these with studies of the ‘literary system’ would demonstrate how  <em>all</em>  interpretations of a text are influenced by medium and context. Literary works require, in N. Katherine Hayles’s phrasing,  “media-specific analysis”  (<a href="#hayles2004">2004</a>). We cannot hope to understand the ‘digital’ in digital literary culture without borrowing from the conceptual toolbox of media and cultural studies. Work underway and plentifully cited within its own disciplinary settings about media platforms and affordances, interactivity, algorithmic culture, user-generated content, social-media performativity, digital-native research methods, and public humanities outreach complements and illuminates more traditional book historical procedures. The traffic is far from one way either. We can bring to media studies scholars a keener awareness of prior phases of media transition, the long overlaps between media formats, and the resilience, democratisation, and transmedial fluidity of twenty-first-century literary studies — a discipline that cultural studies too readily likes to straw-man as stodgy and elitist.</p>
<h2 id="_how-do-we-talk-about-literature_"><em>How do we talk about literature?</em></h2>
<p>Demotic forms of literary criticism such as cultural journalism, book reviewing, and reading-group discussions have long and rich histories. However, these extra-academic or paraliterary forms of book discussion have too often been belittled or ignored by a literary academy jealously guarding its expertise and needing a ground against which to define itself <sup id="fnref:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup>. This has had the unfortunate effect of long bifurcating professional and amateur readers, alienating broader constituencies with which literary academe might have made common cause. The recent academic rediscovery of affect promises belatedly to legitimize lay readers’ emotional responses to texts within literary studies <sup id="fnref:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup>. This, of course represents a direct challenge to one of the precepts undergirding literary studies’ institutionalization over a century ago: the expunging of subjectivism in interpreting texts. Contemporary academics must engage in the delicate balancing act of recognizing that emotionally-invested modes of reading among book enthusiasts never went away, while simultaneously preserving their own status as professional interpreters of the literary scene. Readerly affect can, as Rita Felski has demonstrated in a trilogy of recent books, itself be the subject of academic analysis for what it reveals about dispositions towards literature (<a href="#felski2008">2008</a>, <a href="#felski2015">2015</a>, <a href="#felski2020">2020</a>). Yet Felski barely mentions the massive archive of  <em>online</em>  readerly evidence (blogs, bookTube reviews, bookstagram posts, and viral TikTok videos) to test whether her inferences about highly-educated academic readers are more broadly verifiable. In engaging with such readerly data, it is equally important not to idealize readerly affect as necessarily resistant, but instead to acknowledge how emotionally authentic reader responses to books are avidly data-mined by media platforms in the interests of fine-tuning their algorithms and driving advertising revenue.</p>
<h2 id="_who-are-literary-studies-contemporary-publics_"><em>Who are literary studies’ contemporary publics?</em></h2>
<p>Related to the above, literary discussion by this point in the twenty-first century must move beyond a narrowing coterie of professional critics to engage meaningfully with broader publics demonstrating interest in literary matters: e.g., books and arts programming in mainstream media; writers’ festival audiences; face-to-face book clubs; book-focused social-cataloguing platforms such as Goodreads; and social-media ‘book talk’ communities. We need to  “build better bridges,”  in Felski’s phrase <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, with these lay readers, long alienated by the abstruse vocabulary and paranoid reading strategies of ideology critique, to cultivate a public humanities mode of literary scholarship. In doing so, we need to guard against any suggestion that we in academe are bringing ‘enlightenment’ to the benighted masses. Such academic rank-pulling seriously misunderstands the flattened hierarchies and interactive norms of online literary culture. Rather, academics need to educate themselves about the protocols governing online literary discussions, attend in good faith to debates already ongoing in digital fora, and grapple with thorny ethical issues of how to research online readerly communities in ways that share research outcomes with the communities studied.</p>
<p>Conversely, and more confronting for the academic ego, what might literary studies  <em>learn</em>  from the affective investments and dialogic practices of non-professional readers, now so abundantly discoverable online? As Carolyn Dinshaw astutely observes,  “amateur literary activities can expose and critique professional literary activities”   <sup id="fnref:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup>. Non-credentialed literary commentators have eagerly embraced the internet’s characteristic distributed architecture and the democratic access it permits. But at the same time, they demonstrate resilient interest in mechanisms for cultural evaluation and discrimination (e.g. cumulative book review ratings, community-endorsed litbloggers, ‘top’ bookTubers etc.). There is no necessary contradiction here: such readerly communities seek a voice in the weighing of literary worth and are restive with literary evaluation taking place behind closed doors and then being handed down, from on high, by an academic clerisy. Rather, they want broadening of the parties to literary discussion and for critics to publicly state their evaluative criteria, with all verdicts being open to debate. Academic expertise still holds value for this group, if academics can trade the familiar role of incontrovertible authority for one of dialogic participant, and can make their arguments in language intelligible to an interested layperson. The success and growth of literary-centric, publicly-oriented websites such as Literary Hub is heartening in this regard.<sup id="fnref:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup>  A niche-targeted content aggregator, it showcases content drawn from academic presses, cultural journalism (print-based and online), and blogsites. Its curatorial tone is well worth emulating: discerning but not exclusionary, smart but fun. Literary Hub’s default inclusion of a comments function beneath each article offers a model for how this new style of literary academe might talk to – and, importantly, with — bookish publics.</p>
<h2 id="_how-best-to-teach-literature_"><em>How best to teach literature?</em></h2>
<p>Digital literary environments’ characteristic textual instability, collaborative authorship, and commercial-creative blurring prompt reappraisal of literary studies’ inherited pedagogical modes. Since the discipline’s institutionalization in the early twentieth century, our pedagogical practices have remained remarkably static: lecture/seminar/tutorial teaching modes; close-reading analytic method; and predominantly one-shot, essay-based assessment <sup id="fnref1:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup>. By contrast, digital technologies enable students to work collectively, for staff to engage students in ongoing scholarly projects, and for established researchers to mentor students’ interventions into popular literary discussion through public-facing assessment outcomes <sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. The dominant pedagogical practice within literary studies can shift from an expert scholar attempting to cultivate like-minded acolytes through a system of apprenticeship, to a facilitator model in which academics provide theoretical and contextual tools for students to reconsider their existing involvement in print and online modes of literary discussion. The aim is to make students conscious of their position within book culture, denaturalizing it as a neutral window onto self-evidently great writing. What if, for example, the end-of-term research essay morphs into a critical examination of Amazon’s terms of service, a series of BookTube videos about the current Booker Prize shortlist, or credited contributions to an evolving DH database? Such alternative modes of assessment need not amount to abrogation of critical rigor for the fashionably flaky, nor exploitation of undergraduate labor for academics’ own career advancement. They simply involve applying literary studies’ critical mindset to a broader array of technological, institutional, economic, social, and cultural mediators than the discipline is accustomed to acknowledge.</p>
<p>The meso-level digital literary studies advocated here is thus not merely a supplementary project of  <em>adding</em>  digital texts to the standard literary studies curriculum: innovation as minimal-effort quick fix. Instead, the digital era necessitates root-and-branch rethinking of the literary studies discipline across multiple domains: object of study; institutional siting (with its implications for theory and method); epistemological aims; envisaged audiences; and pedagogical practice. Thus, for all the claims over the last decade and a half that DH represents a radical attack on traditional literary studies (whether emanating from proponents or opponents), viewed in this light DH hasn’t gone nearly far enough. The same can be said for eLit, to the extent that it still considers itself a separate academic project from DH. Digital technology is not simply a tool for expanding our textual corpora or devising new modes for reading those texts, but an opportunity to recast the whole nature of literary study.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As we enter a third decade of ‘postcritique’ literary studies, it is clear that waiting the digital out is not an option. Conceptions of a print culture posited in steadfast opposition to the digital have been disproven by the consumer trends of the last 25 years and were, in any case, always ontologically suspect. Media historians have long disputed neatly successionist views of a newer communication technology wholesale replacing an earlier medium. The intellectual challenge — and payoff – instead lies in observing different mediums’ patterns of complex interdependence, mutual cannibalization, and unexpected revivification. Literary studies’ post-millennial pivot towards the digital has been welcome in providing our discipline with justification for its continued twenty-first-century relevance. However, the  <em>ways</em>  in which digital literary studies is currently configured have exposed a hollow middle between, at one extreme, micro-scale studies of contemporary born-digital works that are often closer to fine arts practice, are accessed by miniscule publics, and are likely to become technologically obsolete within a decade and, at the other, macro-oriented studies of pre-1923 literary history (now almost a century in the past). Neither of these domains provides a viable roadmap for a literary studies discipline seeking to engage meaningfully with the mainstream of contemporary culture. It is not so much that embrace of the digital has been a mistake for literary studies but that the embrace has been awkwardly set up. Digital technologies not only provide new platforms for existing texts, they normalize new modes for producing texts, radically expand networks for circulating them, and greatly empower readers who seize the opportunity to become textual producers in turn. Digital sociology offers the necessary tools to broaden our analytic gaze to capture this sense of a digital literary sphere in dynamic flux.</p>
<p>To return in closing to the Jim Collins interview mentioned earlier, he speaks of the urgency of the literary academy looking up from its texts and its now-familiar ideological constructions of race, class, gender, and sexuality to engage fully with the  <em>materiality</em>  of contemporary literary culture:  “for me to teach contemporary fiction I should now talk to my students about how they come to it, how it circulates, what’s going on  <em>outside</em>  as well as inside the classroom”   <sup id="fnref:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup>. Such an expansive mindset allows literary academe to converse with communities of paraliterary enthusiasts with whom we have so far had little traffic: the burgeoning and vociferous audiences for writers’ festivals; book clubs; online reviewing; and digitally-hosted book talk in general. Many of these groups have for some decades turned away from academic literary critics as taste arbiters, alienated by the arcane terminology and suspicious reading protocols they encountered in undergraduate curricula or endured in diluted versions as high-schoolers. We cannot afford to pass up this opportunity to make common cause with a sizable body of literary enthusiasts among the broader public, not with literary studies buffeted by falling enrolments, governments’ vocational agenda, and insecure patterns of academic employment. Demotic brands of literary criticism never went away; we just lacked the theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical tools (and yes, perhaps, the willingness) to engage with them. With the advent of the digital literary sphere, these extra-academic literary discussions are better archived, more discoverable, and more socially porous than ever before. We are thus faced with the choice Rita Felski identifies in the epigraph to this article: to retreat in the face of digital culture and to define literariness in ever-more circumscribed and aesthetically exclusive ways. Or, to embrace what the digital literary sphere has to offer our discipline: new things to study; new ways to talk about them; and – crucially – new audiences who may well want to hear what we have to say about how contemporary literary culture actually functions.</p>

<p>Imagine that you are a researcher starting a Ph.D. project or a new book. In addition to identifying a topic, conducting a literature review, and fine-tuning your research question, you will also need to navigate an extensive archive of millions of documents, large parts of which are yet to be cataloged; some collections have been opened to researchers only in recent decades and the digitization of the archive is still at its earliest stages, making a keyword searchable corpus unavailable.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  This situation is the reality of historical research in the Ottoman archives at the time of writing this article. In addition to the challenges of accessibility of the archive, there is also a fundamental question of script literacy; Ottoman Turkish (OT) is written in Arabic script that most Turkish speakers today cannot read. To what scholarly apparatus would historians of differing skill levels turn for doing their work — annotating and transcribing for recall, or simply combing through the most relevant sections of the archive — when these documents are printed in a writing system that is foreign to their contemporary script habitus? It might seem that we are speaking about a many century&rsquo;s old historical situation, but in the case of OT, archival documents created as little as one hundred years ago are not accessible to speakers of modern Turkish who have not received a specialized education in OT.</p>
<p>In Istanbul, where the central archive of the Ottoman State and several of the most important research libraries in the field of Ottoman studies are located, there is an informal market of hireable transcribers to meet the demand for transcription of OT historical documents to Latin script modern Turkish. Consisting mainly of students and graduates of departments of history and Turkish literature, the informal labor of this market offers its services to scholars who do not have the time required to transcribe their documents. In the absence of extensive digitization of archives, these transcribers also provide on-site research services for their individual clients, many of whom do not live, or work regularly, in Istanbul.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>As the digitization of Ottoman-era archives is underway,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  our article concerns one approach to increasing searchable (and computational) access to them. We discuss experiments that we carried out by automatically transcribing a small amount of the holdings of the larger Ottoman archive: two Ottoman Turkish periodical series from the Hakkı Tarık Us (HTU) Digital Repository. With some 1,500 periodicals and an estimated number of 400,000 pages, the HTU online archive is perhaps the most comprehensive digital collection of the Ottoman Turkish press from the 1840s to the 1920s. Originally the private library of Mr. Hakkı Tarık Us (1889-1956), the digitization (2003-2010) of this collection was a collaboration between Beyazıt State Library in Istanbul and Tokyo University of Foreign Studies. Despite being online for a little more than a decade, searchability of the HTU documents is still unavailable.</p>
<p>Whereas some newspaper mass digitization projects in the world were  “launched under circumstances in which searchability was not a priority”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  it is not known to us if this was the case with the HTU corpus or whether OCR-based text creation was simply technically impossible at the time, or both. In the mid- to late-2000s, the HTU platform digitized images in DjVu format — a format that offers a corresponding text layer for each image — the choice of which presumably was to leverage the linguistic skills of literate Ottomanists to transcribe the documents into modern Turkish.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  Unfortunately, this format was already outdated at the time <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Although the file format would have allowed for the creation of a text layer for the HTU as early as 2010, the promise of a text searchable OT corpus remains to this day an unfulfilled one.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>You do not need to be an Ottomanist, of course, to confront such a problem with unsearchable digitized archives; the same could be said of other digital collections in many other world languages: medieval manuscripts, letter collections, miscellanea archives. It is important to note that both digitization and OCR are historical processes with differing degrees of technical development and variable success rates across world languages. In the case of mass digitization of periodicals in the nineteenth century US context, we have been encouraged to  “[take] dirty OCR seriously”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. This is not only because early digitization and OCR methods did not produce high quality text and it is unlikely that either process will be carried out again, but also because no matter what methods of studying imperfect corpora are devised in the future, understanding the layered histories of digitization and text creation remains a key element of digital historical inquiry.</p>
<p>For languages written in Arabic script from right to left, OCR is a complex process in which research has made progress, but is yet to become fully efficient <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  As OCR is an algorithmic process in computer vision that transforms images of letters and words — by many iterations of guessing, ranking, and even human intervention and correction — into digital text, the more intervention that is required the more labor-intensive the process of text creation becomes. Additionally, the more the features of the language that one works with differ from the Latin-based scripts on which OCR was first developed, the more development and research into new systems are required. At the time of writing this article, however, the situation of historical OCR has already started to change radically. This development is mainly thanks to the increased accessibility of user-centered neural systems for transcribing handwritten archives, and by extension for printed cursive scripts, such as Arabic or Ottoman Turkish, in which it can be difficult for a computer to determine where one letter ends and another begins. Some of the current generation neural systems’ text recognition abilities go beyond simple character recognition, which has been the main challenge OCR faces with handwritten texts and cursive scripts such as Arabic — due to the fact that some letters are connected to each other — to allow for larger chunks of the text, such as words or whole lines, to be recognized as units. In this paper, we adopt one such system for automating the transcription of printed OT texts, the platform known as <a href="https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/">Transkribus</a>, and we argue that not only are new approaches to OCR beneficial in opening up historical archives, but also that with those approaches comes an evolving role for human effort and new, concomitant challenges for working with such machine-created text.</p>
<p>Our choice to apply handwritten text recognition (HTR) technologies to non-Latin script digitized historical periodicals is an intentional one, with the purpose of creating a workable access point to Ottoman historical materials. The long term goal of our research is to generate general HTR models for text creation from this periodicals collection that will facilitate its use in computational research. In this article we discuss some of the initial challenges we have faced, as well as some of the promising results that we have achieved.</p>
<p>As interest turns to a multilingual DH, the accessibility of archives and modes of participatory text creation, we find the Ottoman Turkish example to be a thought-provoking case study since it links problems which the GLAM sector has traditionally confronted with other problems not typically found in Western language archives: text directionality and script, in particular.</p>
<h2 id="part-1---background--historical-context">Part 1 - Background &amp; Historical Context</h2>
<h2 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h2>
<p>How we encode Ottoman Turkish (OT), the Arabic-script language of administration and high culture in the Ottoman Empire between the fourteenth and early twentieth centuries, presents a significant challenge for OCR, not only from a computer vision perspective, but also importantly from a linguistic one.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  While Turkish syntax and vocabulary formed the main framework of the language, OT borrowed extensively from Arabic and Farsi in terms of both loan words and grammatical structures. With the political upheaval that ensued the demise of the Ottoman state and the creation of the Turkish Republic in the wake of WWI, OT was outlawed for public use in 1928 and supplanted by a Turkified<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  version of the language written from left to right (LTR) in Latin script <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It would be incorrect to say, however, that the Ottoman archive was sealed in 1928. Physical access to it was possible, although limited <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, but within a generation or so, the Arabic-script literacy required to use the archives declined. The first generation of historians who had been educated in Republican schools no longer had the linguistic skills of native speakers of OT to carry out research in the archives. Coupled with the ideological choice of the political leadership to shun the Islamic imperial heritage of the newly created nation-state of Turkey, the so-called Turkish language reform created deep gaps in the scholarly infrastructure of the early Republican period, with most serious academic discussions on Ottoman history and language shifting to scholarly circles outside of Turkey.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Alphabet change had deeper cultural implications that went well beyond its ramifications for the scholarly establishment. Today, any Turkish citizen who wants to access their pre-1928 cultural heritage needs either to receive specialized education in Ottoman Turkish or to read the transcribed and edited versions of the select OT texts available in modern Turkish. Reading OT documents and books transcribed into Latin script has become the norm. There is, therefore, a real demand for transcription, a demand that, to this day, has been only partially satisfied by human transcription.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  Furthermore, the language reform has not only created a barrier between one nation and its historical, cultural documentation but also, as OT was the former administrative language of the successor states of the Ottoman Empire, both language and script persist as barriers in accessing this larger imperial heritage by the broader scholarly community.</p>

<p>For many languages of the world that have not traditionally been represented in the textual digital humanities, in particular historical languages, the obstacles of being at the table are very real.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  Research materials and infrastructure for these languages are absent or in outdated formats, digitization is either partial or piecemeal, and accessing those digital resources can be a daunting task.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  In the larger case of Ottoman Turkish, there is a lack not only of sufficient machine-readable corpora but also of natural language processing (NLP) tools designed to work with the multi-layered, multi-epoch complexities of this historical language.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  When the archive is so abundant, yet still so inaccessible, the eagerness to open up research fields to exploration with digital methods grows every year.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
<p>We believe that pursuing digital methods in some non-Latin script research fields, such as Ottoman studies, is not so much a question of resistance to, or distrust of, the methods as it is of the need for workable starting points, given the historical and linguistic complexity of these languages.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  Furthermore, the desire for high-quality text creation at scale can stand at odds with the capacity and affordances of the platforms at our disposal to do so. Deferring the question of what kind of corpus might be representative of late Ottoman society for now, and building on the decades-long efforts to create open digital collections for reuse and high order analysis, what has come to be known as a  “collections as data”  approach <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, we turn to automatic transcription of printed Ottoman periodicals with the  <em>Transkribus</em>  platform using deep learning methods. Whereas traditional Ottomanist communities have relied on workarounds for research that depend on informal labor for gaining access to archival materials, our case study argues that technical workarounds within developing humanities research infrastructure can, and do, spark innovation in the interest of linguistic inclusion.</p>
<h2 id="new-modes-of-text-creation">New Modes of Text Creation</h2>
<p>At the intersection of archives and the textual digital humanities is the central question of access. Initiatives such as the EEBO-Text Creation Partnership have opened exciting windows for a wide range of scholarly projects grounded in access to historical print sources <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Its presence can be felt all over the scholarship in pre-modern English, and yet its mode of creation — outsourced double typing of texts in Asian countries — casts an uncomfortable, but often overlooked, shadow over the material conditions of its creation. Scholarly communities working on languages printed in the Arabic script (Arabic, Persian, Urdu, etc.) have been slower to arrive at robust textual digital humanities for multiple reasons, not the least of which has been the difficulties of converting the cursive-like printing of these languages into a machine-readable format <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. We anticipate that examples in crowd-transcription, such as Transcribe Bentham (UCL), or more recent initiatives spearheaded within the GLAM sector (Library of Congress, Europeana, the Newberry Library, the Getty Museum, Zooinverse), and the democratized platforms for engaging a larger public in doing so, will slowly make their way to cultural heritage institutions in societies using RTL (right to left) scripts. What can be done in situations, however, such as OT, when the script of the archive is no longer native for the majority of the public? Our challenge has been not only that of automatic transcription but also rendering the output of this process sufficiently legible for the LTR (left to right) Turkish reader today</p>
<p>Whereas some formal modeling has been done with OT (take for example, the markup of multilingual versions of the Ottoman Constitution in TEI XML including OT and Arabic versions <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, our intervention focuses at a more rudimentary stage of new text creation; it is ground research that aims to produce someone of the first, if not the first, searchable text corpus of OT. While this situation might be surprising to digital humanists working in European, or even large non-Western languages, for whom the existence of some kind of corpus has been a given for many decades, the lack of basic keyword searchability is the reality of text-based research in Ottoman studies.</p>
<p>One key technological development that opened a promising pathway for the creation of full-text searchable corpora for both printed and handwritten documents in Arabic script is the recent advances in pattern recognition with HTR. Unlike many OCR systems, which operate at the level of individual characters, HTR works at line level and, as a result, yields higher accuracy rates in recognizing cursive scripts such as Arabic.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  Taking advantage of this particular characteristic of the HTR technology, we have carried out our automated transcription experiments for printed OT periodicals with HTR. The larger question of the full Ottoman archive, most of which is manuscript, however, still sits in the background of this article. Turn of the century printed materials in Ottoman Turkish (or in Arabic or Urdu, for matter), do exist on a continuum with handwritten materials, due to the fact that they are printed in a cursive-like manner. It is too simplistic, therefore, to oppose print and manuscript cultures in OT, especially because Ottoman master printers did, in fact,strive to reproduce the calligraphic traditions of the manuscript culture in the printed page <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="why-periodicals">Why Periodicals</h2>
<p>After decades of digitization efforts in libraries and archives worldwide, the number of periodicals that are available to today’s researchers has increased dramatically. For the historian, the serial periodical offers special insight into cultural debates as they unfold throughout time. Nineteenth-century periodicals are the place of remarkable emergence of public discourse in many regions of the world, including the multi-ethnic and multi-religious Ottoman Empire.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  They also provide a valuable opportunity to reconsider this cultural sphere in a period marked by rapidly evolving linguistic usage in the face of political change <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Significant advances have been made globally in the accessibility of cultural collections through digitization and the implementation of full-text searchability and vibrant debates have opened up in digital history on how to use this digitized archive to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>There are a number of features of historical periodicals that make them complex for digital analysis in any language: OCR quality, the commercial nature of digitization collections, complex page layouts, the presence of images within the text, and particularities of their digital remediation <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. Yet again, the challenge of dealing with Arabic-script periodicals is an even greater one. Whereas many periodicals have been scanned and brought together in digital archives in these languages, allowing researchers to access them at a distance, the texts of such periodicals are still messy and not full text searchable, limiting users to slow reading and requiring computer-assisted modes of analysis to adapt to the text quality.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  Unsurprisingly, the few studies that have used various Ottoman periodicals collections as their main primary source have so far been qualitative and of limited scope <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. The sheer volume of the available material, as well as the outdated formats and piecemeal nature of their digitization, renders distant reading of these sources unfeasible. These collections are not yet data.</p>
<h2 id="part-2---transcription-and-its-discontents">Part 2 - Transcription and Its Discontents</h2>
<h2 id="audience--a-pragmatic-approach">Audience &amp; A Pragmatic Approach</h2>
<p>Mastering OT today is a demanding task. People who undertake learning the language/script nowadays do so in order to read historical manuscripts and documents. Among those who are proficient in OT, it is not common practice to take notes in Arabic script, but rather in what is the contemporary script habitus of Turkish historians as well as that of the majority of non-Turkish Ottomanists: the LTR Latin alphabet <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>; researchers in the field simply tend to annotate their documents in Latin script. Owing to script differences and language change, annotation style can vary from person to person, with some researchers even transcribing their documents fully into modern Turkish. Furthermore, in Turkey, editions of OT works are rarely published in Arabic script, or if they are, they are accompanied by a facing-page transcription. As such, the OT script in contemporary Turkey could be considered a dead script. Being able to automate the transcription of OT to Latin writing system of modern Turkish, therefore, is also a question of creating a knowledge infrastructure that corresponds to a practical issue of contemporary script literacy.</p>
<p>The usage of terms for discussing the passages between languages and scripts, from OT to MT, have varied significantly. Our <a href="#appendix">Appendix (Key Concepts)</a> details how we use the terms transliteration, transcription and romanization. These three terms all imply some kind of passage between writing systems and they require careful consideration if we are to adopt a critical approach to text creation of OT printed material. We have come to realize that our approach to automated transcription with deep learning methods needs to be a pragmatic one that balances a number of concerns, such as paying enough attention to the requirements of the HTR engine so that the model is effective while also being consistent enough so that the digital reuse of the resultant data is the highest quality possible, at the same time keeping in mind the needs of the human reader. We are aware that, due to the particularities of OT, which we discuss in the following section about the encoding of grammatical information, it will probably never be possible to build an automated transcription system that flawlessly bridges the gap between the original OT documents and their transcriptions. Our goal in applying neural models of automated transcription to OT printed materials is, instead, the creation of a decent text, a workable, good-enough approach to transcription, a goal echoed by other historians working in digitally under-resourced languages <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>.</p>
<p>No doubt this will be disappointing to our philologically inclined colleagues, but it is the scale and the modes of downstream analysis that encourage us to adopt this position. We do not see the text creation process as a failure from the outset. Instead, working with automatic transcription has encouraged us to think about the transcription process itself as an initial access point to the historical materials. Our goal is to produce a result that is sufficiently accurate and usable by our target reader (the historian scholar engaged in professional reading), and we recognize that the end result will never look fully like human-transcribed texts <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. From this starting point, it follows that what is necessary to use HTR methods to bring new kinds of access to a larger number of OT texts is a critical conversation about what is commonly called transcription.</p>
<p>We are particularly drawn to the idea of crowd transcription among Turkish speakers that could transform the existing informal economy of OT transcribers into a participatory community of shareable, open knowledge production. This will not be possible, however, without a larger scholarly debate about transcription and transliteration that departs from contemporary practices of inconsistent romanization in favor of one that is more harmonized with the ways that algorithmic systems work. Pilot studies such as ours with automated transcription technologies are in a position to launch this debate. The question resembles one that is asked regularly in human-computer interaction research: how do we design interfaces and input mechanisms for human knowledge so that we can optimize the results of computational processes? The answers to such questions can only emerge, we believe, through the development of a user community that tests, evaluates, and validates such transcription norms in different textual domains.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-of-transcribing-ot-and-its-implications-for-htr-processing">Challenges of Transcribing OT and Its Implications for HTR Processing</h2>
<p>Ottoman Turkish, in its classical form, is a patchwork of Turkish, Arabic, and Farsi vocabulary and grammar. The complexity of the language is compounded by the challenges of the romanization of Arabic script in which OT was written <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Elezar Birnbaum summarizes the complex character of OT orthography as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Ottoman Turkish writing system is only an  <em>indication</em>  of pronunciation rather than a representation of it. It incorporates two quite different methods of indicating sounds, which are ill-joined into one system&hellip; On the one hand, Arabic and Persian spelling conventions are preserved almost intact for all Ottoman words derived from those languages, while completely different conventions, rarely explicitly formulated and still more rarely consistently applied, even in a single piece of writing, hold the field for words of Turkish and other origins, and for Turkish affixes to Arabic and Persian loan words.<br>
<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the complicated nature of OT orthography, where several sounds in the language are omitted in writing and the correct pronunciation of a word is contingent upon the reader’s literacy and linguistic background, Modern Turkish (MT) spelling is unequivocal and highly phonetic. This crucial difference between the two writing systems renders a one-to-one, diplomatic transliteration scheme from OT to MT unattainable.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  This situation also partially accounts for the fact that to this day there is no scholarly consensus on how to, if at all, transcribe OT to MT.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  However, if we remember the anecdote with which we began this article about the informal labor market of transcribers, despite the lack of a transcription scheme based on consensus,<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>  OT text transcribed to MT is often preferred over original material as a matter of practicality.</p>
<p>To further break down the factors that hamper character-accurate, diplomatic transcription from OT script to MT: There are only three vowel signs in Arabic ( ا, و , ى ) , which are often not represented but only implied in writing. MT, on the other hand, has eight vowels and the written word is always fully vocalized. Moreover, letters ( ا, و , ى ) are polyphonic, i.e., they correspond to more than one sound in MT script. For example, Arabic letter (و ) may correspond to any of the following characters in MT: ( v, o , ö, u , ü ). Several of the OT consonants are polyphonic as well. Depending on the textual context, they may be substituted by several different letters in the MT alphabet (Table 1).<br>
Character correspondence chart of polyphonic OT letters    Ottoman Turkish  Modern Turkish      ا  a, e      ض  d, z      ك  k, g, ğ, n      و  v, o, u, ő,      ە  h, e, a      ى  y, a, ı, i   <br>
Finally, the phonological developments of Turkish language over the centuries and the wide variation in its pronunciation across the vast geography of the Ottoman Empire as well as across its socio-economic and ethnic groups at any given point in time, created a gap between its written and spoken forms. This means that many OT words may be pronounced in and transcribed to modern Turkish in several different forms, all of which might be considered accurate. Any endeavor to produce a “correct” transcription of OT in MT script is, in reality, an attempt to recreate what we imagine was the pronunciation of the Istanbul elite at the time, which, of course, is lost to us in its spoken form <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the key steps in HTR is the creation of ground truth transcriptions corresponding to segmented parts of the digitized image. Therefore, the above three points have important practical implications for how we carry out transcriptions. As an Ottoman Turkish text is transcribed into Latin script, linguistic information is added to its romanized version by way of vocalizing it and rendering it in one of its several alternative pronunciations, which might not necessarily correspond to the written form. The presence of polyphonic letters necessitates another layer of choices to be made by the transcriber. It is not unreasonable to regard the reading and transcribing of OT as an art rather than a science, a quality that does match the exigencies of the current generation of computational tools, including HTR. The unavoidable addition of linguistic information to the transcribed material is especially problematic when training a neural-network based transcription system such as Transkribus, where one-to-one correspondence between the original text and its transcription is essential. It also results in the introduction of a significant degree of bias to the language data that is provided by the transcriber for the neural network. We will discuss these issues in more detail in Part 3.</p>
<h2 id="previous-work-on-the-automated-transcription-of-ot">Previous Work on the Automated Transcription of OT</h2>
<p>There are currently two other projects that focus on the automated transcription of Ottoman Turkish <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Both are similar in methodology and scope, employing morphological analysis and lexicon-based approaches to romanize OT script. Korkut and Ergiş et al.&rsquo;s studies take advantage of the fact that Turkish is an agglutinative language, and that the stems of Turkish words do not inflect when combined with affixes. Once an OT word is stripped of its affixes through morphological parsing, the stem can be looked up in a dictionary for possible matches in modern Turkish.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>  At the next step, these two romanization models reconstruct the stripped affixes in modern Turkish according to its spelling and pronunciation rules and offer potential transcriptions for the original OT word in Latin script. Both projects work with nineteenth and early twentieth century OT vocabulary, presumably because dictionaries with relatively extensive content are more readily available for this period than for previous centuries.</p>
<p>An important distinction between these romanization schemes and our approach using Transkribus is their rule-based approach to automated transcription. Their systems depend on conventional linguistic knowledge (dictionaries and grammatical rules) whereas the HTR offers a statistical, brute force technique that utilizes large data sets for pattern recognition without any explicit reliance on linguistic information. While rule-based approaches might conceivably produce a higher precision output, Korkut and Ergişi et al.’s methods still have important shortcomings. In the absence of a rigorous OCR system for OT, it is not feasible to transcribe longer texts in their interfaces. They can also only romanize those words that are already in their databases. The scalability of these platforms depends on the creation of comprehensive OT to MT word-databases/dictionaries, which need to be significantly more substantial in content than anything that is currently available,<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  and the development of effective OCR systems for the Arabic script to convert OT texts to machine-readable format. Even if these two conditions are met, however, the automated transcription of large corpora in these platforms might still be prohibitively slow due to the time needed for dictionary searches to match the OT stems to their MT counterparts.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="htr-for-automated-transcription">HTR for Automated Transcription</h2>
<p>In principle, an HTR engine can be taught to recognize any writing style from any language. To start, the system needs to be provided with training data to identify the specific patterns in a given body of text. In order to produce a reliable transcription model for the rest of the corpus, it is imperative to create an accurate ground truth, a literal and exact transcription of a small body of sample text, that is representative of the corpus in question.</p>
<p>While the absence of linguistic rules<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>  in HTR training does create certain shortcomings in the quality of the transcription, we prefer the approach for its practicality, time-efficiency, and scalability. HTR has proven to be most effective with large corpora and after the initial investment of time for creating the ground truth, it is possible to automatically transcribe hundreds of pages within a matter of hours. The system is also flexible and accepts changes in parameters. That is, with a large and diverse enough training set,<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>  it is possible to generate general HTR models that will work for corpora produced with different handwriting styles or typefaces.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  However, it is also important to highlight here that what the creation of general models entail is not yet well defined within the Transkribus environment. What combination of materials or which order or re-training would produce best results appears to depend on the size and the nature of the corpora and requires, at the moment, a trial and error approach.</p>
<p>One advantage of using HTR for OT is its relatively higher accuracy rate at segmenting and recognizing cursive and connected writing styles. Unlike most OCR based systems, which operate at letter level (for both segmentation and recognition) and are, therefore, not very efficient for connected scripts such as Arabic, HTR works at line level and recognizes characters in the context of words and lines rather than as individual units.</p>
<p>This renders it an excellent tool for languages written with the Arabic alphabet.</p>
<h2 id="part-3---our-experiment">Part 3 - Our Experiment</h2>
<h2 id="the-procedure">The Procedure</h2>
<p>The  <em>Transkribus</em>  platform produces automated transcriptions of text collections by using customized HTR models trained on partial transcriptions of the corpus. As we have argued at the beginning of Part 2, tools are often not a perfect fit for the historical source material we possess and the results we obtain teach us a significant amount about our objects of study. In this study, after significant trial and error, we ultimately reverse engineered our research workflow to address critical questions of both the object of study (the periodicals and their language) and the method itself.</p>
<p>We created two sets of training data and corresponding HTR models for two periodicals<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  from the HTU online collection, the above-mentioned digitized collection of OT periodicals. The first one of these publications is the  <em>Ahali</em>  newspaper, printed in Bulgaria between 1906 and 1907. For this publication, we adhered to a loose transcription<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  scheme that only indicates long OT vowels and does not use any other diacritical marks. The second periodical for which we generated a training set is  <em>Küçük Mecmua</em> , published by the leading ideologue of Turkism at the time, Ziya Gökalp, between 1922 and 1923 in Diyarbakir, Turkey. This publication has a significantly Turkified vocabulary and a relatively standardized orthography compared to other OT publications. We applied the  <em>Islam Ansiklopedisi</em>  (IA) transcription scheme<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>  for  <em>Küçük Mecmua</em> , which uses diacritical marks to differentiate between polyphonic characters in the OT and MT alphabets. Our assumption was that the regularized orthography and the detailed transcription system might help to reduce ambiguity in the transcription text for this publication, providing us with a cleaner starting point for the HTR.</p>
<p>The HTR neural network employed learns to recognize a script by matching the characters, strings or groups of words in the image files with their counterparts in the transcription. Adhering to a diplomatic transcription scheme, therefore, is recommended for creating reliable HTR models. This basic principle complicates the workflow for OT in  <em>Transkribus</em>  significantly for two reasons; first, as we mentioned above, the lack of one-to-one mapping between OT and MT scripts, and second, the opposite directionality of Ottoman Turkish documents and their Latin script transcriptions.</p>
<p>To address the first issue and minimize the inconsistencies in the training data, in our transcriptions we prioritized character accuracy over both the correct pronunciation of the OT words and some of the grammatical rules of modern Turkish.<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>  We also opted for maintaining spelling mistakes and typos in the transcription text exactly as they appeared in the original pages, rather than correcting them. In other words, although these decisions seem counterintuitive to the experienced transcriber, working with an HTR system for a RTL historical language required us to unlearn some of the conventions of our practical research habits for the purposes of transcription for creating training data. By avoiding usual scholarly practices of transcription and giving the algorithm what it needs to do its task, we hoped to optimize its performance.</p>
<p>The first step of the HTR workflow involved transferring the images of the documents into the platform, followed by the automated segmentation and layout analysis for the recognition of text regions and baselines in these documents.</p>
<p>The opposing directionalities of OT and MT come into play at the next step of the workflow, in which images of the documents are linked to corresponding transcriptions. While the  <em>Transkribus</em>  platform does support RTL languages, it does not allow connecting RTL images to LTR transcription text. To bypass this problem, we devised a workaround and reversed the direction of our transcription text in modern Turkish from LTR to RTL (<a href="#figure01">Fig 1</a>).<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>  To this end, we wrote a short script in Python and ran it for the plain text files of our transcriptions.<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup></p>

<p>After the careful preparation of the two sets of ground truth, sixty pages each, we generated our first HTR models for  <em>Ahali</em>  and  <em>Küçük Mecmua</em> , yielding 9.84% and 9.69% Character Error Rates (CER) respectively. In the second phase of the process, we retrained the models by manually correcting errors in the automated transcription and expanding each set of ground truth by an additional twenty pages. We also used our initial HTR models as base models in the second round of training. The manual correction of the automated transcription output, the expansion of the training set by twenty pages, and the use of base models to boost the accuracy rate of the later models have dropped the CER for  <em>Ahali</em>  newspaper to 5.15 % and for  <em>Küçük Mecmua</em>  to 7.86%. (Table 1) As it is clear from these numbers, the IA transcription scheme did not provide an advantage over the less detailed transcription system in terms of CER. This might, however, be due to the relatively modest size of the training data and a larger sample set might offer a better comparison amongst the various transcription models.</p>
<p>Finally, for text analysis purposes or human reading, the automatically transcribed texts are exported from the platform and their directionality is reversed to LTR.<br>

<p>The  <em>Transkribus</em>  platform allows the repurposing of HTR models to re-train the neural network for recognizing different corpora as well as community sharing of those models. In future work, we hope to take advantage of this function to develop general HTR model(s) and evaluate to what extent they might work for the entirety of the HTU digital repository. To this end, we will focus on creating additional training sets from the holdings of this digital collection.</p>
<p>For the HTR technology we have at our disposal, the HTU collection of late Ottoman periodicals is an ideal corpus. By the late 1870s the typeface for printing had been standardized and a set of printing conventions for OT periodicals established.<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  Furthermore, the OT press from this period tended to cover similar topics and promote comparable agendas; as a result, they contain similar vocabulary, terminology, and named entities. All of these factors, along with the possibility of using a language model function,<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>  contribute to the reduction of error rate in text recognition. It is this uniformity of this printed corpus that, we hope, will allow the HTR model to generalize across the entire HTU corpus with acceptable accuracy. It should be said though that for scholars in the field who intend to expand HTR to manuscript archives, finding a comparable corpus uniformity will no doubt be a challenge.</p>
<p>To test how the HTR model would function across different textual domains, we ran the  <em>Ahali</em>  HTR model for three other periodicals from the HTU collection. Attention was paid to include in the sample pool publications from different time periods with distinct content and agendas. The CER for random pages from these periodicals are as follows (Table 2):<br>
The newspapers used in the cross-domain applicability experiment       <strong>Name of Publication</strong>        <strong>Subject</strong>        <strong>Date of Publication</strong>        <strong>CER</strong>            <em>Tasvir-i Efkar</em>     politics  1863  8.54%         <em>Mekteb</em>     education and literature  1891  10.26%         <em>Kadınlar Dünyası</em>     feminism  1914  6.22%   <br>
It is important to note here that the CERs listed above were attained without any training data from these publications or any correction and retraining of the model. This is an encouraging indication suggesting that with the expansion of our ground truth, it is, in fact, achievable to create viable general HTR model(s) for the entire online collection of the HTU library.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-of-the-results">Discussion of the Results</h2>
<p>The primary challenge HTR faces when working with OT seems to be not character recognition, but rather identifying OT words in their proper Modern Turkish (MT) forms. As discussed earlier, the absence of one-to-one correspondence between OT and MT alphabets leads to multiple possible transcription outputs. Even when the HTR correctly identifies the characters in an OT word, accurate reading still depends on precise vocalization as well as context-appropriate pronunciation of the polyphonic letters. These, in turn, necessitate prior linguistic information, which is not taken into account during HTR training. In other words, no deep learning tool would be able to complete the desired task of a flawless MT transcription.</p>
<p>The recently implemented Language Models (LM)<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>  function in  <em>Transkribus</em>  appears to partially compensate for the absence of rule-based text recognition in the platform. When supported with LM, HTR renders Ottoman Turkish words in their context-accurate form as they are defined in the training data. This, in turn, reduces Character and Word Error Rates.<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>  For example, the OT word (عمله), which appears in our training set for the  <em>Kucuk Mecmua</em>  periodical, has two possible readings, both of which are character-accurate, imle and amele whereas only the latter is a meaningful word unit in OT, the equivalent of the English word worker. In our experiment, text recognition without Language Model transcribed the word as imle. When we ran the HTR with the LM, however, the word was correctly recognized as amele, the version that was defined in the training data. In addition, the LM appears to be able to identify character sequences that are not in the training data and even  “assign a high probability to an inflected form without ever seeing it.”   <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>. This contributes to the accurate transcription of words that are not in the training set. While this is far from being the perfect solution for working around the ambiguities of OT, and a significant departure from rule-based NLP systems, it is still a step towards HTR-created, human-readable text.</p>
<p>Moreover, the neural network appears to be able to easily detect oft-repeated words and word pairs (such as Farsi possessive constructions, which are particularly challenging to identify in OT texts), presumably as a result of line-level operations of HTR. Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that the system will produce higher accuracy rates for document collections with formulaic language or corpora dealing with similar subjects and vocabulary. It is tempting to imagine a future of not only language-blind HTR, but also one that is language agnostic, or even multilingual adaptive, that can learn the particular linguistic strata or multilingual usage in a given corpus. It is still important to underline, however, that a more comprehensive solution to the problem of multiple possible outputs in OT transcription might be the integration of dictionaries/word indices into the system.<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  In the absence of such an option, the best alternative would seem to be providing the HTR and LM with a larger sample of language data to account for a greater degree of orthographical variance.</p>
<p>Stemming from our experience with generating HTR models for different publications, we infer that the best approach to extensive collections, such as HTU, is to create date/period specific HTR models for subsets of those corpora. The late nineteenth century was a time of accelerated linguistic development and experimentation for Ottoman Turkish, both in its spoken and written forms. Therefore, temporal (and/or genre) proximity of publications in sub-groups is likely to contribute to the creation of more accurate HTR models. This would, presumably, also be the most practical approach to the automated transcription of the Ottoman manuscript archive, which is considerably more sizable than the print documents and publications in this language.</p>
<p>Finally, our experiment with HTR for OT print material affirmed the widely accepted conceptualization of transcription as a biased process and that machine facilitated transcription is no exception to this. Both HTR and LM rely on the language data provided by the transcriber; they, in turn, reproduce the transcriber’s linguistic bias in the output. As aptly described by Alpert-Abrams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The machine-recognition of printed characters is a historically charged event, in which the system and its data conspire to embed cultural biases in the output, or to affix them as supplementary information hidden behind the screen.<br>
<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup> In the case of the automated transcription of OT, the imposition of a uniform transcription scheme on the language obscures regional, temporal, and ethnic varieties in its pronunciations and creates an artificially homogeneous outlook for OT which does not reflect the historical reality of the language. For our project with OT periodicals, however, this point is less of a concern because these publications tended to, indeed, adhere to the standards of high Ottoman, that is, to an OT spoken and written by the educated elites of the Empire. Still, the language information we, as the users of the automated transcription platform, impose on the neural network does not only affect the quality and readability of the output but also has important downstream implications from keyword searches and Named Entity tagging to other NLP applications to OT corpora. Corpora creation has for a long time been viewed as a complex political process, and with deep learning and computationally intensive models, this is no less the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In our paper we have discussed ongoing research into text creation via automatic transcription in order to bring OT into dialogue with analytical modes of the textual digital humanities. The limited development and application of OCR methods compatible with Arabic script languages has no doubt been one of the rate determining steps, not only in the development of textual corpora, but also in the attendant language technologies that support the use of such corpora. To wish — in 2022 — for basic keyword search capacity within digitized media of the nineteenth and early twentieth century might seem to some as a rather old fashioned request, and yet for Ottomanists, it is an actual one. Limited access to digitized versions of the archive, a lack of language- and script-specific OCR in addition to a lack of scholarly infrastructure in the OT situation have meant that scholars have been slow to adopt digital methods.</p>
<p>The landscape of Arabic script languages is changing rapidly, especially with neural automatic transcription systems, as they can accommodate cursive-like scripts and typefaces. In order for these systems to perform well, however, they will require training on many more domains and spatio-temporal variants of the language and handwriting styles. In the case of printed materials, training on different typefaces and printing conventions will also be necessary.</p>
<p>A move to new transcription methods for OT will not mean the total automatization of the transcription process, removing it from scholarly labor; instead it will require a reorganization of those efforts from informal to somewhat organized one. We do not expect that people will stop transcribing small amounts by hand for specific purposes, but we do suspect that it will change the way that large text creation projects work, as well as how archives create finding aids as digitized material becomes available.</p>
<p>In the specific case of printed periodicals in OT, in order to achieve the goal of enabling keyword searching and more complex forms of modeling and analysis of OT textual content via HTR produced text, a multi-pronged approach will be required. First, a team-based approach to transcription for the purposes of the creation of ground truth will be required (or even some crowdsourced, community-based approaches that have yet to be defined). Such a community effort might be achieved by sharing the model generated for the HTU print collection publicly, although how the endeavor would scale remains to be seen. Second, even though the platform-as-service model of the READ COOP may provide scholars with a variety of public models, the computing resources that allow these to run might exclude scholars and archives without the resources to buy in. It may be that only open models provide a more sustainable solution. Third, research is needed not only to recognize the Arabic script that is used in the specific genre discussed in this article — periodicals — but also, as in many other language situations, for structure recognition and image extraction that would allow for formal modeling of the resultant periodicals as research objects.</p>
<p>We are not experts in the histories of all writing systems, but we believe our results may be applied to other language situations that have changed, or have used multiple, scripts over time: Aljamiado, Azeri, Bosnian, Crimean, Judeo-Spanish, Malay and Wolof, just to name a few. Our research with automatic transcription of periodicals printed in the Ottoman Empire during the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century has important implications for multi-script archives of nation-states located in the borderlands of empires and religions. After all, language reforms forged new modernized versions of languages such as Hebrew and Arabic while maintaining their original scripts, but in other places writing systems were changed altogether. As we described in depth above, in Turkey the Arabic script of OT was abandoned in favor of a modified Latin alphabet. The political disintegration of states at other moments of the twentieth century, in particular the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, led to fragmentation of similar languages into script-divergent varieties that both straddle current political borders and co-exist with older variance found in archives. If script change comes about in moments of radical political change enacting ruptures in archives, it also seems to map onto a slow globalizing of the Latin script — and not without significant political debate — in different countries around the world around the turn of the twenty-first century. Turkmenistan adopted a Latin alphabet in the late 1990s as well as Kazakhstan as recently as 2017. This geopolitical context raises the question of what will become of digitized archives in such locales — printed and handwritten — and adds totally new contours to the notion of the great unread in nations already cut off from the scripts of their past, as well as those that may be facing a phasing out of old alphabets. Future developments in digitization and text creation from borderland archives — if they are to happen — need to take into account not only the automatic transcription of written language, but also the various writing systems in which those languages will be expressed.</p>
<h2 id="key-concepts-transcription-transliteration-romanization">Key Concepts: Transcription, Transliteration, Romanization</h2>
<p>There are a number of terms that are intrinsically related, and some of which we use interchangeably in this paper, that are central to our automated recognition of OT project.</p>
<p>Transliteration is the substitution of the characters of a script by those of another alphabet. In an ideal transliteration, each character of the source script will be represented with only one and always the same symbol in the target writing system, creating a one-to-one mapping, or graphemic correspondence, between scripts.</p>
<p>Transcription, on the other hand, is the representation of the sounds of an alphabet with the characters of another script. A transcription attempts to offer an accurate phonetic rendering of the source language even when this violates the graphemic correspondence between scripts. This means that, depending on the textual context, a polyphonic character- a letter that represents more than one sounds- may be substituted by several different letters in the target alphabet. In some cases, the reverse might be true. In the instance of OT transcription to modern Turkish, transcription also involves representing sounds, vowels to be more specific, which are only implied but are not written in the original text. Precisely because of this, the transliteration of OT inevitably becomes transcription.</p>
<p>A popular, or loose, transcription, is an approximation of the conventional orthography and popular pronunciation of a word in a different script. It will produce a transcription that is easy to follow by contemporary audiences while inevitably forgoing important linguistic information in the original text.</p>
<p>Finally, romanization is the substitution of the characters of a non-Roman script by those of the Roman alphabet <sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In a 1960 article, Stanford Show, a leading scholar of Ottoman history, described the challenges of working in Ottoman archives as follows:  “Months of searching into the catalogs is necessary to locate all available materials concerning each subject, and much longer time is required to gather these materials and mold them into an intelligible unit of study”   <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>.

<p>Such was the experience of one of the authors of this article, a native speaker of Turkish, while conducting her doctoral research on the emergence of a modern public education network for women in the Ottoman Empire. The examination of the undigitized and uncataloged documents of the Ottoman Ministry of Public Education and the relevant Ottoman Turkish periodicals took over a year. She enlisted the help of a transcriber to annotate and transcribe the documents she collected. The hired transcriber also conducted research in the Hakkı Tarık Us Periodicals Collection, which, at the time, had not yet been fully digitized.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>In the context of debates surrounding a canonical seventeenth century OT text, H.E.

The position we take in this study, which is arguably the commonly accepted practice today, is formulated by Robert Anhegger as a response to Boeschton:  “The guiding principle should be to produce a transcription which is as easy as possible to follow”   <sup id="fnref1:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:42" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Currently, there are four transcriptions schemes widely used in scholarly publications: Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft (DMG) system, Encyclopaedia of Islam (EI, 2nd edition) system, International Journal of Middle Eastern Studies (IJMES) system, and and Islam Ansiklopedisi (IA) system. For a comparative chart of these transcription systems, see <a href="#bugday2014">Bugday (2014)</a>. Turkish scholars tend to prefer the IA system. Modern Turkish versions of OT texts that are produced for the general population, on the other hand, often do not adhere to a strict system but rather follow a loose transcription. As a case in point, the Turkish Historical Society — a government agency for the study and promotion of Turkish history — endorses a loose rather than scientific transcription of post-1830s printed works. For archival material from the same period, however, they recommend scientific transcription, a term they use interchangeably with transliteration.

<p>Transkribus does allow integrating custom prepared dictionaries into HTR training, but at present the computational cost is too high to justify the miniscule improvement in the accuracy rate of the automated transcription. Based on a correspondence with the Transkribus team, however, we understand that there has been a recent improvement in the recognition-with-dictionary workflow which speeds up the process. In expectation of further developments in this vein, we have started compiling a comprehensive digital Ottoman Turkish dictionary based on Ferit Devellioğlu’s seminal work <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>.

<p>As a case in point, the number of general HTR models made available to the public in the Transkribus interface have increased significantly over the last year, expanding not only the language, but the domain and genre applicability of the method. For example, the National Archives of the Netherlands has published a composite model for Dutch-language documents of the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries called Ijsberg, trained on dozens of handwriting styles in commercial letters and notarial deeds, that has achieved a CRE rate of 5.15% <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:52" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This most frequently occured in cases that involve the conventionalized affixes of OT which violate the vowel harmony of MT. In such cases, while character-accurate transcription results in archaic-sounding pronunciation of those words (such as الدى : oldı - happened ; ١وجونجى : üçünci - third) they are still easily recognizable by modern readers; therefore, in those occasions, we opted to go with diplomatic transcription. However, in other instances, where literal transcription, i.e. transliteration, produces a pronunciation that renders the word unrecognizable to the speakers of the Turkish language (for example, خواجه : havace ; كوكرجىن : kükercin) we preferred the conventional pronunciation over character accuracy (خواجه : hoca ; كوكرجىن : güvercin). This decision did, inevitably, introduce a certain degree of inconsistency to our HTR models.&#160;<a href="#fnref:56" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The political struggle among factions in the light of the reform in late 11th century China is considered as a decisive period in the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127). Beginning in 1069, Wang Anshi carried out the  _Wang Anshi bianfa _ [Reform of Wang Anshi] under the support of Emperor Shenzong (r. 1067–1085), aiming at changing the  <em>jipinjiruo</em>  [unceasingly impoverished and weakened] situation of the state. The  <em>xinfa</em>  [new policies] initiated in the reform include a group of financial, social, and military policies that enormously changed the state’s political mechanism, thus resulting in severe resistance from the conservative officials and a long-lasting political dispute. In 1085, when Emperor Shenzong died, the Empress Dowager Gao (1032–1093) came into power. During her reign, all reform policies were abolished and most pro-reform officials were exiled. However, when she died and Emperor Zhezong (r. 1085–1100), a firm supporter of the reform, took authority, the reform policies were continued and the anti-reformers were persecuted, and this tug of war had its culmination in the uncontrollable political strife during the reign of Emperor Huizong (r. 1100–1126).</p>
<p>Because of the controversial nature of the reform, debates on it have never stopped. Since the reform was a decisive political issue of that time, all contemporary officials had to take their sides, and many of them had a fairly radical stance. For example, one anti-reformer, Yang Shi (1053–1135) claimed that  “the origin of the disaster today was because of Wang Anshi”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and imputed the collapse of Northern Song to the reform. However, many 20th century scholars argued that the reform was the only way to save the corrupt government and bring prosperity to the state. For instance, Liang Qichao held the view that Wang Anshi’s effort was a response to the need of his time, and a recuperation from the crisis <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. No matter how scholars’ views differ on the reform, its significance was undoubted, and there is a consensus that the political struggle following the reform was the direct cause of the fall of the empire.</p>
<p>The historical and cultural context of the reform should also be addressed. The Song dynasty featured  “literati politics” , a regime in which the government officials mostly came from the scholar-gentry who had earned academic degrees. Under this regime, the officials are known as scholar-officials and are both active in political and literary circles. According to the enduringly influential and widely accepted model Tang-Song transition by Naito Konan <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, the Song dynasty is considered as a decisive period of the development of the literati politics, a period when government openings began to be widely occupied by scholar-officials. The Song dynasty also witnessed an unprecedented prosperity of  <em>Daoxue</em>  [Neo-Confucianism], in which scholars were affiliated to different schools of  <em>Daoxue</em>  and held different academic and ideological views. During the reform, these scholar-officials with different academic inclinations also tended to hold different views about the reform. The shaping power of the literati’s academic backgrounds on their stances toward the reform was discussed by a 20th century scholar Cheng Yangzhi, who considered that the dispute between the reformers and the anti-reformers was rooted in their different academic opinions <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But this view is still not widely accepted, and the debate on the origin of the political struggle among factions in the light of the reform is not yet settled. Different scholarly views chiefly rise from different interpretations of existing historical sources, which are themselves not sufficient enough in many cases to serve as concrete pieces of evidence. By introducing digital methods and observing existing historical data in a more comprehensive way, however, it is possible to gain more solid arguments for the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks to the proliferation of digitized historical records, digital methods have been adopted in many studies of Sinology. Specifically, a relational database for Sinology, CBDB (China Biographical Database) <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> has inspired much research, among which the political factions in the Song dynasty (960–1279) have attracted a wealth of attention. For instance, Hilde De Weerdt et al. investigated the structure of Song dynasty faction lists on the basis of large-scale network analysis with the help of CBDB data <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, while one of our previous studies focused on the relationship between scholars and politicians in the Yuanyou Era (1086–1094) based exclusively on the data harvested from CBDB <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Following the direction opened up by previous work, this article investigates the experimental data from CBDB with exploratory statistical methods to revisit the debates around the origin of the factionalized struggle. In this sense, our research can be considered as an attempt from the community of digital humanities to facilitate the study of premodern Chinese history.</p>
<p>Following Cheng Yangzhi, but based on a totally different methodology, we try to provide a supplement to understand how close the links among scholars and politicians are by investigating the relationships among people who are active in late 11th century when the reform took place. Our study tries to verify the following hypotheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>a. People who were engaged in common literary pursuits tended to share political interests <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> .</li>
<li>b. People in common literary groups were likely to belong to the same political groups.</li>
<li>c. Literati politics and political struggle in the Northern Song dynasty interrelated with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, the first two hypotheses can be directly tested with exploratory experiments. Verifying them with quantitative evidence would strongly suggest the existence of the feature of  “literati politics” , where scholar-officials are active in both literary and political groups that formed around common literary pursuits and political interests. And since the opinion leaders in the literary world and the leaders of prominent philosophical schools in the Northern Song dynasty, such as Wang Anshi, Su Shi, and Cheng Yi, were also important politicians who carried out and resisted the reform, confirming the concomitance between political and literary relations would shed light on the origin and nature of the political struggle. In order to gain insights into it, the last hypothesis is discussed based on primary historical sources to demonstrate how the mechanism of “literati politics” actually influenced the political struggle.</p>
<p>We use quantitative methods to explore and texture literary and political affiliations among people. First, two correlation matrices constructed from the data collected from CBDB indicate their connections in literary and in political aspects, respectively. The features of the matrices, having been processed by dimensionality reduction, are then extracted as literary pursuits and political interests. Afterwards, Louvain Modularity is applied for community detection. Our experiment results in some interesting points, which can also be confirmed with primary historical sources.</p>
<p>We present a literature review on discussions of the origin and nature of the political struggle and the literati politics in part two. Our method is outlined in part three, including data collection, dimensionality reduction and community detection. The findings are shown in part four based on our results, and discussion in the context of the primary historical sources is given in part five. We offer a conclusion in part six.</p>
<h2 id="2-literature-review">2 Literature Review</h2>
<h2 id="21-origin-and-nature-of-the-struggle-among-political-factions-in-the-light-of-reform">2.1 Origin and Nature of the Struggle among Political Factions in the Light of Reform</h2>
<p>There are four typical views towards the origin and nature of the factionalized struggle in the light of the reform. The dominant view in the late 20th century Chinese academic world is that the struggle was rooted in different class interests. Yang Rongguo is a representative scholar holding the view <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. He and other scholars holding this view frequently cite the remonstration of Wen Yanbo (1006–1097) to Emperor Shenzong,  “Your majesty rules the nation with the scholar-officials, instead of the ordinary people”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The second view, chiefly held by Liang Qichao, imputes the political struggle to emotionality, and his main point is  “the members of each faction weren’t necessary to combine with each other purposefully. However, they will raise disputes whenever an issue occurs. If there is one person initiating an argument, there will be hundreds of henchmen following him. In a word, they just acted out of emotionality”   <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Liang’s opinion had a great influence on later scholars although his attribution of the political struggle to “emotionality” is criticized as oversimplifying the problem.</p>
<p>The third view is to attribute the problem to different regional ideas. It is proposed by Hu Shi in his comments on Li Gou (1009–1059), a philosopher and a countryman of Wang Anshi.  “Both Li Gou and Wang Anshi were from Jiangxi, and Wang’s thought was an inheritance of Li”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. And it is developed by Qian Mu, who further argues that  “(the criticism of the anti-reformers to Wang Anshi) was actually based on different views of the south and the north,”  and that  “the southern literati are considered frivolous while the northern literati are thought to be esteemed, thus Sima Guang (1019–1086) and his followers were incompatible with Lü Huiqing and his followers”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. This view became very influential because of Qian Mu’s widespread work,  _Guoshi dagang _ [A General History of China] <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The last view, held by Cheng Yangzhi, is to ascribe the problem to different academic opinions. He states that  “Sima Guang’s opposition to Wang Anshi’s reform was because of his political belief and his basic principle, the  <em>Dao</em> , was different from that of Wang. Wang believed that the  _Dao _ of human was separated from but based on the  <em>Dao</em>  of nature. The  _Dao _ of nature tends to change, and so should that of human. However, Sima believed the two types of  _Dao _ cannot be separated. The Dao of nature doesn’t change, and neither should that of human”   <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>All of the views above were proposed in the first half of the 20th century, and many later scholars stayed within the bounds they suggest. Luo Jiaxiang, who wrote a group of papers on this in the 1980s and 1990s, defines the reformers as  “those who take the responsibility of the nation”  and the anti-reformers as  “the political group which is both decadent and inert”   <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. From there he proposes the innovative interpretation that  “they are both the representative of the whole class of landed gentry”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, rather than considering them as different social classes. Moreover, he notices the importance of censors, the  <em>Taijian</em>  officials, claiming that they composed another significant part of the anti-reformers other than the  “decadent and inert senior politicians”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent scholars have proposed new perspectives. Li Xianchen thoroughly opposes the traditional view about different class interests, arguing that  “The dispute between Wang Anshi and Sima Guang was one within the reformers. Both of them advocated reformation, and they were just different in specific methods of reform”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. Likewise, Luo Xiaosheng claims that  “Both _ Wengong_  (honorific title of Sima Guang) and  <em>Jinggong</em>  (honorific title of Wang Anshi) had an ideal of taking the responsibility of the nation, and they both proposed a scheme of reform respectively”   <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, most of the scholars agree that the political struggle among factions in the light of the reform made a profound impact on the Northern Song politics no matter what they think the reason was. For example, Chen Zhenyang attributes the failure of the reform to the struggle among factions. He states that  “[the anti-reformers] were glad of the increment of the disadvantages of the reform and the nonfulfillment of its advantages furtively,”  and that  “Wang Anshi’s reform was in trouble because of it”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Besides, apart from the disputes between the anti-reformers and the reformers, in the Yuanyou Era, there were also debates among the anti-reformers themselves. The dispute between _ Luodang_  [the party of  <em>Luo</em> ] <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  and  <em>Shudang</em>  [the party of  <em>Shu</em> ] <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> , which was named as  “ <em>Luoshu Dangzheng</em> ”  [ <em>Luo</em> - <em>Shu</em>  faction struggle], was also of significant influence. Cheng Ruizhao believes the struggle’s influence lasted until 1155 when Qin Hui (1091–1155) dead, and even to 1224 when Emperor Lizong (r. 1224–1264) ascended to the throne <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="22-literati-politics-in-the-song-dynasty">2.2 Literati Politics in the Song Dynasty</h2>
<p>A distinct feature of premodern Chinese government (which became an autocratic monarchy governed by scholar-officials in the Ming and Qing dynasties), literati politics played a crucial role in the cultural-political life of the Song Dynasty. For example, in a case study on the Huizhou, in the period of 1200–1550, local literati’s spatial imagination resembled a mode that  “every local place was a microcosm of ‘all-under-heaven’, and thus they practiced political ideas on their local governance”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. But it was in the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) when the tendency of the importance of literati on imperial politics mushroomed notably: these scholar-officials occupied most of the government openings. This feature is considered as a part of the Tang-Song transition by the academic world.</p>
<p>The idea of the Tang-Song transition was brought up by Naitō Konan, who argues that  “the fall of the Tang dynasty was the collapse of aristocratic government in China, and the rise of monarchial autocracy and populism”   <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. According to this model, the Song dynasty was a period when the  “local elite gentry families”  replaced the  “semi-hereditary professional bureaucracy”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The influence of the literati on imperial politics was prevalent in the Song dynasty. Hilde De Weerdt finds that  <em>Daoxue</em> , the ideology held by the literati, became the official ideology in the Southern Song (1127–1279) when it adapted itself to the convention of examination culture <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Besides, Ong’s study on Guanxue, a school of Daoxue, finds it to be a bond between  “the monarch, the court, the local officials, the  _shi _ <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> , and the ordinary people”   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Deng and Lamouroux focus their attention on the importance of the literati in their study on the  _zuzong jiafa _ [ancestors’ family instruction], claiming that they  “invoked the image of a turning point in the Family Instructions”   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the Northern Song, the development of the literati politics also effectively carried cultural interactions among literati into the realm of politics. For example, Amy McNair finds that many eminent scholar-officials active in the eleventh century, including Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), Su Shi (1037–1101) and many others, promoted the calligraphy style of Yan Zhenqing (709–784) because of ideological considerations <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. For another instance, Zhang’s study on the Inn-wall writings during the Song dynasty finds them to point at  “the centrality of travel in the lives of the scholar-officials and the travelers’ representations of their experiences”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The commonness and impact of the literati’s practice of writing prefaces and postscripts to each other is attested in the idea of  <em>wen yi xu chuan</em>  [writings are disseminated because of the prefaces], which is another manifestation of the cultural-political relationships of the literati. The literati changed the function and significance of the genres of prefaces and postscripts to gradually endow them with robust political significance, especially when they wrote prefaces or postscripts for political memorials <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>.</p>
<p>These phenomena also influenced the political struggle among factions. For scholar-officials, their academic views were intimately related to their political views, exerting a deep influence on the political struggle in late 11th century. Liang Qichao noticed their relationship. In his analysis on  _Xinxue _ [the new school of  <em>Daoxue</em> ] <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> , he described it as follows:  “Whatever useful for molding the character of oneself or exerting an influence on politics are all included in his academics”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Since Wang’s philosophical ideas were intimately connected with his political ideas, his criticizers opposed it as well. Qiu Hansheng associated the academic disputation with the theory of class conflict, arguing that  “the opposition to  _Xinxue _ academically has the same meaning as the opposition to reform politically, which is class conflict”   <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. The remarkable concomitancy between academics and politics was even thought to be the reason why  <em>Xinxue</em>  failed to prosper after Wang’s death by Deng Guangming, who assumed that  “if Wang Anshi had not come into power or enacted a reform, his academic ideas…would certainly have been inherited by the Confucianists working on Confucianism principles for a long time”   <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, with literati politics, a regime in which scholar-officials dominated political life, culture and politics formed a dynamic and interactive relationship during the Song dynasty. In the case of the large-scale political struggles among factions after Wang Anshi’s reform, the interaction between literati and politicians, as well as the political nature of various literary activities, can throw light on the ensuing debates concerning their origin and nature. In the following sections, we will therefore start by studying the literary and the political relationships among the contemporaries during the reform and discuss the origin and nature of the political struggle.</p>
<h2 id="3-methods">3 Methods</h2>
<p>A framework including four data processing steps used in our study is shown in Figure 1. In the first stage, data collection, a list of people active in the era of reform is generated from CBDB, which is a relational database developed from primary historical sources. Based on the list, the data about relationships among them are extracted, which act as original data in the next stage. In the second stage, matrix construction, the relationship data of literature and politics are processed and constructed into the literary and political matrix respectively. The matrices are operated under the third stage, dimensionality reduction, which mainly extracts the feature factors of the two matrices, and the fourth stage, community detection, where communities are detected from these matrices with Louvain Modularity. Both the results of the third and the fourth stages are visualized and compared, while in the fourth stage, relation analysis is adopted after comparison. Afterwards, the overall results are interpreted and discussed. The details of the frameworks are discussed hereinafter <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> .</p>

<h2 id="31-data-collection-and-matrix-construction">3.1 Data Collection and Matrix Construction</h2>
<p>In the stage of data collection, we first generate a list of people active in the era of reform. Since people recorded in CBDB are arranged chronologically from various dynasties, we selected from the database only those who were active in the era of reform from the second year of Xining (1069) to the last year of Yuanyou (1094), 1064 being the year when Wang Anshi started the reform and 1094 the year before factional struggles turned into thorough political persecutions. Furthermore, the people selected must be at least 15 years old in 1094 since the age of 15, called  “ <em>zhi xue zhi nian</em> ”  [an age of aspiring to learn] in Chinese culture <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>, is considered the threshold of adulthood, after which one can actively participate in literature and politics. As a result, people born before 1080 (or at 1080) and dead after 1069 (or at 1069) are selected in our experiment.</p>
<p>After generating the list, we continue to extract the relation data among the people in the list generated from CBDB. In order to collect the literary relations among the people selected, the concept of bibliographic coupling <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> in the field of informetrics is adopted and adapted as  “two people who have active literary relation to a common third person”  in our study. Here,  “active literary relation”  means the person is writing (prefaces and postscripts, for instance) rather than being written for. Two people writing for a common third person implies that they share a mutual favor of this person, suggesting a closer literary bond. However, in the case of two people being written for by a common third person, there isn’t necessarily any such bond, since the third person may do this simply out of the two other people’s great reputations.</p>
<p>The method of extracting data about political relations is similar to that for literary relations, but data of direct interactions between two people, rather than their relations with common third person, are collected. Besides, these interactions are further divided into three types: explicit positive relations, implicit positive relations and negative relations. Explicit positive relations include supportive political associations, recommendation and sponsorship and part of connections via office (the connections that directly indicate intimacy), implicit positive relations include most of connections via office (the connections that do not directly indicate intimacy, such as simple colleagueship), and negative relations include oppositional political associations.</p>
<p>After data collection, the data extracted are used for matrix construction. Two correlation matrices — a literary matrix and a political matrix — are constructed, based on the data of literary relations and political relations respectively. Assume that there are  _n _ people selected from CBDB and the literary matrix can be noted as  _L nn _ . Only the relations between the  <em>i-th</em>  and the  <em>j-th</em>  people who write for (rather are written for) by a common third person are counted in the literary matrix. Whenever the  _i-th _ and the  <em>j-th</em>  people have a active literary relation with a common third person, the value of _ l ji _  in the correlation matrix is added by one. The diagonal of the matrix is set as zero due to unmeaningful relationships between the person and himself.</p>
<p>Similarly, the political matrix is noted as  _P nn _  and the value of  _p ij _  is formulated as follows.</p>
<pre><code>    p      i  j      =      p      j  i      =      e  p  r      i  j      ×  2  +      i  p  r      i  j      -      n  r      i  j       (Equation 1)
</code></pre>
<p>where       e  p  r      i  j       is the number of explicit positive relations,       i  p  r      i  j       is that of implicit positive relations, and       n  r      i  j       is that of negative relations between the  <em>i-th</em>  and the  <em>j-th</em>  people.</p>
<p>In total, 5436 records of literary relations were collected, involving 144 people who act as the person to write for another person, and 2504 people who act as the person to be written for. 1453 records of political relations among the people were collected, with ninety-six people involved.</p>
<h2 id="32-dimensionality-reduction">3.2 Dimensionality Reduction</h2>
<p>Next, both matrices are operated under dimensionality reduction, which discovers  “compact representations of high-dimensional data”  by generating a set of factors <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. Since the data in both matrices are discrete and sparse (containing many exact zeros), a Poisson-Gamma factorization model is suitable and is thus adopted for the task <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> .</p>
<p>After running the model, twelve factors were obtained from each matrix. Similar to co-citation and bibliographic coupling analysis, where key factors are explained as an academic interest shared by a group of scholars, the historical meaning of the factors can be preliminarily explained as literary pursuits and political interests respectively. This interpretation is based on the following considerations: when two or more people share literary relationships with many common people, it is likely that they are driven by a common literary pursuit; likewise, when two or more people frequently offer political aids to each other, it is highly possible that they share a certain political interest. Furthermore, the mathematical meaning of factors that a single point could have a notable value in different factors matches with the fact that a person could have various literary pursuits and could be connected to different political groups through different political interests.</p>
<p>Therefore, the people sharing a common factor can be interpretated as engaging in a common literary pursuit and sharing a certain political interest respectively, despite the fact that the precise meaning of the key factors requires further elaboration. The first extracted factors explain higher variance, and therefore are chosen as the objects of evaluation. We first discuss the people with the highest value in each factor, and offer visualizations of the results afterwards. Finally, we compare the results of dimensionality reduction of the two matrices.</p>
<h2 id="33-community-detection">3.3 Community Detection</h2>
<p>The last stage is community detection, which is also based on the two matrices. As a process of investigating the structure in a complex network, the method can aggregate and integrate all relation data among the people. Therefore, rather than adopting basic statistical methods, which separately analyze the relationships between each pair of people, community detection is capable of treating the entire social network in the reform era as a whole and analyzing it comprehensively. In this way, the results of community detection and dimensionality reduction, which suggest possible relationships among people regarding literary pursuits and political interests, can be complementary, providing a more comprehensive view of relationships among the people active in the era of the reform.</p>
<p>In community detection, for the purpose of eliminating the algorithmic bias caused by negative values, since the minimum value in the political matrix is minus four, each element is increased by a constant four so that all elements would be non-negative. Then the matrices are converted into social networks, where the weight of edge between the  <em>i-th</em>  and the  <em>j-th</em>  people is the value of  _l ji _  and  _p ji _  of the literary matrix and political matrix respectively. Next, community detection is carried out in Gephi, which is an open-source software for graph and network analysis <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. We lay out the original network by Yifan Hu multilevel layout <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>, partition it using Louvain Modularity <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> , and determine the number of communities based on the resolution value from Laplacian dynamics <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> . Finally, the communities detected are considered as literary and political groups respectively. There are four core communities detected in the literary network and seven in the political network.</p>
<p>Similar to dimensionality reduction, the results of community detection are analyzed separately and comparatively. When comparing the results of literary groups and political groups, the research adopts methods of relation analysis, referring to the main idea of association rule learning to evaluate the similarity between them. Association rule learning is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using measures of interestingness <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. In this article, each person is considered as a one-item set, in order to study the distribution of the people in different literary groups and political groups. Specifically, the research defines frequency (referencing to the concept of support in association rule learning) of a certain literary group  _x 0 _  and a political group  _y 0 _  as the ratio of the number of people who appear in both of the groups, to the total number of people who appear in any literary group and any political group. The formula is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>f  (      x      0      ,      y      0      )  =      N  (      x      0      ,      y      0      )        ∑    x  ⊂  X  ,  y  ⊂  Y          N  (  x  ,  y  )       (Equation 2)
</code></pre>
<p>And it defines the ratio of the political group (referring to the concept of confidence in association rule learning) of a certain literary group  _x 0 _  and a political group  _y 0 _  as the ratio of the number of people who appeared in both of the groups, to the total number of people who appear in any literary group and the specific political group. The formula is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>r  (      x      0      ,      y      0      )  =      N  (      x      0      ,      y      0      )        ∑    x  ⊂  X          N  (  x  ,      y      0      )       (Equation 3)
</code></pre>
<p>According to the basic idea of association rule learning, association rules are required to satisfy both a minimum support and a minimum confidence constraint at the same time <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. Therefore, based on the formulae above, literary group  _x 0 _  and political group  _y 0 _  are considered as related if parameters   f          x      0      ,      y      0           and   r          x      0      ,      y      0           satisfy a threshold constraint at the same time. After experiments, we find setting threshold constraints of       f      m  i  n      =3% and       r      m  i  n      =25% reasonable, therefore the groups that satisfy the constraints will be considered as related.</p>
<h2 id="4-experimental-results-and-analysis">4 Experimental Results and Analysis</h2>
<h2 id="41-dimensionality-reduction">4.1 Dimensionality Reduction</h2>
<p>Twelve key factors of a matrix are produced after dimensionality reduction on the literary matrix. Mean squared error (MSE) is adopted to measure the difference between the estimator and what is estimated, the factors that are extracted from the original matrix. Randomness or unaccountable information in the estimator is the major cause of the difference, thus the value of the MSE is positively related to the error <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The algorithm is run iteratively 400 times, and the MSE of dimensionality reduction of the literary matrix is 0.233. Since the first extracted factor is not interpretable as all people have the same value on it, we chose to evaluate the factors ranking from second to fourth. And for each factor, we picked the ten people with the highest values. The factor matrix is shown in Table 1.<br>
People that have the highest values in the literary matrix after dimensionality reduction    Factor  Name      2  Su Shi, Huang Tingjian, Su Zhe, Wang Anshi, Bi Zhongyou, Chao Yuezhi, Su Song, Zhang Lei, Qiang Zhi, Han Qi      3  Yang Shi, Hu Anguo, Liao Gang, Luo Congyan, Ye Mengde, Su Zhe, Chen Guan, Cheng Ju, Yin Tun, Cheng Yi      4  Yang Shi, You Zuo, Cheng Yi, Cheng Hao, Li Guang, Chao Yuezhi, Han Wei, Chen Guan, Yin Tun, Zhu Guangting   <br>
Through the results of dimensional reduction of literary relations, people who have the highest value in factors listed in Table 1 can be explained as  “engaged in common literary interests” .</p>
<p>People with the highest values in factor  <em>2</em>  include Su Shi (1037–1101), his brother Su Zhe (1039–1112), his students Huang Tingjian (1045–1105) and Zhang Lei (1054–1114), and his close friends Bi Zhongyou (1047–1121) and Chao Yuezhi (1059–1129). Therefore, this factor indicates a group highly related to Su Shi, the leader of  _Shuxue _ [the school of  <em>Shu</em> ] <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>  and it can be explained as literary interest of  <em>Shuxue</em> .</p>
<p>People with the highest values in factor  <em>3</em>  and  _4 _ include Cheng Hao (1032–1185), Cheng Yi (1033–1107), their students Yang Shi (1053–1135), You Zuo (1053–1123), Zhu Guangting (1037–1094) and Yin Tun (1071–1142), the students of Yang Shi, Hu Anguo (1074–1138), Liao Gang (1070–1143) and Luo Congyan (1072–1135), and academics such as Chen Guan (1057–1124). Yang Shi and You Zuo are among the  <em>Chengmen si xiansheng</em>  [four outstanding students of the Cheng’s school] and Chen Guan is also deeply influenced by the two Chengs (Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi). Thus, the factors  _3 _ and  <em>4</em>  can be explained as literary interest of  _Luoxue _ [the school of  <em>Luo</em> ] <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> .</p>
<p>The result of dimensionality reduction of literary matrix with factor  <em>2</em> ,  <em>3</em> , and  <em>4</em>  is shown in Figure 2. It is divided into three sections: 1) Sect.  <em>A</em>  (includes people with high values in factor  _3 _ and  <em>4</em> ) representing  <em>Luoxue</em> , 2) Sect.  <em>B</em>  representing  <em>Shuxue</em>  (includes people with high value in factor  <em>2</em> ), and 3) Sect.  <em>C</em>  representing  _Xinxue _ (includes people with no high value in factor  <em>2</em> ,  <em>3</em>  or  <em>4</em> ).</p>

<p>The political matrix is also reduced to twelve factors, which are explained as political interests. The algorithm is run iteratively 400 times and the MSE of dimensionality reduction of the political matrix was 0.395. The first-extracted two factors are selected and the ten people with the highest value are picked.<br>
People that have the highest values in the political matrix after dimensionality reduction    Factor  Name      1  Sima Guang, Wang Gongchen, Zhao Bian, Cheng Yi, Sun Yong, Su Shi, Fan Chunli, Yin Tun, Mei Zhili, Wang Anli      2  Lü Huiqing, Lü Gongzhu, Zhang Dun, Wang Gongchen, Shao Yong, Emperor Shenzong, Sun Jue, Cai Jing, Wang Anguo, Li Qingchen   <br>
People with the highest values in factor  <em>1</em>  are mostly anti-reformers, including Sima Guang, Wang Gongchen (1012–1085), Zhao Bian (1008–1084), Cheng Yi, Sun Yong (1019–1086), Su Shi and Fan Chunli (1031–1106). Among them, Sima Guang, Cheng Yi, Su Shi and Fan Chunli are listed in the  <em>Yuanyou dangji bei</em>  [Stele of the  <em>Yuanyou</em>  Faction Members] <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> . Furthermore, Sima Guang was the leader of the anti-reformers, Cheng Yi was the leader of  <em>Luodang</em> , and Su Shi was the leader of  <em>Shudang</em> .</p>
<p>People with the highest values in factor  <em>2</em>  include Emperor Shenzong, who was the emperor to carry out the reform, Zhang Dun (1035–1105), Lü Huiqing (1032–1111), Cai Jing (1047–1126) and Li Qingchen (1032–1102), who were all reformers and among whom Zhang Dun and Lü Huiqing were listed in the  <em>Wang Anshi qindang</em>  [accomplice of Wang Anshi] by Liang Tao (1034–1097) <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The result of dimensionality reduction of the political matrix with factor _ 1_  and  <em>2</em>  is shown in Figure 3. It is divided into four sections. Sect.  <em>A</em>  and  _B _ represent reformers, and Sect.  <em>C</em>  and  <em>D</em>  represents anti-reformers. Moreover, different sects of reformers and anti-reformers are also separated. Relatively mild reformers, Emperor Shenzong (named Zhao Xu, who both supported the reform and respected the anti-reformers), and Cai Jing (he hovered between reformers and anti-reformers before coming to power) are in Sect.  <em>B</em>  while more radical reformers, Zhang Dun and Lü Huiqing are in Sect.  <em>A</em> . Among the anti-reformers, the members of  <em>Shudang</em> , who had relatively mild political views, are mostly in Sect.  <em>C</em> , including Su Zhe, Lü Tao (1028–1104) and Kong Wenzhong (1038–1088) <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> . And those who had more radical political views, are mostly in Sect.  <em>D</em> . The transition from Sect.  _A _ to Sect.  _D _ corresponds with the transition of political views from radical reformers to radical anti-reformers.</p>

<p>Synthesizing the results above, we find that the reformers are all mostly in Sect.  <em>C</em>  in Figure 2 and in Sect.  _A _ and  <em>B</em>  in Figure 3, while among the anti-reformers, followers of  <em>Shuxue</em>  are mostly in Sect.  _B _ in Figure 2 and Sect.  <em>C _ in Figure 3, those of _ Luoxue</em>  are mostly in Sect.  <em>A</em>  in Figure 2 and Sect.  <em>D</em>  in Figure 3. Therefore, we can confirm our original hypothesis that those who were engaged in common literary pursuits usually shared political interests with each other.</p>
<h2 id="42-community-detection">4.2 Community Detection</h2>
<p>The correlation matrices are operated under Gephi, and a literary network and a political network are generated based on the data of the matrices respectively. After laying out and partitioning the networks, they are divided into several communities. The result of community detection of literary network is shown in Figure 4, with the size of the nodes representing the importance of the person:</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are four core communities detected in the network, each representing a group of literati. Other communities are dispersed in the edge of the network and consist of only one component, thus should be considered as unimportant. The findings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>a. Su Shi, Huang Tingjian, Sima Guang, Su Zhe, Wang Anshi and Fan Chunren (1021–1101) are all attributed to Group  <em>A</em> , which can be considered a core literary group.</li>
<li>b. Although the components of Group  <em>A</em>  are complicated, Su Shi plays an extremely important role in it. Many of his family members (his brother Su Zhe and son Su Guo (1072–1123)), his students (Huang Tingjian, Zhang Lei, Chen Shidao (1053–1102) and Li Zhi (1059–1109)), his friends (Bi Zhongyou (1047–1121), Shi Huihong (1071–1128) and Mi Fu (1051–1107)), and his political allies (Lü Tao and Kong Wenzhong) are in the group. Most people in group A are mild anti-reformers, and many of them are followers of  <em>Shuxue</em> .</li>
<li>c. Most components of Group  <em>B</em>  are firm anti-reformers, including Liu Anshi (1048–1125) and many followers of  <em>Luoxue</em>  (Cheng Yi, Cheng Hao, Yang Shi, You Zuo, Zhu Guangting, Yin Tun, Hu Anguo, Liao Gang and Luo Congyan).</li>
<li>d. Most components of Group  <em>C</em>  are reformers or have sympathy for reform. Those people include Zhang Dun, Lü Huiqing, Peng Ruli (1041–1095), Cai Bian (1048–1117), who were typical reformers and were listed in  <em>Wang Anshi qindang</em>  by Liang Tao <sup id="fnref1:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>, and Liu Yan (1048–1102), who was neither reformers nor anti-reformers but was friendly to reformers. Besides, most followers of  <em>Xinxue</em>  are in it.</li>
<li>e. The components of Group  <em>D</em>  are mostly senior politicians active during the reign of Emperor Renzong (r. 1022–1063), including Han Qi (1008–1075), Fu Bi (1004–1083), Wen Yanbo (1006–1097), Wang Gui (1019–1085), Zhang Fangping (1007–1091) and Qiang Zhi (1022–1076).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this categorization is reductive: people cannot be categorized into merely one or another literary or political group. However, as found above, despite some exceptions (such as the leader of reformers, Wang Anshi, is in the core group  <em>A</em> , instead of Group  <em>C</em> ), the groups detected by the modularity algorithm still imply analytically-durable literary and political relations. These findings suggest the literary group a person belongs to corresponds to the person’s political views. Moreover, an interesting discovery is that the position in Figure 4 (which represents the position of the person in literary network) correlates to the person’s views on reform.</p>
<p>The modularity of the political network is similar to that of the literary network. Since the matrix is high-density and most of the values in the matrix are around four (if two people don’t have associations in politics, the value of the element demonstrating the strength of their relation is four owing to our normalization during preprocessing), the degree range of the filter is set to be “greater than four” so that all of the edges shown connect two people that are positively related in politics. The result are as follows:</p>

</figure>
<p>Figure 5 shows fifty-four people in seven core communities. In a manner similar to the literary network, other unimportant communities are dispersed in the edge of the network and consist of very few components (at most three). The constituents of the seven core communities all have positive political relations with at least one person in the network.</p>
<p>The communities, each representing a political group, are reasonably clear. Following the labels shown in Figure 5, the analyses of Group  <em>A</em> ,  <em>B</em> ,  <em>C</em> ,  <em>D</em>  and  _E _ are as follows (size of group  <em>F</em>  and  <em>G</em>  being too small to analyze):</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people in  **Group  <em>A</em> **  are firm anti-reformers, including Sima Guang, Fan Chunren, Fan Chunli (1031–1106), Cheng Yi, Zhu Guangting, Liu Anshi (the above six people are listed in the  <em>Yuanyou dangji bei</em> ), and Liu Shu. Sima Guang is the most important person in the group and the two distinct members of  _Luodang _ are both in it.</li>
<li>Most people in  **Group  _B _ ** are radical reformers, including Zhang Dun, Zeng Bu (1036–1107), Cai Jing, Cai Bian, Zhao Tingzhi (1040–1107) and Zhang Shangying (1043–1121), all of the above people were listed in the  <em>Wang Anshi qindang</em>   <sup id="fnref2:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. Zhang Dun is the most important person in the group.</li>
<li>The leading figure in  **Group  <em>C</em> **  is Su Shi. Most of people in it are mild anti-reformers, including many  <em>Shudang</em>  members. It contains Su Shi, his students (Huang Tingjian and Chen Shidao), his political ally (Kong Wenzhong), and also Wang Anli (1034–1095), brother of Wang Anshi.</li>
<li>The leading figure in  **Group  <em>D</em> **  is Wang Anshi. It contains reformers (Lü Huiqing), and also Emperor Shenzong (named Zhao Xu).</li>
<li>Most people in  **Group  _E _ ** are senior politicians and anti-reformers, including Han Qi, Fu Bi, Su Song (1020–1101), Qiang Zhi and Feng Jing (1021–1094).</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings demonstrate the reliability of the data in the political matrix, and the network accurately reflects the political situation in the era of reform. An exception can be found in group  <em>C</em> , where a mild reformer, Wang Anli, appears in the group of mild anti-reformers. This is considered as an outlier of the network, which will be discussed in part 5.1.</p>
<p>Finally, we analyze the relations between literary groups and political groups referring to the main idea of association rule learning. The groups considered as related are shown in Table 3:<br>
Related literary groups and political groups    Political Group  Literary Group  Frequency  Ratio of the Political Group      A   A  9.80%  38.46%      A  B  13.73%  53.85%      B  A  5.88%  33.33%      B  C  5.88%  33.33%      C  A  13.73%  77.78%      D  A  3.92%  28.57%      D  C  3.92%  28.57%      D  D  3.92%  28.57%      E  A  5.88%  50.00%      E  D  5.88%  50.00%      F  A  3.92%  50.00%      G  B  5.88%  75.00%   <br>
The results of relation analysis show twelve pairs of related political and literary groups, and they imply a close relationship between these groups. For example, political group  <em>A</em>  (firm anti-reformers) is related to literary group  <em>A</em>  (core group) and  <em>B</em>  (anti-reformers), and political group  <em>B</em>  (radical reformers) is related to literary group  <em>A</em>  (core group) and  <em>C</em>  (reformers). Specifically, those who were followers of  <em>Luoxue</em>  are mostly in literary group  <em>B</em> , and members of  <em>Luodang</em>  are mostly in political group  <em>A</em> , which are strongly related (highest  _f _ 13.73% and third-highest  <em>r</em>  53.85%). Similarly, those who were followers of  <em>Shuxue</em>  are mostly in literary group  <em>A</em> , and members of  <em>Shudang</em>  are mostly in political group  <em>C</em> , which are also strongly related (highest  _f _ 13.73% and highest  <em>r</em>  77.78%).</p>
<p>In general, the results confirm our original hypothesis that those who shared a literary group were more likely to share a political group.</p>
<h2 id="5-discussion">5 Discussion</h2>
<h2 id="51-positive-interactions-between-reformers-and-anti-reformers">5.1 Positive Interactions between Reformers and Anti-Reformers</h2>
<p>In Figure 5, there is an outlier in the political network: Wang Anli is found to appear in the group of mild anti-reformers. This outlier is derived from the following historical record:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Su Shi was imprisoned in the jail of the Censorate. He was in extreme danger and no one dared to save him. Wang Anli said (to Emperor Shenzong) calmly, ‘since ancient times, magnanimous emperors do not convict others because of their sayings.…If Your Majesty sentenced him (Su Shi) strictly according to the law, I am afraid that Your Majesty will be criticized by later generations as intolerant to the talents.’…Thus Su Shi was only punished lightly<br>
. <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br>
This is far from the only record showing positive interactions between reformers and anti-reformers. Actually, Su Shi, the leader of  <em>Shudang</em> , and Wang Anshi, the leader of the reformers, showed respect to each other. When Su was relegated and went past Jinling <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> , he advised Wang to exhort the emperor in return for being thought highly by the emperor. Feeling respected, Wang accepted his advice and warned him not to tell anybody else <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In the record, it is clear that Su thought highly of Wang, and Wang trusted Su and treated him as an intimate friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wang also listened to the advice of Su Zhe, who was the brother of Su Shi. When he carried out the reform policies, he asked for the opinion of Su Zhe on the  _qingmiaofa _ [green sprouts policy] <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup> . When Su proposed objection, Wang answered:  “What you said was really reasonable, I should rethink it carefully.”  And he stopped talking about  _qingmiaofa _ for several months <sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Similar records are not only found in those concerning the amiable relations between the reformers and the members of  <em>Shudang</em> , who held relatively mild attitudes towards the reform, but also between reformers and other more radical anti-reformers. During the reign of Emperor Shenzong, who was the main supporter of the reform, the firm anti-reformers were still high-rank officials. Fu Bi, Wu Chong (1021–1080), Feng Jing, Wen Yanbo, Lü Gongbi (1007–1073) had all assumed offices of what was equivalent to the prime minister <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. Emperor Shenzong showed great tolerance and respect for the anti-reformers despite their political views, enabling positive and amiable interactions.</p>
<p>Moreover, even the firmest anti-reformers tried to mediate with the reformers. In the fifth year of Yuanyou (1090), Liu Zhi (1030–1098), the leader of  _Shuodang _ [the party of  <em>Shuo</em> ] <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> , together with Lü Dafang (1027–1097) advised appointing the reformers as officials in order to alleviate the existing resentment between the reformers and anti-reformers. And they called it mediation  <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. In spite of factions, struggles and disputes, there are still a number of records showing positive interactions between reformers and anti-reformers, especially those of  <em>Shudang</em> .</p>
<h2 id="52-anti-reformers-views-on-the-reform">5.2 Anti-Reformers’ Views on the Reform</h2>
<p>We next investigated the difference between the reformers’ and the anti-reformers’ political views, in order to discover to what extent they really hold irreconcilable political views.</p>
<p>The anti-reformers who held the least radical views on the reform were still the members of  <em>Shudang</em> . During the reign of Emperor Renzong, Su Shi wrote a memorial to the Emperor stating the urgency of the reform.  “Nowadays, if we do not cleanse the old, we will not be able to establish something eminent”   <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. In his early years, Su Shi strongly approved of the reform and was taunted by Zhu Xi (1130–1200) because of it. Zhu criticized that Su  “talked about improving government finance in his early years, but never talked about it after seeing the failure of _ qingmiaofa_ . He talked about military actions in his early years…but never talked about it after seeing the failure of Wang Anshi’s military actions.”   <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup></p>
<p>Su Shi was not the only one who urged reform. Although criticizing Su Shi, Zhu Xi admitted that  “not only  <em>Jinggong</em>  (Wang Anshi) wanted to reform, but all of the wise men then had an intention for reform”   <sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup> when discussing the situation of the era before the reform. Therefore, we can conclude that there was a consensus among officials on the eve of the era of reform, whether reformers or anti-reformers, when the reform was carried out by Wang Anshi.</p>
<p>Moreover, during the era of the reform, members of  <em>Shudang</em>  still held relatively mild attitudes, even if they opposed it in general. When Sima Guang came into power and tried to abolish Wang Anshi’s policies, some members of  <em>Shudang</em>  argued against it. For instance, in the Yuanyou Era, Sima Guang planned to change the standard of imperial examination set by Wang Anshi. Su Zhe argued that since the next examination would take place very soon, it would be difficult for the examinees to adapt to the new standard. So he advised Sima to follow the standard set by Wang Anshi in the next year and consider changes afterwards <sup id="fnref4:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Although Sima Guang didn’t take his advice, it was clear that Su Zhe held a relatively neutral view on the reform even in the Yuanyou Era, when political struggle grew more severe.</p>
<p>In conclusion, before the era of the reform, most anti-reformers still approved of reform to a certain degree. And during the era of the reform, the members of  _Shudang _ still held relatively mild views on it. The mild perspectives held by anti-reformers and the positive interactions between them and reformers imply that in the early period of the reform, political struggle among factions was controllable and rational to some extent, and that there were no irreconcilable conflicts between the reformers and anti-reformers despite their differences.</p>
<h2 id="53-worsened-political-situation">5.3 Worsened Political Situation</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, the situation worsened as time went on. The first to be persecuted were the members of  <em>Shudang</em> , especially Su Shi, who was described by Liu Anshi as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Yuanfeng Era (1078–1085), the reformers were intolerant of him and wanted to kill him. In the Yuanyou Era, there was also dissension between him and the old gentlemen (i.e. the anti-reformers). He is not a man to fluctuate as situation changes.<br>
<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup><br>
As a result, he was relegated in the Xining Era (1068–1077) and the Yuanfeng Era when the reformers were in power, and was also forced to leave the capital in the Yuanyou Era when the anti-reformers were in power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The members of  _Shudang _ were not the only ones persecuted when the political struggle worsened. In the Yuanyou Era, reformers were massively persecuted. Fan Chunren, one of the anti-reformers, summed up the situation of political persecution as follows:  “In my opinion, the origin of the factions is because of political views. Those who have the same view with me are considered to be righteous, while those who have different views are doubted to be devious”   <sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the Southern Song dynasty, when the arguments around the reform came to the definitive conclusion that the reform had been a mistake, people’s judgement on reformers and anti-reformers completely depended on their political views: the anti-reformers received praises and honors, while the reformers, no matter who they were, were severely criticized. In  _Guochao zhu chen zouyi _ [Memorials of All Ministers of Our Dynasty] edited by Zhao Ruyu (1140–1196), which was a collection of political memorials, the number of memorials of each person selected showed an overt relationship with their political views. Firm anti-reformers had the most memorials selected, for example, Sima Guang had 146, Lü Hui (1014–1071) had forty-five, Fu Bi had forty-four, Liu Zhi had thirty-four. Members of  <em>Shudang</em>  had less than that, with Su Zhe having twenty-four, and Su Shi having twenty-three. The memorials of the reformers were rarely selected. Wang Anshi had only six, while none of those written by Lü Huiqing, Zhang Dun or Zeng Bu were selected <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>. Only the anti-reformers were able to have their works memorialized, and the reformers were officially forgotten.</p>
<h2 id="54-influence-of-literati-politics-on-political-struggle">5.4 Influence of Literati Politics on Political Struggle</h2>
<p>In 5.1 and 5.2 we discussed positive interactions between reformers and anti-reformers and the anti-reformers’ views of the reform. We concluded that, at first, there were no irreconcilable conflicts between reformers and anti-reformers. But we found that conditions of political civility deteriorated in the last decades of 12th century, and the findings in part 4 offer a persuasive explanation for this: what we have called throughout literati politics. We conclude that those engaged in common literary pursuits were more likely to share political goals, and that shared affiliation to literary groups is likely to indicate shared affiliation to political groups. Both conclusions suggest the basic constitution of literati politics, which in turn exerts a deep influence on factionalized struggle.</p>
<p>The relatively mild view held by members of  <em>Shudang</em>  on the reform corresponded to the similarity of their academic views to those avowed by reformers. In the epitaph of his brother Su Shi, Su Zhe recalled that when Su Shi read  _Zhuangzi _ <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> , he found it resonant with his own ideas. And when he read the Sutras, he likewise reconciled it with Confucianism and Taoism <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>. The idea of fusing Confucianism with Taoism and Buddhism to a certain degree was identical to the proposals made by Wang Anshi. Therefore, both were criticized as profaning orthodox Confucianism.</p>
<p>Zhu Xi, a representative of the orthodox Confucianists, stated that  “Wang Anshi and Su Shi regarded the Buddha and Laozi <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  as sages, and thus their academics were not pure Confucianism academics”   <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. Therefore, he criticized both of them that  “the academics of both of them were illicit.”   <sup id="fnref2:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. And he also extended the criticism to politics.  “If Su Shi had been the prime minister, and invited Qin Guan (1049–1100), Huang Tingjian and other companies to assist him, things would have become worse (than what was caused by Wang Anshi)”   <sup id="fnref3:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The similarities between the philosophical perspectives of the members of  <em>Shudang</em>  and reformers correlates to the  <em>Shudang</em>  members’ mild attitude towards the reform. And since their academics,  <em>Shuxue</em> , was quite different from  <em>Luoxue</em> , they were in dispute with the members of  <em>Luodang</em>  in the Yuanyou Era when anti-reformers came into power. Similarly, the dispute between the reformers and the anti-reformers can also be explained by their differences in academic inclinations.</p>
<p>The distinct features of literati politics in the Song dynasty led to the extremely important social status of the literati. The actions of scholar-officials tended to be value-rational instead of instrumentally rational  <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup> . Unlike officials in a typical bureaucratic government, they took actions based on their own senses of value, which was a natural result of the prosperity of  <em>Daoxue</em> . It made the Song dynasty a golden age for the literati. However, it also resulted in inevitable disputes among the scholar-officials who held different academic views. Since the scholar-officials had the identity of literatus and official at the same time, their academic views would strongly influence their political views, which brought about political struggles. Even worse, the scholar-officials in the Song dynasty were concerned with Confucianism, which itself pertained largely to value judgements. Therefore, they criticized those who held different academic views, and eventually gave moral judgements on them. This was the chief reason why normal political struggles would turn into disastrous persecutions according to <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. The findings of this paper on the extreme intimacy between the literary relations and political relations among the people active in the era of reform strongly reinforce this interpretation of the period.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a paradox remains, namely that in the Southern Song dynasty, the dispute between  <em>Luoxue</em>  and  _Shuxue _ finally turned into the fusion of different ideas and ideologies. Scholars such as Liu Guangzu (1142–1222) and Wei Liaoweng (1178–1237) worked to bring about the fusion of  _Luoxue _ and  <em>Shuxue</em> . To some extent, Zhu Xi, who epitomized the idea of  <em>Luoxue</em>  and critically inherited  <em>Shuxue</em> , also carried on the process <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>. In this way, academic disputes were solved. However, the political disputes which had their roots in those academic disputes were never successfully mitigated, and finally they accelerated the collapse of the Northern Song dynasty.</p>
<h2 id="6-conclusion">6 Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the help of digital methods, this article preliminarily confirms that it was the literati’s different academic views that caused and exacerbated the political struggle, and the regime of literati politics was largely responsible for it. In part four we have found a distinct feature of literati politics from the results of our data analysis. And in part five, beginning with an outlier found in the automatically generated social network, we went back to the primary historical sources, and found that there were not irreconcilable conflicts between the reformers and anti-reformers at first. Further, in order to explain the reason why the political struggle worsened, we found that the development of literati politics in the Song dynasty offered a persuasive cause.</p>
<p>In this article, the original data obtained from CBDB are entirely based on historical records, and the reliability of the findings generated by digital methods that distantly aggregate historical sources are further validated by traditional methods that closely look through such sources. This is particularly necessary as both dimensionality reduction and community detection algorithms adopted in this article belong to the class of unsupervised learning. However, it should be noted that, without access to the workings of CBDB, work in this field would be held back. Moreover, the specific ways in which literati politics impacted political struggle still need elaboration in further studies, and our methodology can also be adapted by researchers in other fields such as exploring correlations between economic and political perspectives.</p>
<p>With the above caveats in place, we can conclude that, as found in part four, although literary relations and political relations among people have their own characteristics, they have many clear connections during the era of the reform, making it a typical era with highly-related culture and politics. Therefore, based on the suggestiveness of the data and the confirmation offered by the primary historical records, this article reinforces the view held by Cheng Yangzhi on the origin and nature of political struggle surrounding the issue of reform, ascribing the problem to different academic opinions <sup id="fnref2:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This result may shed light on further studies on the origin of the political struggle. This paper offers one way to bring to a close the debate on the origin and nature of the struggle among political factions in the reform era. Of course, other factors such as class interests, regionalism and simple emotionality still have weight, but literati politics offers the most comprehensive probative value of any of the possible explanations. Moreover, our paper also proves the explanatory force of the Tang-Song transition model <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> on Song politics. Scholars of ancient and medieval history have formed a critical tradition of analyzing and interpreting the limited sources available to them. We emphasize that the digital methods in this article are the intellectual successors to, and share in, this spirit of critical imagination.</p>
<p>Niu Xi imputed the origin of the political struggle among  <em>Luodang</em> ,  <em>Shudang</em>  and  <em>Shuodang</em>  as follows:  “The disputation had nothing to do with policies, nor with principles. It was just a disputation based on regionalism, parochialism, companionship between teachers and students, and academic styles”   <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>. This statement is not only applicable for this specific political struggle among the anti-reformers. In the whole process of the political struggle among factions around reform, neither the disputations between the reformers and anti-reformers, nor those among anti-reformers, were fundamentally irreconcilable.</p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged that the relation between the scholars and politicians became increasingly close in medieval China, and the feature of literati politics became more and more significant through the dynasties. Consequently, China eventually transformed into an autocratic monarchy governed by scholar-officials in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Song dynasty acted as a pivotal period of the transformation with its distinct feature of literati politics, under the rubric of which scholar-officials holding different academic views criticized the political opinions of others, such that even political persecutions could be entirely driven by moral judgements.</p>

However, it has a complex nature. Because of the monopolization of Cai Jing, the prime minister who created the stele, the 309 officials listed in the stele were actually far beyond merely anti-reformers. Rather, Cai Jing used the stele as a tool to suppress his political opponents. Even one of the firmest reformers, Zhang Dun, was listed in it because of his hostility to Cai Jing. Therefore, it shouldn’t be considered as an objective tool to distinguish the anti-reformers, although it is the only available historical source which stated to list the anti-reformers.&#160;<a href="#fnref:51" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Introduction<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Many and diverse scientific communities, including digital textual scholars, have shown increasing interest in semantic web technologies and linked open data (LOD) as a means of knowledge representation since the early 2000s, when Tim Berners-Lee coined the concept of a web of interconnected data rather than simply documents (see<a href="#spadini2021">#spadini2021</a>). Nonetheless, there is a lack of user-friendly tools for working with digital scholarly editions and LOD.</p>
<p><em>Linked data from TEI</em> (LIFT) is a Digital Humanities tool for generating linked open data (LOD) from TEI-encoded texts. LIFT, which is accessible athttps://projects.dharc.unibo.it/lift, provides a set of TEI-to-LOD transformation scripts written in Python. The scripts, addressing the transformation of different types of entities to LOD, are thoroughly documented to facilitate their understanding and reuse. The purpose of this paper is to introduce LIFT as a teaching tool for supporting the adoption of linked open data in digital scholarly editing. Our plan is to use LIFT as part of a laboratory activity for the University of Bologna’s Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge, which will combine the knowledge and skills acquired by the students from different modules: text encoding with the TEI, ontology development, Python programming, and linked open data for cultural heritage.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This paper first provides a brief background on linked open data and their use in digital text representation (seeSection 2). It then goes on to consider related work in the field of TEI to LOD transformation (seeSection 3) as well as to introduce LIFT from both a technical and methodological perspective (seeSection 4). Finally, it discusses the potential application of LIFT in digital humanities learning contexts (seeSection 5andSection 6).</p>
<h2 id="2-background">2. Background</h2>
<p>The concept of linked open data refers to a method of publishing structured data – as well as organizing knowledge – on the web in such a way that they can be semantically interlinked to form open clouds of integrated information. As is already well known, LOD are based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF), a graph data model used for making statements about resources. Each RDF statement contains a subject, a predicate, and an object, represented by unique URIs. The subject is the resource being described, the object is either a characteristic of the subject (such as its type) or a resource related to the subject, and the predicate expresses the relationship between the subject and the object (seeexample 1 below). The meaning of RDF data is defined by machine-readable ontologies, formal descriptions of specific concepts within a domain and the relationships holding between them.</p>
<h1 id="an-rdf-representation-of-the-statement-alexander-the-great-has-parent-philip-ii-of-macedon-extracted-from-dbpedia">An RDF representation of the statement “Alexander the Great has parent Philip II of Macedon” (extracted from DBpedia).</h1>
<p><a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great</a> # Alexander the Great <a href="http://dbpedia.org/ontology/parent">http://dbpedia.org/ontology/parent</a> # has parent <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_Macedon">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_Macedon</a> # Philip II of Macedon<br>
RDF statements can be used to represent information in digital scholarly editions as linked open data.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> To cite just a few examples, theHenry III Fine Rolls editionexperiments with linked data to express complex relationships between people in historical documents (see<a href="#ciula2008">#ciula2008</a>). TheSharing Ancient Wisdoms project, on the other hand, uses linked data to reconstruct text interaction (see<a href="#jordanous2012">#jordanous2012</a>), while thePaolo Bufalini’s Notebook editionuses linked data to represent the interconnections between the various types of fragments – quotations, translations, and annotations – that make up the text (see<a href="#daquino2019">#daquino2019</a>). Similar information extracted from texts, in addition to administrative, structural, and descriptive metadata, can make a significant contribution to the development of a cultural heritage linked open data cloud: texts do indeed occupy a prominent space in cultural heritage representation. However, in order to reuse and integrate texts into LOD systems, information must first be expressed in RDF according to widely used ontologies in the digital humanities and cultural heritage domains.</p>
<p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), an XML vocabulary for encoding texts in the humanities, is the de facto standard for digital scholarly editing.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The standard defines terms for representing a wide range of textual entities, including personal names, place names, dates, concepts, and events. Unlike RDF, the TEI has traditionally taken a document-centric approach to representing such entities, with texts processed as ordered hierarchies of content objects nesting neatly one inside the other (see<a href="#derose1990">#derose1990</a>and<a href="#renear1993">#renear1993</a>). However, transitioning from a document-centric paradigm to a data-centric paradigm, such as LOD, is not an easy task: converting TEI editions into graphs of RDF statements necessitates a conceptual shift in which texts are no longer viewed as documents but as collections of interconnected entities (see<a href="#tomasi2012">#tomasi2012</a>).</p>
<p>The movement beyond TEI towards linked open data began in 2004, when a TEI Special Interest Group on Ontologies was formed with the goal of investigating the feasibility of encoding information about persons, dates, events, places and objects outside the text, in parallel with the steps taken by the Museum community, which was working on the development of CIDOC CRM, an ontological vocabulary for the description of museum collections (see<a href="#teiontologies">#teiontologies</a>). The new P5 release of the TEI in 2007 introduced new elements for distinguishing real-world entities from their in-text occurrences<a href="#wittern2009">#wittern2009</a>. This change, along with the addition of new attributes that could be used to link an entity to external authority records (seeexample 2 below), made it easier to express relationships between entities in TEI and extract them as RDF statements.</p>

<p><person sameAs="http://viaf.org/viaf/101353608">Alexander the Great</person><br>
Despite these meaningful developments, there are very few user-friendly tools for working with TEI editions and LOD<a href="#pierazzo2016">#pierazzo2016</a>. The fact that the TEI guidelines are not intended to be strictly followed complicates matters: annotators can encode the same textual features in different ways, depending on the project. Because no two texts or editions are identical, this flexibility is required; however, the unavoidable drawback is a certain loss of interoperability (see<a href="#andrews2013">#andrews2013</a>). Enhancing TEI-encoded texts with linked open data represents a possible way of overcoming this limitation.</p>
<p>Being willing to introduce DHDK students to the extraction of linked open data from TEI-encoded texts, we ran into a lack of user-friendly tools capable of raising awareness about both the methodology and the technology that underpin such operation. LIFT was created to fill this gap.</p>

Because the TEI is an XML vocabulary, digital textual scholars have naturally adopted XSLT as their primary transformation language from TEI to other formats including RDF/XML, which is one of the possible serializations of LOD graphs. The TEI Consortium develops and maintains theTEI Stylesheets, a collection of ready-for-use XSL Transformations scripts that includes a TEI-to-RDF transformation. Despite providing a relatively simple method of extracting RDF statements from TEI documents, the Stylesheets have several shortcomings, particularly when used as a teaching tool. The Stylesheets were not, in fact, designed with a didactic aim in mind and do not offer TEI-to-RDF transformation guidelines: users need to possess good XSLT skills to prepare the TEI document, gain insight into the rationale of the transformation, and adapt it to their specific needs. Also, RDF can be serialized in a variety of ways, with Turtle being by far the most widely used due to its legibility. Since the TEI-to-RDF Stylesheet was created, more powerful methods of linked data production have been released.RDFLib, a Python package for working with RDF, is one of these. The key difference between using XSLT and RDFLib to create RDF triples is that the former requires developers to hardcode RDF triples into the transformation stylesheet (i.e., the developer must choose ahead of time a specific serialization and adhere to its syntax), resulting in a significant loss of flexibility and an increase in human errors. RDFLib, on the other hand, automatically serializes RDF triples, allowing you to add properties to an entity at any point along the way without worrying about syntax and structure (seeexample 3, which shows a comparison between XSLT and RDFLib as two different methods of generating RDF statements). Finally, while the TEI-to-RDF Stylesheet reuse some concepts from theCIDOCConceptual Reference Model (see<a href="#crofts2011">#crofts2011</a>) and theDublin Core(see<a href="#weibel2000">#weibel2000</a>), it does not make use of the expressive potential of ontologies such asFRBRoo(see<a href="#bekiari2015">#bekiari2015</a>) andPRO(see<a href="#peroni2012">#peroni2012</a>), which have recently gained attention and application in both text and cultural heritage representation (see<a href="#daquino2019">#daquino2019</a>).</p>
<p>Another tool we considered isXTriples. XTriples is a webservice-based infrastructure for extracting RDF statements from collections of XML documents<a href="#gruntgens2016">#gruntgens2016</a>. Unlike the Stylesheets, XTriples can produce multiple serializations of the resulting RDF graph and comes with a documentation. The transformation is customizable via an XPath-based configuration file. LOD beginners, however, may find this operation difficult and the tool not immediately usable or replicable.</p>
<p>There are also tools, such asRecogito, that enable the extraction of specific features from TEI-encoded texts. Recogito, developed by the Pelagios Network, allows users to add annotations to specific passages of text, which they can then download as RDF statements (see<a href="#simon2017">#simon2017</a>). The transformation is not configurable nor explained as this is not the focus of the tool.</p>

<p>Based on the shortcomings discussed above, we decided to develop a TEI-to-LOD transformation tool for our students that would simplify the transformation process while also openly and transparently documenting the workflow, with the goal of making such workflow modifiable and adaptable to new contexts. <em>Linked data from TEI</em> (LIFT) is a Python-based, open-source application for creating graphs of RDF statements from TEI documents. LIFT targets digital humanities students as well as textual scholars experimenting for the first times with linked open data in digital scholarly editing. The main component of LIFT is a collection of TEI-to-LOD transformation scripts. The scripts, written in Python, take as input a TEI document and generate an RDF graph. Each script addresses the transformation of specific TEI entities including persons, personal relations, places, and events. A transformation script for the TEI critical apparatus is also available (seeSection 4.2). The application is extensively documented in order to facilitate the reuse and adaptation of the transformation workflow. The documentation walks users through the process of preparing their TEI document for transformation, describes the expected RDF graph, and provides step-by-step explanations of the transformation scripts in the form of an interactive Jupyter notebook (seeSection 4.3).</p>
<p>Users can access LIFT through a browser or download the collection of scripts for local use. A basic understanding of the TEI and RDF is recommended (the ideal target audience are digital humanities students who are already familiar with digital scholarly editions, the TEI, RDF and ontologies, and basic Python programming).</p>
<p>LIFT’s web interface has a straightforward design. When using a browser to access LIFT, users are directed to the homepage, which contains instructions for getting started with the transformation (seeFigure 1): by clicking on the &lsquo;Quick start&rsquo; tab, an upload bar for the input TEI document becomes available (seeFigure 2). After uploading the TEI document into LIFT, users are directed to another page where they can select a transformation option (seeFigure 3). If the transformation is successful, multiple serializations of the resulting RDF graph become available for download (seeFigure 4).</p>
<h2 id="41-methodology">4.1 Methodology</h2>
<p>The creation of linked open data from TEI documents is more than a technical operation. While digital scholarly editions based solely on the TEI standard are document-centric, LOD-based resources are data-centric: the transformation of the information conveyed by the TEI markup into RDF statements forming a graph necessitates careful methodological reflection as the edition is disassembled to form a dataset of interconnected entities, each represented by a URI or a literal.</p>
<p>In addition to reorganizing tree-structured information into a graph data structure, the transition from TEI to linked data necessitates assigning a formal semantics to the entities by reusing existing ontologies whenever possible. As of today, there is no TEI-specific ontology, so all elements and attributes must be mapped to classes and properties from arbitrary ontologies (see<a href="#eide2014">#eide2014</a>and<a href="#ciotti2016">#ciotti2016</a>). There are two major challenges to performing such mapping. First, the chosen ontologies assign a formal semantics to the data, influencing how information is accessed and reused in the future. Users should be aware of the implications of using ready-to-use conversion tools like LIFT: the information conveyed by the original encoding may change when moving from one vocabulary, e.g. the TEI, to another, e.g. FRBRoo, CIDOC CRM, PROV-O, etc. Second, a knowledge graph is composed of entities (i.e. concepts), and links between entities (i.e. relationships between concepts). The distinction between what will become a concept and what will become a relationship is not inconsequential. In TEI, there are at least two ways to represent a relationship. The first approach is to make use of an attribute. The line <code>&lt;rdg wit=&quot;#A&quot;&gt;liber&lt;/rdg&gt;</code> , for example, indicates that the reading &rsquo;liber&rsquo; is witnessed by manuscript &lsquo;A&rsquo;, where &lsquo;is witnessed by&rsquo; is the relationship between the reading and the manuscript. A second method is to nest elements within each another. The encoding <code>&lt;app&gt;&lt;rdg wit=&quot;#A&quot;&gt;liber&lt;/rdg&gt;&lt;rdg wit=&quot;#B&quot;&gt;libellus&lt;/rdg&gt;&lt;/app&gt;</code> , for example, indicates that &rsquo;libellus&rsquo; is a variant of &rsquo;liber&rsquo;. Although interpreting the meaning of the relationships in the preceding examples is simple and without ambiguity, this is not always the case.</p>
<p>When developing LIFT, we decided to set some predefined requirements for the encoding of the input TEI document so to ensure a meaningful, error-free restructuring and formalization of the information (seeSection 4.2). The encoding prerequisites can be adjusted locally by modifying the scripts. As of semantics, we decided to reuse a set of ontologies that are widely adopted in the fields of cultural heritage and text representation: the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM) to represent people, places and events; theAgent Relationship Ontology(AgRelOn) (see<a href="#litz2012">#litz2012</a>) to describe personal relationships; the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records object-oriented (FRBRoo) for texts; the Dublin Core Metadata Terms (DCMI Metadata Terms) to describe bibliographic resources; PROV-O to link the account of an event to its source; the Publishing Roles Ontology (PRO), which enables the reification of roles in such a way that each role is bounded to a specific context (e.g. the role of &lsquo;bride&rsquo; in the context of a particular ceremony); theTime-indexed Value in Context(TVC) (see, again,<a href="#peroni2012">#peroni2012</a>) to represent time; the property owl:sameAs from the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to interconnect the entities to semantically equivalent resources outside the edition; the property rdfs:label and rdf:value from the Resource Description Framework Schema (RDF Schema), which are used to include human-readable labels and TEI snippets in the graph, respectively. Finally, theCritical Apparatus Ontology(CAO) is leveraged to represent critical apparatus entries (see<a href="#giovannetti2021">#giovannetti2021</a>).</p>
<p>A combination of multiple ontologies is required to express the various concepts and relationships underpinning editions, as well as to demonstrate to students how multiple ontologies can be used in the same knowledge graph.</p>
<h2 id="42-the-transformation-scripts">4.2 The transformation scripts</h2>
<p>LIFT’s collection of transformation scripts include:</p>
<p>Persons onlyPersons and eventsPersons and relationsPlaces onlyPersons, events, relations, and placesCritical apparatus</p>
<p>We decided to write multiple scripts because we wanted the transformation to be modular and the resulting RDF graph’s complexity to be incremental. Script 5 combines the previous four into a single transformation option. For the scripts to work, the input TEI document must follow specific guidelines. The TEI, as previously stated, allows for multiple ways to encode the same textual features. For example, in order to markup a personal name, one can use the tag <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> , the tag <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> , or even the tag <code>&lt;rs&gt;</code> (seehttps://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html) This is an important feature in terms of flexibility, but it makes creating a universal TEI-to-RDF transformation script difficult. As a result, LIFT’s documentation includes a set of encoding guidelines intended to ensure a smooth TEI-to-LOD transformation (example 4 belowjuxtaposes the input TEI encoding and the resulting RDF statements). In particular, the input TEI document must conform to the following indications:<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> 1. Any TEI element being transformed must be assigned a unique identifier within an @xml:id attribute; 2. The TEI document must contain a TEI header, even if minimal; the <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> element must be used to describe people in the TEI header, and the <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> element must be used to markup in-text occurrences of such people; 3. In a similar way, the <code>&lt;place&gt;</code> element must be used to describe places in the TEI header, and the <code>&lt;placeName&gt;</code> element must be used to markup in-text occurrences of such places; 4. People and places described in the TEI header should be assigned a <code>@sameAs</code> attribute containing links to external authority records (e.g. VIAF); 5. Any relationship between people should be described in the TEI header within <code>&lt;listRelation&gt;</code> ; 6. Similarly, events should be described using the <code>&lt;event&gt;</code> element within <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;place&gt;</code> . An example input file is also provided when accessing LIFT from the browser. If modifying the TEI encoding to meet the requirements of LIFT is not possible, the documentation in general, and the interactive Jupyter notebook in particular, will help users gain the understanding needed to adapt the transformation to a different input.</p>

LIFT, as stated earlier in the introduction, uses Python as its transformation language. Python, which is increasingly being taught in digital humanities courses around the world, offers more efficient and error-free ways of working with RDF and linked open data than XSLT (seeSection 3 above).</p>
<p>RDFLib is a Python library that specializes in RDF triple creation and management (see the documentation athttps://rdflib.readthedocs.io). Using RDFLib to create RDF triples is very simple, and the amount of human effort required is minimal. URIs can be saved as variables, and RDF statements can be written on separate lines. RDFLib then generates a single graph with no repetitions. Multiple serializations are possible, including XML, Turtle, N-Triples, and JSON-LD.</p>
<p>LIFT uses another Python library, lxml, in conjunction with RDFLib to parse TEI documents (see the documentation athttps://lxml.de). When using XSLT to process XML files, one must be familiar with the structure of the document to be processed. However, using lxml and Python, it is possible to work with less well-known inputs.</p>
<p>example 4 aboveshows a portion of a TEI document and the corresponding RDF graph in LIFT.example 5 belowprovides some components of the transformation script used for generating such output. LIFT searches the TEI document for all occurrences of <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> . The value of the <code>@xml:id</code> attribute associated with the person is then obtained and used to generate the URI representing that person. LIFT looks also for any in-text reference to the person. To do so, it searches the TEI document for all occurrences of <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> featuring a @ref attribute linking to the person. Each person is assigned to the CIDOC CRM class E21 Person. If a <code>@sameAs</code> attribute is provided in the TEI document for the <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> element, LIFT leverages its value or values to create interconnections to external authority records (using the OWL property owl:sameAs). All data used for building the RDF graph are extracted from the TEI document. The content of the <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> element provided within <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> is used to generate a human-readable label for the entity. The language is specified by the <code>@xml:lang</code> attribute. As the reader can see from this example, LIFT uses a predefined set of ontologies to describe the text (seeSection 4.1). In order to modify this behaviour, users must modify the scripts. To facilitate this effort, as already anticipated, LIFT provides a Jupyter notebook that guides users through the scripts step-by-step and interactively (seeSection 4.3).</p>
<h1 id="an-excerpt-of-one-of-lifts-transformation-script-creating-rdf-triples-about-persons">An excerpt of one of LIFT’s transformation script creating RDF triples about persons.</h1>

<h2 id="43-the-documentation">4.3 The documentation</h2>
<p>In developing LIFT as a tool for supporting the adoption of linked open data in digital scholarly editing, we followed the principle that no tool should be used as a black box. Students/users of LIFT must be provided with the knowledge required to understand the methodology and the technology informing the conversion. LIFT is accompanied by an extensive documentation available athttp://linked-data-from-tei.rtfd.io/presenting the full Python-based workflow for TEI-to-LOD transformation. LIFT’s documentation is divided into four main sections:</p>
<p><em>Prepare your TEI document</em> , which explains the encoding requirements for the input TEI document;</p>
<p><em>The RDF graph</em> , illustrating the structure and semantics of the generated knowledge graph by comparing the TEI input with the corresponding RDF output (this section also discusses why and how users might choose different ontologies for their projects or modify the scripts to work with different input data);</p>
<p><em>How the scripts work</em> , where users can access an interactive Jupyter notebook containing LIFT’s scripts with instructions and line-by-line explanations that are meant to help users develop the skills required to write their own transformation scripts;<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Further readings and resources</em> , which lists relevant publications and provides examples of TEI digital scholarly editions which have been enriched by means of linked open data.</p>
<p>In addition to the documentation, each semantic statement of the resulting RDF graph is accompanied by the original TEI construct that generated it facilitating the comparison between the TEI input and the RDF output: this provides users with indirect support as they can view the input TEI encoding and the output RDF graph side by side and go back to adjust the input TEI document to resolve any transformation issues that may arise (seeexample 4 above).</p>
<h2 id="5-lift-in-the-classroom">5. LIFT in the classroom</h2>
<p>Digital humanities, as a discipline, lie at the crossroads of theory and practice. The learning-by-example paradigm, which entails presenting existing models that can be adapted to address new problems, is particularly effective in similar interdisciplinary contexts (see<a href="#tomasi2020">#tomasi2020</a>). LIFT was created in response to a perceived lack of teaching tools for TEI to LOD transformation based on such paradigm.</p>
<p>LIFT will be used in a text representation laboratory activity for the University of Bologna’s Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge. As anticipated at the beginning of this paper, the activity aims to combine the knowledge and skills acquired by the students from various modules and, particularly, text encoding with the TEI, ontology development, Python programming, and linked open data for cultural heritage. The plan for the activity involves gathering the students in 3-member groups. Each group will choose an existing digital scholarly edition and work on the underlying TEI document to ensure that the encoding requirements of LIFT are met.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> The groups will then use LIFT, either via browser or locally, to produce an RDF graph. Finally, each group will present their findings to the class, highlighting challenges and solutions in transforming each type of entity. Following activities will shift the emphasis away from the input TEI document as students will focus on modifying the transformation scripts to adapt them to the existing digital scholarly editions rather than the other way around. By experimenting with the shift from tree-structured to graph-structured data, and from the TEI vocabulary to RDF using multiple ontologies, students will gain a better understanding of the implications of annotating a text in one way versus another within the context of a real-world task that requires them to combine different skills and competencies that are typically taught separately. Furthermore, because the activity is structured as group work on a specific problem to be solved, students will be able to strengthen their ability to collaborate as a team, which is one of the pillars of digital humanities scholarship and, by extension, should be one of digital humanities pedagogy (see<a href="#licastro2020">#licastro2020</a>).</p>
<p>The laboratory activity will also allow us to evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of LIFT as a teaching tool both directly through an end-of-activity questionnaire and indirectly through the students’ presentations.</p>
<h2 id="6-conclusion-and-next-steps">6. Conclusion and next steps</h2>
<p>This paper introduced LIFT, an open-source tool written as a set of Python scripts for generating linked data from TEI-encoded texts. The use of linked open data for text representation facilitates interoperability with other cultural resources on the web and opens up editions to new areas of cultural heritage research. LIFT’s goal is to walk users through the transformation process from TEI to linked data step by step, as well as to promote a better understanding of the theoretical and methodological aspects that underpin the transformation.</p>
<p>Some of the key characteristics of the evolving web of data include open-source tools, well-documented applications, and shared ontologies. User-friendly resources that reduce the complexity of transforming digital scholarly editions from a document-centric to a data-centric model are also critical in the development and expansion of a linked open data cloud of cultural heritage. We envisage LIFT both as a teaching tool and a ready-for-use resource for TEI-to-LOD transformation, hoping it will serve as an example of a digital humanities teaching tool that raises awareness about the methodological and theoretical implications of the structural and semantic shift that occurs when transitioning from a TEI-based text representation to LOD.</p>
<p>With LIFT, we also aim to encourage further research into the development of open-source, user-friendly tools aiding the mutual integration of digital scholarly editions and the cultural heritage linked open data cloud. Such tools have the potential to make digital humanities, and especially knowledge representation, a more inclusive field of study and research. In order to test this idea, we will use LIFT in the context of the University of Bologna’s Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge, as a teaching tool for students encountering linked open data for the first time as a method of publishing digital scholarly editions on the web in a data integration perspective. We expect that LIFT will help students understand the process not only practically but also, and primarily, in terms of methodology and theory.</p>
<p>LIFT is under active development. Features that will be provided in the near future include a transformation script for bibliographic references encoded using specialized elements from theTEImodel.bibLike class. Furthermore, the documentation will be expanded with new sections on ontologies for text representation as well as useful resources, particularly examples of digital scholarly editions enhanced through the use of linked open data.</p>

Introduction<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>Many and diverse scientific communities, including digital textual scholars, have shown increasing interest in semantic web technologies and linked open data (LOD) as a means of knowledge representation since the early 2000s, when Tim Berners-Lee coined the concept of a web of interconnected data rather than simply documents (see <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>). Nonetheless, there is a lack of user-friendly tools for working with digital scholarly editions and LOD.</p>
<p><em>Linked data from TEI</em>  (LIFT) is a Digital Humanities tool for generating linked open data (LOD) from TEI-encoded texts. LIFT, which is accessible at <a href="https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/lift">https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/lift</a>, provides a set of TEI-to-LOD transformation scripts written in Python. The scripts, addressing the transformation of different types of entities to LOD, are thoroughly documented to facilitate their understanding and reuse. The purpose of this paper is to introduce LIFT as a teaching tool for supporting the adoption of linked open data in digital scholarly editing. Our plan is to use LIFT as part of a laboratory activity for the University of Bologna’s Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge, which will combine the knowledge and skills acquired by the students from different modules: text encoding with the TEI, ontology development, Python programming, and linked open data for cultural heritage.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>This paper first provides a brief background on linked open data and their use in digital text representation (see <a href="#background">Section 2</a>). It then goes on to consider related work in the field of TEI to LOD transformation (see <a href="#relatedWork">Section 3</a>) as well as to introduce LIFT from both a technical and methodological perspective (see <a href="#linkedDataFromTeiLift">Section 4</a>). Finally, it discusses the potential application of LIFT in digital humanities learning contexts (see <a href="#LiftInTheClassroom">Section 5</a> and <a href="#conclusionAndNextSteps">Section 6</a>).</p>
<h2 id="2-background">2. Background</h2>
<p>The concept of linked open data refers to a method of publishing structured data – as well as organizing knowledge – on the web in such a way that they can be semantically interlinked to form open clouds of integrated information. As is already well known, LOD are based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF), a graph data model used for making statements about resources. Each RDF statement contains a subject, a predicate, and an object, represented by unique URIs. The subject is the resource being described, the object is either a characteristic of the subject (such as its type) or a resource related to the subject, and the predicate expresses the relationship between the subject and the object (see <a href="#example1">example 1 below</a>). The meaning of RDF data is defined by machine-readable ontologies, formal descriptions of specific concepts within a domain and the relationships holding between them.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>RDF statements can be used to represent information in digital scholarly editions as linked open data.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  To cite just a few examples, the <a href="https://finerollshenry3.org.uk/">Henry III Fine Rolls edition</a> experiments with linked data to express complex relationships between people in historical documents (see <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>). The <a href="https://ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/">Sharing Ancient Wisdoms project</a>, on the other hand, uses linked data to reconstruct text interaction (see <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>), while the <a href="https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/bufalini-notebook">Paolo Bufalini’s Notebook edition</a> uses linked data to represent the interconnections between the various types of fragments – quotations, translations, and annotations – that make up the text (see <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>). Similar information extracted from texts, in addition to administrative, structural, and descriptive metadata, can make a significant contribution to the development of a cultural heritage linked open data cloud: texts do indeed occupy a prominent space in cultural heritage representation. However, in order to reuse and integrate texts into LOD systems, information must first be expressed in RDF according to widely used ontologies in the digital humanities and cultural heritage domains.</p>
<p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), an XML vocabulary for encoding texts in the humanities, is the de facto standard for digital scholarly editing.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  The standard defines terms for representing a wide range of textual entities, including personal names, place names, dates, concepts, and events. Unlike RDF, the TEI has traditionally taken a document-centric approach to representing such entities, with texts processed as ordered hierarchies of content objects nesting neatly one inside the other (see <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>). However, transitioning from a document-centric paradigm to a data-centric paradigm, such as LOD, is not an easy task: converting TEI editions into graphs of RDF statements necessitates a conceptual shift in which texts are no longer viewed as documents but as collections of interconnected entities (see <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The movement beyond TEI towards linked open data began in 2004, when a TEI Special Interest Group on Ontologies was formed with the goal of investigating the feasibility of encoding information about persons, dates, events, places and objects outside the text, in parallel with the steps taken by the Museum community, which was working on the development of CIDOC CRM, an ontological vocabulary for the description of museum collections (see <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>). The new P5 release of the TEI in 2007 introduced new elements for distinguishing real-world entities from their in-text occurrences <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. This change, along with the addition of new attributes that could be used to link an entity to external authority records (see <a href="#example2">example 2 below</a>), made it easier to express relationships between entities in TEI and extract them as RDF statements.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;person</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">sameAs=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;http://viaf.org/viaf/101353608&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>Alexander the Great<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/person&gt;</span> 
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Despite these meaningful developments, there are very few user-friendly tools for working with TEI editions and LOD <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. The fact that the TEI guidelines are not intended to be strictly followed complicates matters: annotators can encode the same textual features in different ways, depending on the project. Because no two texts or editions are identical, this flexibility is required; however, the unavoidable drawback is a certain loss of interoperability (see <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>). Enhancing TEI-encoded texts with linked open data represents a possible way of overcoming this limitation.</p>
<p>Being willing to introduce DHDK students to the extraction of linked open data from TEI-encoded texts, we ran into a lack of user-friendly tools capable of raising awareness about both the methodology and the technology that underpin such operation. LIFT was created to fill this gap.</p>
<h2 id="3-related-work">3. Related work</h2>
<p>As digital humanities practitioners know, XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents. Because the TEI is an XML vocabulary, digital textual scholars have naturally adopted XSLT as their primary transformation language from TEI to other formats including RDF/XML, which is one of the possible serializations of LOD graphs. The TEI Consortium develops and maintains the <a href="https://tei-c.org/tools/stylesheets/">TEI Stylesheets</a>, a collection of ready-for-use XSL Transformations scripts that includes a TEI-to-RDF transformation. Despite providing a relatively simple method of extracting RDF statements from TEI documents, the Stylesheets have several shortcomings, particularly when used as a teaching tool. The Stylesheets were not, in fact, designed with a didactic aim in mind and do not offer TEI-to-RDF transformation guidelines: users need to possess good XSLT skills to prepare the TEI document, gain insight into the rationale of the transformation, and adapt it to their specific needs. Also, RDF can be serialized in a variety of ways, with Turtle being by far the most widely used due to its legibility. Since the TEI-to-RDF Stylesheet was created, more powerful methods of linked data production have been released. <a href="https://rdflib.readthedocs.io">RDFLib</a>, a Python package for working with RDF, is one of these. The key difference between using XSLT and RDFLib to create RDF triples is that the former requires developers to hardcode RDF triples into the transformation stylesheet (i.e., the developer must choose ahead of time a specific serialization and adhere to its syntax), resulting in a significant loss of flexibility and an increase in human errors. RDFLib, on the other hand, automatically serializes RDF triples, allowing you to add properties to an entity at any point along the way without worrying about syntax and structure (see <a href="#example3">example 3</a>, which shows a comparison between XSLT and RDFLib as two different methods of generating RDF statements). Finally, while the TEI-to-RDF Stylesheet reuse some concepts from the <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/">CIDOC</a> Conceptual Reference Model (see <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>) and the <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">Dublin Core</a> (see <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>), it does not make use of the expressive potential of ontologies such as <a href="http://iflastandards.info/ns/fr/frbr/frbroo/">FRBRoo</a> (see <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>) and <a href="http://purl.org/spar/pro/">PRO</a> (see <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>), which have recently gained attention and application in both text and cultural heritage representation (see <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Another tool we considered is <a href="http://xtriples.spatialhumanities.de/">XTriples</a>. XTriples is a webservice-based infrastructure for extracting RDF statements from collections of XML documents <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Unlike the Stylesheets, XTriples can produce multiple serializations of the resulting RDF graph and comes with a documentation. The transformation is customizable via an XPath-based configuration file. LOD beginners, however, may find this operation difficult and the tool not immediately usable or replicable.</p>
<p>There are also tools, such as <a href="https://recogito.pelagios.org/">Recogito</a>, that enable the extraction of specific features from TEI-encoded texts. Recogito, developed by the Pelagios Network, allows users to add annotations to specific passages of text, which they can then download as RDF statements (see <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>). The transformation is not configurable nor explained as this is not the focus of the tool.</p>

<p>Based on the shortcomings discussed above, we decided to develop a TEI-to-LOD transformation tool for our students that would simplify the transformation process while also openly and transparently documenting the workflow, with the goal of making such workflow modifiable and adaptable to new contexts.  <em>Linked data from TEI</em>  (LIFT) is a Python-based, open-source application for creating graphs of RDF statements from TEI documents. LIFT targets digital humanities students as well as textual scholars experimenting for the first times with linked open data in digital scholarly editing. The main component of LIFT is a collection of TEI-to-LOD transformation scripts. The scripts, written in Python, take as input a TEI document and generate an RDF graph. Each script addresses the transformation of specific TEI entities including persons, personal relations, places, and events. A transformation script for the TEI critical apparatus is also available (see <a href="#transformationScripts">Section 4.2</a>). The application is extensively documented in order to facilitate the reuse and adaptation of the transformation workflow. The documentation walks users through the process of preparing their TEI document for transformation, describes the expected RDF graph, and provides step-by-step explanations of the transformation scripts in the form of an interactive Jupyter notebook (see <a href="#documentation">Section 4.3</a>).</p>
<p>Users can access LIFT through a browser or download the collection of scripts for local use. A basic understanding of the TEI and RDF is recommended (the ideal target audience are digital humanities students who are already familiar with digital scholarly editions, the TEI, RDF and ontologies, and basic Python programming).</p>
<p>LIFT’s web interface has a straightforward design. When using a browser to access LIFT, users are directed to the homepage, which contains instructions for getting started with the transformation (see <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>): by clicking on the &lsquo;Quick start&rsquo; tab, an upload bar for the input TEI document becomes available (see <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). After uploading the TEI document into LIFT, users are directed to another page where they can select a transformation option (see <a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>). If the transformation is successful, multiple serializations of the resulting RDF graph become available for download (see <a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>).</p>
<h2 id="41-methodology">4.1 Methodology</h2>
<p>The creation of linked open data from TEI documents is more than a technical operation. While digital scholarly editions based solely on the TEI standard are document-centric, LOD-based resources are data-centric: the transformation of the information conveyed by the TEI markup into RDF statements forming a graph necessitates careful methodological reflection as the edition is disassembled to form a dataset of interconnected entities, each represented by a URI or a literal.</p>
<p>In addition to reorganizing tree-structured information into a graph data structure, the transition from TEI to linked data necessitates assigning a formal semantics to the entities by reusing existing ontologies whenever possible. As of today, there is no TEI-specific ontology, so all elements and attributes must be mapped to classes and properties from arbitrary ontologies (see <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>). There are two major challenges to performing such mapping. First, the chosen ontologies assign a formal semantics to the data, influencing how information is accessed and reused in the future. Users should be aware of the implications of using ready-to-use conversion tools like LIFT: the information conveyed by the original encoding may change when moving from one vocabulary, e.g. the TEI, to another, e.g. FRBRoo, CIDOC CRM, PROV-O, etc. Second, a knowledge graph is composed of entities (i.e. concepts), and links between entities (i.e. relationships between concepts). The distinction between what will become a concept and what will become a relationship is not inconsequential. In TEI, there are at least two ways to represent a relationship. The first approach is to make use of an attribute. The line  <code>&lt;rdg wit=&quot;#A&quot;&gt;liber&lt;/rdg&gt;</code> , for example, indicates that the reading &rsquo;liber&rsquo; is witnessed by manuscript &lsquo;A&rsquo;, where &lsquo;is witnessed by&rsquo; is the relationship between the reading and the manuscript. A second method is to nest elements within each another. The encoding  <code>&lt;app&gt;&lt;rdg wit=&quot;#A&quot;&gt;liber&lt;/rdg&gt;&lt;rdg wit=&quot;#B&quot;&gt;libellus&lt;/rdg&gt;&lt;/app&gt;</code> , for example, indicates that &rsquo;libellus&rsquo; is a variant of &rsquo;liber&rsquo;. Although interpreting the meaning of the relationships in the preceding examples is simple and without ambiguity, this is not always the case.</p>
<p>When developing LIFT, we decided to set some predefined requirements for the encoding of the input TEI document so to ensure a meaningful, error-free restructuring and formalization of the information (see <a href="#transformationScripts">Section 4.2</a>). The encoding prerequisites can be adjusted locally by modifying the scripts. As of semantics, we decided to reuse a set of ontologies that are widely adopted in the fields of cultural heritage and text representation: the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM) to represent people, places and events; the <a href="https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/agrelon">Agent Relationship Ontology</a> (AgRelOn) (see <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>) to describe personal relationships; the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records object-oriented (FRBRoo) for texts; the Dublin Core Metadata Terms (DCMI Metadata Terms) to describe bibliographic resources; PROV-O to link the account of an event to its source; the Publishing Roles Ontology (PRO), which enables the reification of roles in such a way that each role is bounded to a specific context (e.g. the role of &lsquo;bride&rsquo; in the context of a particular ceremony); the <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/2012/04/tvc/">Time-indexed Value in Context</a> (TVC) (see, again, <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>) to represent time; the property owl:sameAs from the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to interconnect the entities to semantically equivalent resources outside the edition; the property rdfs:label and rdf:value from the Resource Description Framework Schema (RDF Schema), which are used to include human-readable labels and TEI snippets in the graph, respectively. Finally, the <a href="https://w3id.org/cao">Critical Apparatus Ontology</a> (CAO) is leveraged to represent critical apparatus entries (see <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>).</p>
<p>A combination of multiple ontologies is required to express the various concepts and relationships underpinning editions, as well as to demonstrate to students how multiple ontologies can be used in the same knowledge graph.</p>
<h2 id="42-the-transformation-scripts">4.2 The transformation scripts</h2>
<p>LIFT’s collection of transformation scripts include:</p>
<p>Persons only  Persons and events  Persons and relations  Places only  Persons, events, relations, and places  Critical apparatus</p>
<p>We decided to write multiple scripts because we wanted the transformation to be modular and the resulting RDF graph’s complexity to be incremental. Script 5 combines the previous four into a single transformation option. For the scripts to work, the input TEI document must follow specific guidelines. The TEI, as previously stated, allows for multiple ways to encode the same textual features. For example, in order to markup a personal name, one can use the tag  <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>  , the tag  <code>&lt;name&gt;</code>  , or even the tag  <code>&lt;rs&gt;</code>  (see <a href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html">https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html</a>) This is an important feature in terms of flexibility, but it makes creating a universal TEI-to-RDF transformation script difficult. As a result, LIFT’s documentation includes a set of encoding guidelines intended to ensure a smooth TEI-to-LOD transformation (<a href="#example4">example 4 below</a> juxtaposes the input TEI encoding and the resulting RDF statements). In particular, the input TEI document must conform to the following indications:<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  1. Any TEI element being transformed must be assigned a unique identifier within an @xml:id attribute; 2. The TEI document must contain a TEI header, even if minimal; the  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  element must be used to describe people in the TEI header, and the  <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>  element must be used to markup in-text occurrences of such people; 3. In a similar way, the  <code>&lt;place&gt;</code>  element must be used to describe places in the TEI header, and the  <code>&lt;placeName&gt;</code>  element must be used to markup in-text occurrences of such places; 4. People and places described in the TEI header should be assigned a  <code>@sameAs</code>  attribute containing links to external authority records (e.g. VIAF); 5. Any relationship between people should be described in the TEI header within  <code>&lt;listRelation&gt;</code>  ; 6. Similarly, events should be described using the  <code>&lt;event&gt;</code>  element within  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  or  <code>&lt;place&gt;</code> . An example input file is also provided when accessing LIFT from the browser. If modifying the TEI encoding to meet the requirements of LIFT is not possible, the documentation in general, and the interactive Jupyter notebook in particular, will help users gain the understanding needed to adapt the transformation to a different input.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>LIFT, as stated earlier in the introduction, uses Python as its transformation language. Python, which is increasingly being taught in digital humanities courses around the world, offers more efficient and error-free ways of working with RDF and linked open data than XSLT (see <a href="#relatedWork">Section 3 above</a>).</p>
<p>RDFLib is a Python library that specializes in RDF triple creation and management (see the documentation at <a href="https://rdflib.readthedocs.io">https://rdflib.readthedocs.io</a>). Using RDFLib to create RDF triples is very simple, and the amount of human effort required is minimal. URIs can be saved as variables, and RDF statements can be written on separate lines. RDFLib then generates a single graph with no repetitions. Multiple serializations are possible, including XML, Turtle, N-Triples, and JSON-LD.</p>
<p>LIFT uses another Python library, lxml, in conjunction with RDFLib to parse TEI documents (see the documentation at <a href="https://lxml.de">https://lxml.de</a>). When using XSLT to process XML files, one must be familiar with the structure of the document to be processed. However, using lxml and Python, it is possible to work with less well-known inputs.</p>
<p><a href="#example4">example 4 above</a> shows a portion of a TEI document and the corresponding RDF graph in LIFT. <a href="#example5">example 5 below</a> provides some components of the transformation script used for generating such output. LIFT searches the TEI document for all occurrences of  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code> . The value of the  <code>@xml:id</code>  attribute associated with the person is then obtained and used to generate the URI representing that person. LIFT looks also for any in-text reference to the person. To do so, it searches the TEI document for all occurrences of  <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>  featuring a @ref attribute linking to the person. Each person is assigned to the CIDOC CRM class E21 Person. If a  <code>@sameAs</code>  attribute is provided in the TEI document for the  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  element, LIFT leverages its value or values to create interconnections to external authority records (using the OWL property owl:sameAs). All data used for building the RDF graph are extracted from the TEI document. The content of the  <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>  element provided within  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  is used to generate a human-readable label for the entity. The language is specified by the  <code>@xml:lang</code>  attribute. As the reader can see from this example, LIFT uses a predefined set of ontologies to describe the text (see <a href="#methodology">Section 4.1</a>). In order to modify this behaviour, users must modify the scripts. To facilitate this effort, as already anticipated, LIFT provides a Jupyter notebook that guides users through the scripts step-by-step and interactively (see <a href="#documentation">Section 4.3</a> ).</p>

<p>In developing LIFT as a tool for supporting the adoption of linked open data in digital scholarly editing, we followed the principle that no tool should be used as a black box. Students/users of LIFT must be provided with the knowledge required to understand the methodology and the technology informing the conversion. LIFT is accompanied by an extensive documentation available at <a href="http://linked-data-from-tei.rtfd.io/">http://linked-data-from-tei.rtfd.io/</a> presenting the full Python-based workflow for TEI-to-LOD transformation. LIFT’s documentation is divided into four main sections:</p>
<p><em>Prepare your TEI document</em> , which explains the encoding requirements for the input TEI document;</p>
<p><em>The RDF graph</em> , illustrating the structure and semantics of the generated knowledge graph by comparing the TEI input with the corresponding RDF output (this section also discusses why and how users might choose different ontologies for their projects or modify the scripts to work with different input data);</p>
<p><em>How the scripts work</em> , where users can access an interactive Jupyter notebook containing LIFT’s scripts with instructions and line-by-line explanations that are meant to help users develop the skills required to write their own transformation scripts;<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Further readings and resources</em> , which lists relevant publications and provides examples of TEI digital scholarly editions which have been enriched by means of linked open data.</p>
<p>In addition to the documentation, each semantic statement of the resulting RDF graph is accompanied by the original TEI construct that generated it facilitating the comparison between the TEI input and the RDF output: this provides users with indirect support as they can view the input TEI encoding and the output RDF graph side by side and go back to adjust the input TEI document to resolve any transformation issues that may arise (see <a href="#example4">example 4 above</a>).</p>
<h2 id="5-lift-in-the-classroom">5. LIFT in the classroom</h2>
<p>Digital humanities, as a discipline, lie at the crossroads of theory and practice. The learning-by-example paradigm, which entails presenting existing models that can be adapted to address new problems, is particularly effective in similar interdisciplinary contexts (see <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>). LIFT was created in response to a perceived lack of teaching tools for TEI to LOD transformation based on such paradigm.</p>
<p>LIFT will be used in a text representation laboratory activity for the University of Bologna’s Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge. As anticipated at the beginning of this paper, the activity aims to combine the knowledge and skills acquired by the students from various modules and, particularly, text encoding with the TEI, ontology development, Python programming, and linked open data for cultural heritage. The plan for the activity involves gathering the students in 3-member groups. Each group will choose an existing digital scholarly edition and work on the underlying TEI document to ensure that the encoding requirements of LIFT are met.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  The groups will then use LIFT, either via browser or locally, to produce an RDF graph. Finally, each group will present their findings to the class, highlighting challenges and solutions in transforming each type of entity. Following activities will shift the emphasis away from the input TEI document as students will focus on modifying the transformation scripts to adapt them to the existing digital scholarly editions rather than the other way around. By experimenting with the shift from tree-structured to graph-structured data, and from the TEI vocabulary to RDF using multiple ontologies, students will gain a better understanding of the implications of annotating a text in one way versus another within the context of a real-world task that requires them to combine different skills and competencies that are typically taught separately. Furthermore, because the activity is structured as group work on a specific problem to be solved, students will be able to strengthen their ability to collaborate as a team, which is one of the pillars of digital humanities scholarship and, by extension, should be one of digital humanities pedagogy (see <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The laboratory activity will also allow us to evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of LIFT as a teaching tool both directly through an end-of-activity questionnaire and indirectly through the students’ presentations.</p>
<h2 id="6-conclusion-and-next-steps">6. Conclusion and next steps</h2>
<p>This paper introduced LIFT, an open-source tool written as a set of Python scripts for generating linked data from TEI-encoded texts. The use of linked open data for text representation facilitates interoperability with other cultural resources on the web and opens up editions to new areas of cultural heritage research. LIFT’s goal is to walk users through the transformation process from TEI to linked data step by step, as well as to promote a better understanding of the theoretical and methodological aspects that underpin the transformation.</p>
<p>Some of the key characteristics of the evolving web of data include open-source tools, well-documented applications, and shared ontologies. User-friendly resources that reduce the complexity of transforming digital scholarly editions from a document-centric to a data-centric model are also critical in the development and expansion of a linked open data cloud of cultural heritage. We envisage LIFT both as a teaching tool and a ready-for-use resource for TEI-to-LOD transformation, hoping it will serve as an example of a digital humanities teaching tool that raises awareness about the methodological and theoretical implications of the structural and semantic shift that occurs when transitioning from a TEI-based text representation to LOD.</p>
<p>With LIFT, we also aim to encourage further research into the development of open-source, user-friendly tools aiding the mutual integration of digital scholarly editions and the cultural heritage linked open data cloud. Such tools have the potential to make digital humanities, and especially knowledge representation, a more inclusive field of study and research. In order to test this idea, we will use LIFT in the context of the University of Bologna’s Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge, as a teaching tool for students encountering linked open data for the first time as a method of publishing digital scholarly editions on the web in a data integration perspective. We expect that LIFT will help students understand the process not only practically but also, and primarily, in terms of methodology and theory.</p>
<p>LIFT is under active development. Features that will be provided in the near future include a transformation script for bibliographic references encoded using specialized elements from the <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#COBI">TEI</a> model.bibLike class. Furthermore, the documentation will be expanded with new sections on ontologies for text representation as well as useful resources, particularly examples of digital scholarly editions enhanced through the use of linked open data.</p>

When digital humanities tools are applied to cultural artifacts, sociofacts and mentifacts, a digital cultural record may be produced. Post-colonial digital humanities (PDH) pushes the envelope by interrogating the &lsquo;human&rsquo; in digital humanities. PDH approaches the digital cultural record by way of a hermeneutic of suspicion, recognizing that there exists no suppositionless position from which to engage DH. Concretely, PDH rests on the premise that, in creating the first analog cultural records, colonial authorities chose to advance colonial interests whenever such interests bifurcated from those of the colonized. When such analog records are eventually digitized, inherent imperfections simply migrate into the digital domain.</p>
<p>In  <em>New Digital Worlds</em> , Roopika Risam takes the position that such migration of imperfections precipitates the disruptions that subsist within the digital cultural record. PDH, consequently, aims to uncover and intervene in disruptions produced by colonialism and neocolonialism. It tackles the shadows cast by the hermeneutical position of the colonizers who created cultural records for the colonized.</p>
<p>The digital cultural record, as a by-product of historical research work, naturally inherits all the riddles emanating from the historical method. For instance, the word history means &lsquo;what happened in the past&rsquo;, but it also means &rsquo;the study of what happened in the past&rsquo;. Historians often make a distinction between  <em>histories from above</em>   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and  <em>histories from below</em>   <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>   <em>. Histories from Above</em>  dwell upon the big books, the big concepts, the big institutions, the big thinkers, the big events and the so-called golden ages.  <em>Histories from Below</em> , on the other hand, account for historical events from the perspective of ordinary people rather than leaders – emphasizing the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the non-conformists, and other marginal groups.</p>
<p>In light of those two broad approaches to history, questions immediately arise regarding the production of the digital cultural record. PDH embraces  <em>history from below</em> , while accusing colonial authorities of embracing history from above. Throughout the book, Risam maintains the need to checkmate the potential and actual violence that colonized peoples have endured because of the existence of uncritiqued cultural records, whether analog or digital, coming from above. Risam gives several reasons why such interventions are necessary.</p>
<p>To begin with, the uncritiqued digital cultural record has consequences for people’s lives. Risam cites an example from Puerto Rico. Following the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017, it was found that existing digital maps (created by digitizing colonial analog maps) were insufficient to support relief efforts. People suffered and died as relief agencies faced difficulties in navigating the devastated island. The Mapathon project, a PDH endeavor, helped fill the  “gaps and omissions”   <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> subsisting in the initial maps. Updated maps produced by the Mapathon project helped to render relief efforts more efficient, thereby saving hundreds of lives.</p>
<p>In addition, re-evaluating the cultural record will help to checkmate the epistemic violence which animated its initial production. Ontological categories do not typically translate properly from one culture to another. Consequently, the colonial endeavour to articulate universal claims generally meets with deep-seated conceptual stumbling blocks. Colonizing empires often created justifying narratives by resorting to making caricatures of peoples, things, and mores that do not fit snugly into the colonial mindset. Evidence of such caricatures abound in historical records: records which end up getting digitized. A lot of psychic damage occurs when such records are employed in education, as colonized youths find themselves at the receiving end of a pedagogy designed for mockery. Timely interventions by PDH will go a long way in correcting those anomalies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, carefully crafted PDH projects will help to stem the tide of widespread misrepresentation – one of the consequences of broadcasting widespread caricatures. Nowadays, millions of people get their information from digital media. Inundating digital media with negatively-biased cultural records exponentially multiplies opportunities for misrepresentation, naturally leading to pervasive misunderstanding and a breakdown in communication. A cascade of errors ensues, first leading to a devaluing of Black and indigenous lives, then to the defunding of African-American, Americana, Black, and Ethnic studies, as witnessed in a number of universities in the West <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Another reason to embrace PDH is to further enhance knowledge from the margins, an emphasis of history from below. A famous African thinker once said that until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. By choosing to lend a voice to the historically-disadvantaged  _digital _ Dalits and subalterns <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, Risam hopes to explore the unexamined questions of power, globalization, and colonial ideologies (emanating from the global north) that have shaped the digital cultural record. By choosing to hear from the kings, queens, peasants, and outcasts of history, the author hopes to produce a richer encoding of the past as embodied in the digital cultural record.</p>
<p>Going further, PDH intends to pay attention to decolonial computing, which calls for renewed attention to critical race theory within technocultures <sup id="fnref3:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. After much practice and rumination, data scientists eventually learn than data is not information, information is not knowledge, knowledge is not understanding, understanding is not wisdom. Decolonial computing is about interrogating who is doing computing, where they are doing it, and, thereby, what computing means both epistemologically and ontologically. PDH questions the hitherto presumed political and ethical neutrality of computing techniques. Myriad questions about the objectivity of technical methods are re-examined in new light.</p>
<p>This book is recommended for scholars that recognize the utmost importance of critical historiography, while intending to expand the frontiers of digital humanities. Risam walks the talk through a comprehensive listing of named PDH projects which take  <em>history from below</em>  seriously. Risam’s unusual decision to examine the conceptual frameworks that animate the design of computing systems remains a good example of dialectical engagement animated by a philosophical spirit. The products of PDH research work will make tacit knowledge explicit, shed light upon hermeneutical blind spots, and shake up existing digital humanities pedagogy. The new approaches proposed will go a long way in answering many old, lingering questions.</p>

<p>In March 2020, the DARIAH ERIC, a pan-European research infrastructure for the arts and humanities, was deeply engaged in the planning for their May annual event, but this annual event had to be postponed and ultimately moved online due to the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic. For DARIAH, however, we did not want to lose the opportunity to share knowledge and exchange ideas in our usual vibrant format. Our position within digital humanities and the meta-relation to our chosen event theme of  “Scholarly Primitives”  made us hyperaware that virtual interactions were impoverished and lacking. However, there was little investigation of exactly what functions could be easily transposed into the virtual format and which ones could not. This event, which we referred to not as a conference but as a Virtual Exchange (VX) event, would seek to maximise audience engagement and interaction, minimise participant cognitive load, foster serendipity and discovery, and specifically explore the human side of what happens at in-person versus online scholarly meetings. This field report details how the DARIAH VX team theorised, built, lived and evaluated the strengths of the virtual scholarly meeting through the contextual lens of  “Scholarly Primitives”  and how future online events could learn from and apply these strategies and specific practices.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In March 2020, the DARIAH ERIC, a pan-European research infrastructure for the arts and humanities, was deeply engaged in the planning for their May annual event, putting final touches on its three-day schedule of papers, panels, posters and meetings featuring reflections on the twentieth anniversary of the publication of John Unsworth’s seminal paper on the  “Scholarly Primitives”  of humanities research. And then, suddenly, we weren’t.</p>
<p>Like so many other events in 2020, the DARIAH Annual Event had to be postponed and ultimately moved online due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. For DARIAH, however, the difficult process of coming to terms with losing our opportunity to share knowledge and exchange ideas in our usual vibrant format was accompanied by two strong resonances. First of all, as a distributed organisation, the DARIAH community was somewhat ahead of the curve in terms of moving to online meetings. While the rest of the world seemed to be just discovering the joys of Zoom fatigue and that seminal cri de coeur of the virtual meeting please mute your mic, DARIAH was already a heavy user of this platform since 2016, and had developed a robust calendar balancing virtual and face-to-face interactions for its core and peripheral team members so as to maximise the utility of each mode of interaction. Watching the transformation of professional interaction from our position of relative experience with virtual work made us uniquely sensitive to the manner in which the blunt instrument of videoconferencing was suddenly needing to be applied to nearly every human interaction, many of which had not been imagined as use cases when the tools were designed. We were finding ourselves in a period of the  “virtual incunabular”  (drawing on the idea developed in <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of the digital incunabula) where the usage of a new knowledge technology was being applied according to the norms and affordances of an older one, and not always with fully satisfactory results, a model alternatively referred to by <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> as the online insert model.</p>
<p>We were inspired not only by our observations of the incunabular, however, but also by our sensitivity, honed by our engagement with the digital humanities, to the research and exchange processes that our chosen event theme of  “Scholarly Primitives”  had made us so aware of. It was an accepted truism that virtual interactions were impoverished and lacking, but there was very little investigation of exactly what was missing and, as a corollary, what functions could be easily transposed to the virtual format, and what ones could not. Rather than merely accept or ignore these simplistic insights, we decided instead to approach this question of efficient scholarly communications as a research challenge, to be framed by the research question how one might apply the concept of scholarly primitives to our communal, social knowledge-creating and -sharing processes, breaking down the functions of the scholarly meeting in the same way that Unsworth had with research processes. Our central argument was that through such an application of canonical DH theory we could better understand a different, but not unrelated, subset of our research practices within the digital humanities, as well as develop widely transferable insight regarding the tactical use of virtual interactions that might transcend the virtual incunabular. Had we not been long aware already of the fact that we should be reconsidering our modes of interaction within the research ecosystem in the light of climate change anyway, the late 2019/early 2020 rush of opinion pieces questioning academic conferences would have certainly brought this to our minds (see for example <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>), and, as these commentators also emphasised, COVID-19 was our sudden and unwelcome, yet undeniably still fertile, opportunity to participate in a grand experiment.</p>
<p>The experiment this positionality inspired us to undertake was centred on the need to pivot our development of the physical event planned for May to a virtual one, but this virtual event would seek to harness different interaction paradigms from those we had thus far been considering. To do this we would draw from scholarship on scholarly interaction and knowledge exchange, on carbon neutral conferencing, but also pedagogical paradigms and the methodologies of  “critical making”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. With this event, which we eventually came to refer to not as a conference but as a Virtual Exchange (VX) event, we would seek to maximise audience engagement and interaction, minimise participant cognitive load, foster serendipity and discovery, and deeply explore the human side of what happens at scholarly meetings. What follows is an account of how the DARIAH VX team theorised, built, lived and evaluated this attempt to play to the strengths of the virtual scholarly meeting, and the lessons we learned in the process.</p>
<h2 id="informing-a-novel-approach-to-scholarly-meetings-primitives-ncn-events-and-beyond">Informing a novel approach to scholarly meetings: Primitives, NCN Events and beyond.</h2>
<p>In 2000, John Unsworth presented a tentative list of scholarly primitives, described as  “basic functions common to scholarly activity across disciplines, over time, and independent of theoretical orientation”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. The immediate intention underlying Unsworth’s explication of scholarly primitives was to suggest some (recursive) functions of humanities scholarship that might be usefully embodied in tool-building in humanities computing. Unsworth’s list comprised seven discrete functions — discovering, annotating, comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating and representing — with Unsworth further noting that  “referring”  and  “referencing”  are the two true primitives, as they are in some way related to all of the others.</p>
<p>In an interview conducted in 2011, Unsworth reiterated the point that his list of scholarly primitives was not intended to be exhaustive. Rather, in his initial contribution he welcomed and encouraged debate on the subject. Indeed, Unsworth’s approach of using scholarly primitives as a means of understanding humanities’ research processes and building digital tools for scholarship in the humanities has been, and continues to be, the subject of much discussion within the fields of Digital Humanities and Information Sciences. The following sample of that body of literature gives an overview of these trends.</p>
<p>In a 2009 report on the state of knowledge of scholarly information behaviour compiled for the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), Carole Palmer and her co-authors presented an adapted definition of Unsworth&rsquo;s concept of a primitive  “by emphasizing a sense of the primitive as something at the base or beginning of a larger process” . This amended definition was closely related to the authors’ concept of scholarly information activities which emphasised  “the explicit role of information in the conduct of research and production of scholarship”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Palmer et al. derived a framework of five core scholarly activities — searching, collecting, reading, writing and collaborating — with two or more primitives identified within these broader categories. Similar to the  “true primitives”  of Unsworth’s model, the authors also distinguish four cross-cutting primitives that are related to at least two individual scholarly activities. <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The following year, the US-based Project Bamboo (2008-2012), a cyberinfrastructure initiative for the arts and humanities, published the findings of a series of workshops held in 2008 with an international cohort of digital humanities practitioners with the aim of charting  “a direction for cyberinfrastructure development in the humanities”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. This report identifies thirteen themes of scholarly practice and the authors of the report map the Bamboo themes to Unsworth’s scholarly primitives and Palmer et al.’s scholarly information activities <sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. In 2014, Annie Murray and Jared Wiercinski further developed this body of research by supplementing it to better reflect the specific activities of humanities scholars who work with audio formats <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Moreover, Murray and Wiercinski recommend familiarity with the work of Unsworth, Palmer and Project Bamboo as the foundation for an evidence-based design methodology for building digital tools for humanities scholars.</p>
<p>Unsworth’s Scholarly Primitives had been highly influential in the context of DARIAH. During DARIAH’s preparatory phase, Sheila Anderson et al. combined the related concepts of methodological commons and primitives  “to map research work in arts and humanities e-Science, and to assist in scoping the research infrastructure for the European project DARIAH”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Lastly, in the context of this brief review of the literature on scholarly primitives that informed and inspired the DARIAH VX, the Scholarly Domain Model (SDM) proposed by the Digitised Manuscript to Europeana (DM2E) project proposed to bridge the  “practices of humanist research approaches in both the analogue and digital world”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. The SDM, which consists of four  “different layers of abstraction”  — Areas, Scholarly Primitives, Scholarly Activities and Scholarly Operations — was based on the assumption that an understanding of Unsworth’s Scholarly Primitives is fundamental to any model of the scholarly domain <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This long tradition of discourse and practice in the theory and application of scholarly primitives did not necessarily prepare the DARIAH group (later to become the VX Event Programme Committee, the authors of this paper) to intentionally apply these frameworks in the specific context of scholarly meetings, however. Our first exercise as a group, therefore, was to try to translate the various components of a typical scholarly meeting into their functions (the results of which are summarised in Table 1).<br>
DARIAH VX Preliminary List of Scholarly Activities and Primitives in Meetings    Component  Presumed or possible function(s)      Papers, roundtables, keynotes  Knowledge sharing, verification and certification      Poster sessions, networking events, hallway chats, coffee breaks  Semi-structured and serendipitous individual or small group interactions        Social listening, common experiences, registration, name badges, buffet dinners, letting hair down with professional peers  Shared Experiences for community identity building      Workshops, sidebar meetings  Collaborative work and learning   <br>
These results were in some ways not surprising: for example, some elements of a scholarly meeting would inevitably map on to the traditional mechanisms for formal scholarly communications (i.e. the registration, dissemination, certification and archiving functions of scholarly publishing) (c.f. <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>, as cited in <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>). Other aspects seemed to recognise that for the digital humanities at least, the shifting of traditional practices of sole authorship and single scholarship to more collaborative modes of knowledge co-creation <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, were driving the scholarly exchange space to be ever more an opportunity to also meet specific milestones for the work of subgroups attending. Perhaps most interesting in the light of later findings, however, was the large amount of space and time we could identify at events that was dedicated to the development of informal networks and social capital. This of course represents trends in the wider scholarly communications ecosystem, but also a certain irony, given that the rise of printed periodicals in the late 17th century was driven in large part as mechanism by which to preserve ephemeral fragments of knowledge that tended to disappear after the informal exchanges from which they originated <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We were able to apply two further measures to attempt to check any unconscious biases we might be inadvertently allowing overt influence over the event we would design, namely a wider literature review and an effort to crowdsource further input for our model from our event itself. To deliver on the first of these, we sought out existing adjacent research literature to inform our activities, in particular work on Nearly Carbon Neutral (NCN) professional meetings was of great relevance for the questions it had been asking about how and why we might meet in the future, albeit from a perspective driven by environmental sustainability, rather than a global pandemic. Given its connections to the DH community, of special interest were the set of pre-publication blog posts and releases for the collection  <em>Right Research: Modelling Sustainable Research Practices in the Anthropocene</em>   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. In particular the taxonomy of presences developed there, highlighting social, cognitive and leadership presences, as well as the space where research agendae can be negotiated <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> provided the DARIAH VX team with a perspective on the values of the scholarly meeting that organised similar observations to our own according to a different organising principle.</p>
<p>Clancy <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> provides an excellent review of research across a number of fields into the question of whether conferences facilitate collaboration. In spite what one might see as a relatively narrow, STEM specific conceit underlying the studies he cites (the measure of collaboration being a shared publication or funding application within a relatively limited period of time) the results did still provide a resounding confirmation of the vibrancy of interactions as a facilitator for knowledge consolidation, with one study <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> demonstrating that being in a randomly assigned discussion room increased the probability of submitting a joint grant proposal by 75%. On the other hand, as the author concluded, these studies all focussed on face-to-face interaction itself, not in comparison with virtual alternatives.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that our conceptualisation of the virtual scholarly meeting from the ground up led us to very different conclusions from some of the existing literature. Two particular points of departure were the benefits of asynchronicity as proposed by <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> and the capacity for virtual meetings to be more inclusive (a benefit cited by <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>). On the former issue, while of course making materials available in multiple formats provides some benefits, our analysis of the social and intellectual processes involved in a scholarly meeting led us to believe that it was precisely the informality and ephemerality of many of these engagements that delivered the most value, and that enhancing their formal aspects might achieve a different aim, but not perhaps the most crucial ones of supporting openness and disruptive thinking and interaction. On the second issue, while we would agree that anything that increases access to knowledge for marginalised groups is a benefit, we saw strong threats possible that the virtual could lower barriers in some ways only to raise them in others. This could bring not only the impact of technical digital divides and time zones more to the fore, but of course also make it more difficult to hear voices, such as those of early career researchers, that might not come in to such a meeting already confident or empowered. It could perhaps also perpetuate assumptions that just because someone  <em>can</em>  log in to a meeting from their home means that they  <em>will</em>  be afforded the time and space they need to truly participate.</p>
<p>The unprecedented times made us aware of a need to gather perspectives specific to the current moment as well, however. We therefore decided that, in the spirit of inclusivity and engagement we wanted to place at the heart of the DARIAH VX event, we would also solicit input from participants at the point of registration as to what they felt the latent and manifest purposes of scholarly meetings were, and what place these events held for them in the landscape of inputs and opportunities they might have for personal and professional development. In the registration form, we included two sets of questions. The first question asked:  “Please give us up to three of your most important reasons for attending meetings with other researchers.”  We also asked, for each example, whether the person felt that a given primitive was better served by the analogue context, the virtual context, or both. The second information request was more open, and designed to explore the anecdotal and emotional weight of scholarly meetings:  “Please share with us your strongest memory of a scholarly meeting (positive or negative)” .</p>
<p>Ultimately, 85 people registered for the event and filled in this information, from which we then extracted and aligned key terms with each other (as we had not controlled the participant’s vocabulary) and with our enriched internally defined set of functions. While the crowdsourced responses to the first question did not contradict the initial framework, they did enrich it greatly, and brought out a couple of key nuances, in particular the very strong weight given to the informal, open-ended aspects of the interaction meetings enabled and fact that these people processes were perceived to be far less well-served in the virtual environment than those that supported the circulation of ideas. These responses were distilled into the following visualisation in Figure 1.</p>

<p>What perhaps is more interesting and surprising for its intensity, if not its content per se, was the overwhelming preponderance of strongly positive accounts given in the personal anecdotes. With one exception, all of the responses to this question related not just positive experiences, but very strongly positive ones, deeply personal and often life-changing. An extract of some of the common terms appearing in this corpus is as follows in Table 2.<br>
Emotional Vocabulary of Scholarly Meetings, Extracted from Participant Anecdotes    Inspiration, Productive, Passion, Creativity, Liberating departure from the norm, Different contexts coming together, Taking risks, Discovery, Unique ideas, Contacts made, Connections solidified, Still vivid, Conversations through the night, Lasting impact, Curiosity and motivation, Feel part of a community, Share, Delighted, Supportive, Friends smiling, Warmth, Glad to be valued, Recognised, Positive experience      Changed my attitude, Changed my life   <br>
This led us to conclude that while the manifest purpose of scholarly meetings might well be achieved in a number of ways, the latent purpose of building careers, friendships and professional identities was not only present, but exceptionally strong.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-virtual-exchange-event">Creating the Virtual Exchange Event</h2>
<p>We decided upon a suite of seven tactics that we felt would have the most impact on making the event both informative but also different, in the sense of the idea of paradigmatic regression developed by Joris van Zundert <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, questioning preconceived notions in the attempt to achieve something different. These tactics were as follows:</p>
<p>A pre-workshop virtual exhibition to allow participants to settle in to the cognitive space  Use of plenaries to establish a common set of themes, informal tone, build community and instill certain social norms  Incorporation of crowdsourced insight from registration into the event, including professional assessments and personal anecdotes  Emphasis on breakout session discussions  Embed a contrasting, but complementary, arts research perspective  Keeping technologies deployed few and simple  Rich and open communication before the event and documentation afterward</p>
<p>This set of guiding principles and the instruments that delivered them mapped onto our refined set of primitives we wanted to address as per Table 3, which are discussed in more detail below.<br>
Mapping Primitives to Event Activities    Primitive or transversal  Our Response      A. Management of the constraints: transparent technology, ‘channelled’ distraction  Small number of commonly used, well-tested tools, well prepared and socially supported implementation, strong ‘narrative’      B. Community identity building and sharing of experiences, embodied and situated learning  Sharing of stories, ‘crowdsourced’ plenary, unique format and informal tone, artistic reflection, opening breathing exercise, Embedded ‘Liveness’ project      C. Serendipitous discovery, making (new, contextualised) connections between ideas and people  Break out session format and interactions, exhibition, encouragement to network      D. Semi-formal knowledge sharing: presenting, learning, feedback  Plenary, approach to documentation (recordings, notes, capture, reports), pre-event questionnaire, post-event survey</p>
<h2 id="a-managing-the-technologies-and-data-before-during-and-after-the-event">A. Managing the technologies and data: before, during and after the event</h2>
<p>Mapping the above considerations about the scholarly primitives of online events into the practicalities of setting the virtual stage for the synchronous event also entailed making informed choices about the technology we relied on. The enormous impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on IT infrastructures and especially on online meeting services (see e.g. <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>) made the ethical complexities inherent in their use, acquisition and development, together with how exposed we were to them (see e.g. discussed in <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>) even more malleable. Although many of us would have preferred an open source alternative (particularly given some of Zoom’s privacy issues, see <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>), we had to prioritise three core criteria at short notice: reliable performance, rich functionality, and the degree of familiarity of DARIAH communities with the tools in question. We also wanted to ensure we followed best practices shared in our broader communities, such as the experiences of the COPIM team with moving events online and setting up breakout rooms the smoothest possible way <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To keep a delicate balance between giving to our audience the richest possible experience vs. avoiding cognitive overload in online meetings and learning environments (see e.g. <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>), we decided not to involve external tools (e.g. Mentimeter, Miro, Mural etc.) but put the emphasis on maximizing the potentials of Zoom (e.g. via using break out rooms, facilitating exchange in different chat rooms, enabling the audience to share content etc.) instead to facilitate serendipitous discussions of different sorts between and across speakers, breakout chairs and the members of the audience. In doing so, the help of technical facilitators was required. These support roles, forming human bridges between the technical and people, included a technical coordinator who was responsible for the overall smooth running of the online event (setting up and tailoring the virtual environment to our needs, testing, managing different contributor roles and enabling content sharing, setting up the break out rooms and assigning people to them, supporting members of the audience with connection problems or getting lost in the virtual spaces) and technical facilitators (members of the DARIAH Central Office) in each breakout room. They made sure that everyone arrived and felt comfortable in their breakout rooms and also provided help with note taking (using the one additional tool we did allow ourselves, Google documents).</p>
<p>DARIAH’s well-established routine of conducting virtual scholarly meetings as well as the best practices we incorporated in our technical set-up enabled the smooth running of the synchronous event. However, the following three specificities of online events are noteworthy for organizers of future events. Firstly, we saw a significant difference between the number of registrations to the event (with breakout room pre-assignments) versus the actual participants. Although, a discrepancy in registrations and actual online participation is common, it was a challenge to assign the sufficient number of participants to all the seven breakout rooms. Secondly, enabling small-group interactions in itself does not break down academic hierarchy. We observed that not all the attendees felt comfortable joining the discussions in smaller breakout room settings, even with the encouraging and sensible contributions of the breakout chairs. Thirdly, for these sessions to work well, they need to be well staffed, and those contributors need to be well briefed on their specific roles.</p>
<h2 id="b-structuring-the-synchronous-event-for-community-building">B. Structuring the synchronous event for community building</h2>
<p>Although the preparation phase for this event was given particular attention, we did not feel that any more than a two-hour event would be productive: one of the greatest misunderstandings of the early days of day-long face-to-face meetings being taken virtual was the assumption that an eight hour session in a room could simply be replaced by a similar day of work online. Even within this limited window, we felt that a variety of interaction types would be needed, each no longer than 30 minutes. We therefore ultimately decided on a structure composed of 1) an opening plenary; 2) breakout sessions; 3) a short break followed by a presentation on presence and connection informed by a piece of performing arts research we would commission; and 4) a closing plenary to share the results of the breakout groups and wrap up the event. In each of these sessions, we were mindful of what we wanted both the meeting and and the virtual medium to achieve, with the results as follows.</p>
<h2 id="opening-and-closing-plenaries">Opening and closing plenaries</h2>
<p>Given the goal of the meeting to draw people together into a sense of having experienced something communal, we felt that we would not be able to avoid an opening plenary. The risk of this strategy, however, was that people would fall too easily into the habits of large virtual meetings, (over)stretching their cognitive capacities in a state that technology consultant, Linda Stone, has named  “Continuous Partial Attention”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. We therefore deployed a number of specific measures within this block in order to maintain not just shreds of attention, but engagement with the ideas and topics we were hoping to focus on.</p>
<p>Firstly, we considered the impact that recording the event may have on the comfort level of participants to exchange semi-formally. The plenaries were the only sessions we recorded, in spite of our desire to have as full a record as possible of the event. Ultimately, we decided that having the comprehensive record that technology  <em>could</em>  give us should not be allowed to exercise a potential chilling effect or over-formality on what the participants  <em>would</em>  give us, particularly in the breakout sessions. In-person conference exchanges are not traced and documented, and the DARIAH VX Event aimed to promote the freedom of the ephemeral.</p>
<p>Secondly, the plenary moderator (DARIAH Director, Jennifer Edmond) asked all of the participants to pause before the start of the session to take three breaths with her. The idea of using this technique to open the programme was suggested by the arts researcher on the programme committee, Courtney Grile, as a way to bring an element of the shared physical grounding of the face-to-face meeting — the tang of a particular floor cleaner, the waft of an urn of coffee outside the door, the humidity on a rainy day, the shadows through the windows on a sunny day — that we lose in virtual spaces. Breath is a powerful centre point for creating a communal experience, but also had a signalling function for us, indicating that it was our intention to deliver an event that did not abide by the established heuristics by which scholars generally navigate their meetings.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we laid the desired foundation for how we wanted people to participate. Some of these were simple and general aspects of good virtual behaviour: mute your microphone, turn off notifications to the extent you can, try to keep your attention on the topic, if not on the presentation, be kind, be generous, be empathetic. But we also used this phase to encourage what could have been seen as a new social norm with a rule-breaking role, namely that we encouraged the virtual version of chatting in the back of the plenary room. We drew attention to the participants list and the chat window, and explicitly encouraged people to take advantage of whatever back channels they were comfortable with to reach out to fellow participants they knew. For people who might be new to the community, we explicitly invited them to make contact with one of three programme committee members (the authors of this paper) whose role in that session was specifically to be available for questions and informal conversation. The rationale for this encouragement to not to pay attention to the plenary was twofold: first, full attention was unlikely anyway but second, we wanted to try to emulate the experience of what we referred to as shared social listening, that communal experience of not just hearing the same words and processing the same ideas at the same time, but of also weaving those words and ideas into our own neural and social networks, the intellectual and relational components of our professional identities.</p>
<p>After these preliminaries, we moved to the opening plenary presentation of what we wanted the event to achieve and what inspirations underpinned it. In this session as well, however, the emphasis was on the communal experience of knowledge creation, balancing aspects of our formal secondary literature review with the insights from the registration process, described above. This attempt to keep the focus on the knowledge of the group assembled, rather than of the programme committee or of a small group of individuals was continued in the closing plenary as well, which moved through four stepping stones chosen to bring a sense of closure to the group and the experience.</p>
<p>The closing included an efficient, open and thought-provoking reporting format from the breakout discussions (see a description of this below); a reveal of how our event had been conceptualised to meet the needs the collected input led us to focus on; a brief report drawn from expert input on the question of what the future technologies for virtual interaction might hold (as provided in advance of the event by Professor Sarah Kenderdine, a member of the DARIAH Scientific Advisory Board), and a brief reflection on some of the lessons the DARIAH VX programme committee felt they had learned in the course of developing the VX content and structure. Recordings of these plenaries were added to the virtual exhibition after the event so participants could re-visit them and reflect upon any key moments or inspired thoughts they had. The advantage of digital media is that participants could use the recordings as memory triggers for any desired follow-up actions, which can be common outcomes after non-virtual conferences. These recordings are available at: <a href="https://www.virtualexchange.dariah.eu/">https://www.virtualexchange.dariah.eu/</a>.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="c-serendipity-and-the-prepared-mind-the-virtual-exhibition--liveness-investigation">C. Serendipity and the prepared mind: The Virtual Exhibition &amp; Liveness Investigation</h2>
<p>If engagement, serendipity, discovery and connection all seemed to be impoverished in virtual meetings, The DARIAH VX would need to find some way to encourage its participants to give themselves the time and space to prepare their minds if the event was to be a success. In addition, we realised in our preparations that what we could never recreate in a virtual space was the situated, physical, embodied experiences and learning of the face-to-face meeting, and thus we had to think from an early moment of how we might bring in an explicit conceptual element to our event to explore these aspects. DARIAH’s position as an infrastructure for the arts as well as the humanities gives us a broad community of practitioners, and no one knows better than theatre practitioners the difference between live engagement and interactions mediated by space, cameras and microphones. Thus, we engaged in a meta reflection of this through the Liveness Investigation.</p>
<h2 id="the-virtual-exhibition">The Virtual Exhibition</h2>
<p>The intention behind the exhibition was to recreate the sense of anticipation and serendipity in knowledge acquisition that one achieves through conference attendance by creating a Wunderkammer of resources: offering multiple routes to different items, with no expectation that all participants might engage with every single item on display. To achieve this, a few different platforms were investigated, however, in order to complete this in the limited time available and to keep it simple, it was decided that a Wordpress.org based site was the most feasible and the layout allowed for the serendipitous discovery.</p>
<p>The structure of the virtual exhibition was informed by the most common spaces found at face-to-face meetings, and the information one may find in them (see Figures 2-4). For example, the Registration Desk offered lists of fellow participants, practical information such as how to sign up to the main Virtual Exchange event, and a programme of events. It also introduced the organisation (DARIAH) and the team behind the event, and provided some links relevant to the topic of Scholarly Primitives. The main auditorium, renamed here as the Knowledge Exchange Space, had the items related to the themes of the live event grouped thematically, sometimes overlapping, or offering different perspectives on similar topics. Finally came the Coffee Break Space that encouraged interaction and allowed for less formal discussions around the themes of the event (including the participant anecdotes and COVID-19). The Coffee Break section of the virtual exhibition also included resources intended to invoke, if not truly serve, some of the most prominent latent purposes of scholarly meetings, referencing interpersonal connections and a sense of space and place with links to various audio-visual experiences elsewhere on the internet. This included a Spotify playlist<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  compiled by members of the DARIAH Coordination Office, who are themselves dispersed across Europe and offer a wide selection of idiosyncratic musical tastes, and a place to upload a deskie photo that would allow participants to share images of their participation spaces with the wider group.</p>

The description reads, “Here you can explore a selection of resources and ideas exploring the many primitives of and issues surrounding scholarly meetings, together with a broader range of source relating to the current COVID-19 crisis.This living online exhibition, organised by DARIAH-EU, will be updated from 21 until 28 May 2020. This exhibition acts as a pool of prompts and provocations for thought and conversation, a dialogue that will culminate in a 2-hour synchronous virtual exchange session on the 28th (from 14:00-16:00 UTC&#43;1). Further information about the event, the team behind it, the topic and other COVID-related initiatives that inspired this structure are available here.(ed note — the word here is a hyperlink.)

<p>These three elements within the Virtual Exhibition allowed participants to spend as much or as little time as they wanted (without making them feel it was something they needed to complete) finding new perspectives on the theme of the Virtual Exchange. There was discussion among the programme committee as to whether we should include a floor plan that listed all the items on offer, or whether it would be best to allow participants to discover things for themselves, in an easter egg style. Ultimately we decided to keep the sense of serendipitous discovery by not providing this floor plan. Additional challenges in creating this space lay in the decisions around which items best fit into which spaces, and identifying at what point we might start imposing our own biases on the pathways people could take through the exhibition and risk removing the sense of accidental discovery that we wanted to achieve. As ever, knowledge organisation and asset curation is a challenge, so we made sure to flag very clearly to participants the status of these resources as prompts and provocations rather than a complete, fully theorised, scholarly collection. A full list of the assets in the Virtual Exhibition appears in Appendix 1 of this paper.</p>
<h2 id="the-liveness-investigation-an-arts-based-response">The Liveness Investigation: An arts-based response</h2>
<p>The ideas of liveness and co-presence are inextricably linked with drama practice. While many theatre arts practitioners have begun to play with new technologies in order to adapt and bring them into arts practice, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated innovation and rethinking of how it might be possible to practice the craft in an online setting. Within applied drama praxis, with its focus on embodiment and collaboration, the tools of drama/theatre were specifically utilised in the DARIAH VX event in order to explore ideas and create dialogue amongst participants. The collective knowledge that is generated through this process relies on participants’ absorption and interpretation of information through their entire being: all of their senses, body, mind, and feelings/emotions. How is this altered when it is moved into a completely online space? What might be gained? What might be lost?</p>
<p>In the spirit of show me, don’t tell me (a mantra of theatre educators around the globe), the  “Liveness Investigation”  created specifically for this DARIAH VX event sought to explore this topic as a meta-reflection through a presentation and discussion of a piece of research that compared two instances of theatrical collaboration with the same format and participants, but delivered ten years apart. The first collaboration was conducted in a physical space that was captured during the development of a 2011 project entitled  “The Other F Word” , and then again with the same participants in a virtual space. The presentation to the DARIAH VX participants also included the reflections from the  “The Other F Word”  workshop participants on the adaptation from an in-person setting to an online one, and of the project leaders.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaway from this exploration for the participants and the Artist-Researcher who facilitated it was the understanding that moving the practice online created something new, with new possibilities. Many elements of connection that manifest when sharing physical space, such as nuanced nonverbal communication (especially eye contact) and kinetic information relayed through placement, proxemics, and direction were largely lost in the online space. The in-person machines, which were made up of small groups of live performing artists, allowed for each contributor to build upon what the previous person had offered. The creative process for working in shared physical space allowed for deeper co-creation and collaboration intrinsically during the act of creation. This is in contrast with the machines that were created online being much more of a collage of individual contributions to the ideas offered (such as the love machine or hate machine). The online creative process was marked by most individuals responding<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  on their own to create within a kind of vacuum — with the collaboration and meaning-making actually coming afterward in the workshop reflection in which there was an attempt to create understanding about the machine as a whole. The online practice showed signs of potentially further empowering participants to contribute more personal, individualised responses, however.</p>
<p>In light of these discoveries, what becomes clear is that the format (in-person or online) which will be most conducive for a meeting, workshop, or gathering depends on the purpose and goals of the gathering. If it is crucial to build a sense of community and co-create contemporaneously, then an in-person setting would be ideal. However, if it is crucial to allow space for each participant to act individually, then an online platform may well be optimal for highlighting that endeavour. The nature of these differences, and the manner in which technological affordances might be modified in order to be more focussed on certain kinds of interaction defined in these terms, is still largely unexplored. While a great deal more remains to be explored in this area, it feels necessary to encourage a both/and way of moving forward with in-person and online gatherings rather than an either/or model when it becomes available post-COVID. Insights from this exploration were further integrated into the DARIAH VX event through the inclusion of a small breathing exercise informed by applied drama praxis. The Prezi and videos of the Liveness Investigation can be found here: <a href="https://prezi.com/view/sBDCS3iZisELjh76VCq1/">https://prezi.com/view/sBDCS3iZisELjh76VCq1/</a></p>
<h2 id="d-breakout-sessions-and-semi-formal-knowledge-sharing">D. Breakout sessions and semi-formal knowledge sharing</h2>
<p>The breakout sessions in the DARIAH VX event were included as a way to encourage engagement and connection among participants on topics that are not commonly appearing in the research-output focused programmes of in-person conference. The same registration form that solicited their input about events and primitives was also used to recruit presentations and to identify and cluster their interests resulting in seven breakout session themes, titled as follows:</p>
<p>“Making (virtual) interactions work better”    Presenters: Rimi Nandy (Adamas University) and Sarah Middle (Open University)   “Breaking down barriers — of career stage, language, discipline or other — between researchers”    Presenters: Paul Spence (King&rsquo;s College London) and Nicole Basaraba (Trinity College Dublin)     “Academics in the Ether: Tackling the challenges of working away from the office”   Presenters: Claire Warwick (Durham University) and Mariann Hardey (Durham University)    “DH Methods and Tools Gone Wrong: Discoveries, Failures &amp; Advice for the Future”   Presenters: Quinn Dombrowski (Stanford University) and Amelia del Rosario Sanz (Universidad Complutense)   “Working together to move forward: Fostering collaboration for projects, grant proposals, or publications”   Presenters: Michelle Doran (Trinity College Dublin) and Francesca Morselli (DARIAH-EU)   “The Academic Footprint: Sustainable methods for knowledge exchange”   Presenter: Geoffrey Rockwell (University of Alberta)   “In Praise of Presence: Why do we travel to meet?”   Presenters: Vicky Garnett (Trinity College Dublin) and Courtney Grile (Trinity College Dublin)</p>
<p>Participants were informed before the sessions that discussion would take place in small groups, last 30 minutes, and were designed as opportunities to make connections based on common interests and share ideas. Each session was supported by a DARIAH VX organising team member, a chair, a support person who served as rapporteur of the discussions and one or two presenters who opened the discussion with some thought-provoking ideas in a five-minute presentation. The Zoom platform breakout groups function was used to move participants to/from the small group which was pre-selected based on shared interests stated in the pre-attendance questionnaire. Participants were also informed that the sessions would not be recorded and that we had set up shared documents for each group in which they could keep a record of their discussion.</p>
<p>Each of the seven breakout sessions focussed on some facet of academic conferences, in-person versus virtual, and the impacts these formats have in terms of travel, sustainability, and ability and methods for researcher collaborations, and were designed to provide participants with a chance to emulate the informal discussions that happen in the hallways after conference presentations or at the coffee station, rather than more formal question and answer discussions after a 15-20 minute presentation from each speaker. The breakout sessions were 30 minutes long and participants were pre-divided into groups of less than 10 people each, to ensure the potential for real discussion. The breakout sessions were not recorded but the rapporteur took notes in a shared Google document that all session participants could view and contribute to. Across the seven sessions, four main themes of conversation emerged which were: (1) navigating personal and professional spaces, (2) technical and financial practicalities, (3) methods of communication, and (4) academic status.</p>
<p>In terms of navigating personal and professional spaces, breakout session participants discussed how working from home during COVID-19 has created greater challenges in separating the formal workspace and time from leisure and family time in the home. Academics may try to multitask during online conferences, but they need to explicitly block out time for virtual conferences as they would when travelling for an in-person conference. The physical separation of colleagues during COVID-19 had made people more conscious about connecting with those whom they would normally meet informally without making specific plans. This extended to the casual relationship-building that happens at in-person conferences when new people meet professionally, but serendipitously form friendships through the collective experience of listening to presentations and participating in the social and cultural activities. The consensus was that virtual conferences and meetings could be most useful for people who have already met and established a working relationship, but that establishing this rapport was more difficult to build online when meeting someone for the first time.</p>
<p>The second theme that arose in discussions surrounded the technical and financial considerations for virtual conferences and meetings. Zoom had emerged as the most popular platform among academics, and video calls often lasted between one to two hours. However, Zoom calls can be exhausting because they take more mental effort to carefully consider what you say since you are in a performance-like situation. There can also be a multitude of possible environmental distractions, including the background views of individuals’ personal spaces, and if two people are meeting for the first time on Zoom, these distractions could be considered unprofessional by the other person due to the lack of a pre-existing relationship. If Zoom calls are recorded, it often results in modified behaviours of participants. There have also been technical and security issues with some virtual calls as well as data protection issues, which in some cases resulted in weakened trust. It was noted that funding would be needed to have technical support for large virtual conference calls, which may also have smaller breakout sessions, in order to permit conversations and presentations to flow without interruption.</p>
<p>In regards to methods of communication, some key differences were highlighted between in-person and virtual conferences. DARIAH VX participants noted that sometimes it can be difficult to read people’s body language when online. Tone of voice alone is not always the best way to understand colleagues or conference participants. Another person said that they can become distracted by seeing their own face and background during a video call. Each academic community, whether it be at an annual conference or the specific disciplinary conventions, has different styles and expectations for presentations and interactions, but across the board, it was noted that ability to digitally access and share content is very important to virtual academic exchanges. Issues of inclusion were very much on the minds of the DARIAH participants as well: the presence of a moderator or chair is often needed for larger groups to ensure each voice is heard and that those with questions or comments from the audience get the chance to speak up. In addition, as when many in-person academic conferences are in English, linguistic marginalisation can flatten diversity in the discussions and the academic discipline more generally, a situation only intensified by the impoverishment of online communications. One possible solution offered was to include slides in another language to allow for better communication to those who may not speak or understand English as their primary language. This would allow them to get more out of the presentation/content if they can follow along in their first language. Finally, it can be difficult to connect with another scholar/participant until they give their presentation, as the ability to discuss ideas flows easier after one hears about the other’s interests in more detail. Collaboration often relies on serendipity, but social distancing has drained much of the serendipity out of our professional lives, with everything needing to be scheduled and social media offering an active space for connection, but one in which diversity, complexity and context might be diminished.</p>
<p>The final theme that emerged in the discussions was the role of hierarchies and status in academia in relation to attending and playing specific roles in conferences. For example, flying to conferences confers status, yet this culture needs to change for academia to be more inclusive of those who cannot get university funding to travel to exchange knowledge. Another consideration is the limited discussions on academic methods and practice. Early-career researchers may fear that publishing or speaking about their failures or methods that did not produce fruitful research results could have negative consequences for their academic career. On the contrary, in a situation where status or reputation is already assured, it is easier to talk about research shortcomings one has experienced. Without discussing or sharing failures scholarship can fail to move forward, with other scholars making the same mistakes because nobody has documented a similar attempt that did not work. A solution that was offered was that if one scholar does not want to bear the weight of failure alone, they could discuss or publish it as a collective group or write in other venues like on social media.</p>
<p>The difference in terms of the keynote speakers versus PhD candidates and the lack of informal conversations between senior and early career scholars is a gap at virtual conferences that some felt in-person conferences were perhaps far better able to facilitate, though not without the investment needed to break down barriers. Thoughts on whether a better model could be developed in the virtual context was an exciting opportunity to explore. People, after all, are the focus of collaboration: we do not work with institutions, we work with each other. Even while there may be an enduring valorisation of the solitary scholar, there is also a generation of scholars who recognise that we often work better together.</p>
<p>These breakout sessions offered the participants opportunities not only to explore the themes of the workshop, and put them into the context of their own words and experiences, but also to connect their current experiences to their wider personal and professional lives. In particular topics like hierarchies, dealing with failures, isolation and mental health, and inclusiveness cut to the heart of not just how we might as a community of scholars navigate the new normal, but also how we might use this moment to improve conditions of the preexisting state of scholarly communities. Many of these topics were not specific to digital humanities, and yet the context and many of the connections made, such as the role of collaboration and the tensions between cultural and communicative signals and the technology that mediated them, most certainly were.</p>
<p>The DARIAH VX approach to reporting back from the plenaries also reflected our intention to use the opportunity of the COVID-19 forced change in format as an opportunity to rethink the format of the scholarly meeting at a higher level. The group shared a certain frustration with the level of engagement that tended to be accorded to the mechanisms of sharing breakout discussions with a plenary, while also recognising their important role as a social buffer between larger and smaller groups. We therefore asked each group to provide back to the plenary five keywords that reflected central points of their discussion, one challenge statement and one opportunity statement. These inputs were included in the slides for the final plenary, where they were presented and connections between them drawn out, without the opportunity for a longer discussion. The results of this exercise appear in Appendix 2.</p>
<p>This method had the benefit of allowing the discussions to be seen from an almost distant reading point of view, while also not increasing potential cognitive load on participants with a session of reports that could easily have run long or lacked structure.</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-the-dariah-vx-experience">Evaluating the DARIAH VX Experience</h2>
<p>As the DARIAH VX came to an end, the programme committee gathered again to discuss and evaluate the event as an experience both for us as organisers, but also for the audience participating and following the event through social media. What was their experience and how did this compare to ours? Was the event considered meaningful and useful? Had we succeeded in creating an engaging virtual experience? Soon after the event, we launched a post-event survey to capture these reactions and opinions. This survey consisted of eleven multiple choice and three open questions and was left open for two weeks. It welcomed answers from participants but also presenters in the various sessions and organisers. In the end, thirteen people completed the survey and overall they valued positively the event and their participation. Although there was a low response rate, as is also common in optional post-event surveys and not a statistically authoritative sample, it was indicative of another observed phenomenon of the pandemic period, namely a certain virtual activity fatigue, and there were enough strong trends in the responses to merit some concluding reflections here.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the event was to encourage informal conversations happening in the background, in parallel to the event, either in social media or in the chat. This was also stressed in the opening keynote, as discussed above. Conferences are great networking opportunities, places to meet colleagues and friends but also make new acquaintances and start new collaborations. Encouraging people to replicate this in the virtual event was again an aspect we hoped to experiment with, to see if we could improve upon the current average standard for this online. In the respective question in the follow up survey (a true/false response to the statement  “the event helped me to broaden my scholarly networks and make new contacts” ) the answers were very diverse. Despite the fact that people did feel part of a community during the event (nine positive responses), most of them were not able to network and start new discussions/collaborations in the background.</p>
<p>The whole event, its innovative approach and the rich collection of sources hosted in the virtual exhibition made a very positive buzz on social media and in particular Twitter (the Twitter moment for the event can be found here: <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moment_maker/preview/1265955693984731136">https://twitter.com/i/moment_maker/preview/1265955693984731136</a>). Researchers and projects following the event through Twitter or indeed participating in the DARIAH VX had very positive remarks to share about the experimental approach, take away messages and new terminology emerging with this new virtual space for interaction, the need for conferences and why they are vital to a researcher’s work. These responses also included more informal and personal information, such as images of their home offices and reflections on how they adapted to the new situation. With a feeling of we are in this together, the DARIAH VX created a virtual space for sharing scholarly notions, expressing personal remarks and concerns on the future of conferences, traveling, research and the scholarly profession that was greatly appreciated and was in some way comforting at a time when no physical contact was possible. Providing such an opportunity for personal connection, transcending our disciplines and institutions, may have been in fact one of the most important and telling contributions of the DARIAH VX.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The DARIAH VX was an exercise in both theorising a new kind of virtual scholarly meeting based upon a scholarly primitives approach, and, simultaneously, building an exemplary event to demonstrate how such a new paradigm might be enacted. While it may therefore have only cast some tentative first seeds on this broad field for experimentation and consideration, we can certainly propose some of the following as key learnings and points for future work to begin from in the consideration of the future of scholarly meetings:</p>
<p>First, we need to better harness the explosion of accepted paradigms for informal scholarly interaction online as resources to hone our virtual and face-to-face meetings. In the realm of written scholarly communications, we are observing a sea change in the rise of informal outlets for sharing scholarly knowledge. While we still may have a long way to go toward protecting this knowledge (in every sense), a better understanding of the interplay between formal and informal layers of scholarship can also improve our practices of meeting.</p>
<p>Second, we need to still gather people, e.g. in small, virtually connected groups, so as to seed rich experiences and empathetic responses while still respecting the nomadic nature of knowledge (as already proposed by <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>) The DARIAH VX Liveness Investigation made clear the essential role of presence in supporting empathy, attention and engagement, but it also asked the question of how much presence we need: is it enough to have a small group around you, to model the kind of trustful, attentive and mindful attitude we should generally approach our scholarly meetings with? Could technology that enabled certain things currently lost, such as real eye contact, make a difference?</p>
<p>Third, we need to use mobility more deftly, holistically, mindfully and evenly, making it accessible in ways that don’t simply introduce new and different barriers. Better thinking is needed on how to improve access to knowledge exchange opportunities across the board for non-native English listeners, caregivers, participants in non- or less privileged power hierarchy positions such as Early Career Researchers, not to mention people with disabilities, slow or unreliable broadband, or any number of other challenges to participation.</p>
<p>Fourth, we need interaction technologies to get us beyond the skeuomorphic facsimiles of meetings that we have to become spaces of productive interaction. There is incredible tech out there, but for every collaborator you may have who is dedicated to one platform or another, there is another for whom that new tool may present an annoyance, at least, or barrier at worst, in terms of learning curve, bandwidth or screen management.</p>
<p>The DARIAH experiment in applying the very central digital humanities paradigm of the scholarly primitive to our interactions rather than our research processes also yielded fruitful and interesting results, bearing out our hypothesis that digital humanities could learn and contribute greater precision to the contemporary debates about how we might optimally adjust to post-incunabular virtual meeting practices. This builds from the foundation where the arts and cultural heritage took an early leadership position in driving social innovations to soften the force of fear and isolation. Cultural heritage institutions from across the world transcended their usual user engagement strategies to innovate and plan virtual paths that would, in the first instance, showcase their content and artifacts and, in the second, make culture a comforting place for people to retreat to and learn from. The challenge of maintaining human contact within and across virtual spaces presented an opportunity and an imperative to understand the art in our science. A recent consideration of art and AI comes to the conclusion that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… art emerged as a way for our Pleistocene ancestors to strengthen their social ties and social status. For example, art can serve as gifts, as fitness signals for mating, and as displays of status and tribal affiliation. In each role, the fundamental purpose of art is to affect peoples&rsquo; relationships with each other, where the relationships are themselves important.<br>
<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup><br>
Hertzmann’s ultimate conclusion is that computers can create art, but they don’t need to: people, however, do. While people do also need to create scientific knowledge, they can’t do this without the communities, contexts and interactions that nurture their minds, bodies and souls. Let us hope that we can find creative ways to usher in new forms of scholarly meetings that combine the incentives of both science and art.</p>

<p>The list of keywords was as follows: uneasy, domestic, accessibility, aura, interactivity, participation, trust, intentionality, diversity, failing gloriously, distance, mentorship, connecting individuals, eternal prototypes, respect, networking, place, noise, stigma, facilitating (role of institution) cultural experience, social bonds.</p>
<p>The list of challenges was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where it is hard to concentrate, compose oneself or know when to be heard;</li>
<li>Attention of participants/ Control of Students / Multiple channels / Risk Situation / Surveillance;</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s stopping you from talking about failure? It could be (mostly) unfounded to think too much about what funders/colleagues may think;</li>
<li>Small conferences are/might be better in handling this — digital conferences which by aspiration/default are large are less suitable for that;</li>
<li>We do not want to lose the connection and the rich experience;</li>
<li>Personal VS professional life, how much do we share; and</li>
<li>The environmental impact of travel, the monetary expense and if we can travel in after times</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of opportunities was:</p>
<ul>
<li>To experience new ways to simply &lsquo;be&rsquo; in digital space.</li>
<li>maybe we can make interactions more accessible across barriers (economic, career stage, regional)</li>
<li>Flexibility and inclusiveness</li>
<li>Towards a taxonomy of failure</li>
<li>We need a look-up, inspirational corner about conference formats, flavours — a kind of chocolate box you can choose from; elements other disciplines are good at, and one might try out;</li>
<li>personal VS professional life, how much do we share; and</li>
<li>Zoom offers moments of insight — get to see where someone lives!</li>
</ul>

<p>Responding to a telegram invitation from the University of Pennsylvania, an ambitious 28-year old Harvard-trained scholar brought his new bride to Philadelphia in 1896 to answer questions posed by the white women of the College Settlement Association: Why are the Black residents of Philadelphia not doing better economically and what is the solution to this Negro Problem? <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. He was able to set aside the patronizing nature of the prompt — he was sure that the women already had their answer to that question; the indignity of being named an assistant in the sociology department rather than an instructor; the fact that he would not have an office; and the overall lack of official recognition — and accepted the invitation <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This ambitious and talented scholar, none other than W. E. B. Du Bois, methodically collected and analyzed data through surveys, interviews, and observations along with a review of archival sources, census data, local government reports, and the press, ultimately reframing the idea of the Negro problem.</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on Black residents as a problem, he transformed the phrase to mean the distinct problems of a group of people who faced systematic racial discrimination in the primary domains of their lives, including health, occupation and employment, education and literacy, housing and the environment, voting, and institutional life. That is racism, not Black pathology, explained the poverty and crime the women of the College Settlement Association lamented. In making this argument, Du Bois set himself apart from most other scholars and Americans at the turn of the 20th century. Today, that argument is central to Critical Race Theory (CRT) and the #BlackLivesMatter movement, and nearly half of all Americans acknowledge that Black people face a lot of discrimination <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This article examines Du Bois&rsquo; 1899 study of the everyday lives of Black residents of Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward by juxtaposing his research methods with our contemporary efforts to recover, recreate, and preserve  _The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study _ (hereafter,  <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em> ) using digital and geospatial technologies. Here, we explore the primary source documents, mining them for new details of how Du Bois conducted his research, and focus on the humanities and social science research methods he employed. In particular, this article focuses on Du Bois&rsquo; survey techniques and the color-coded parcel-level map that he created of Black social class status, reflecting the influence of the Social Survey movement and his efforts to present a new understanding of the color line <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The range of methods he used to analyze a wide array of primary and secondary data was essential to his groundbreaking findings. Disavowing the view of most social scientists of his time that Black people were (a) biologically inferior and (b) socially homogeneous, Du Bois documented both the variability and social stratification within Philadelphia’s Black population. With this careful empirical investigation, he pointed to the need to recognize the full humanity of Black people and address what today we call anti-Black racism in order to solve this Negro Problem  <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. This study continues Du Bois&rsquo; work by using what Gallon, writing within the field of Black digital humanities, calls the  “technology of recovery, characterized by efforts to bring forth the full humanity of marginalized peoples through the use of digital platforms and tools”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>More than one hundred years after the publication of Du Bois&rsquo; seminal work, society is still plagued with the same problems of individual prejudice and structural racism, which have been reinvented, reshaped, and reinforced. Our ongoing project,  <em>The WARD: Race and Class in Du Bois&rsquo; Seventh Ward</em> , employs both old and new technologies to recreate Du Bois&rsquo; study and advance research on the state of America’s race problem. A property-level historical geographic information system (GIS) of Du Bois&rsquo; Seventh Ward forms the foundation of our contemporary research and our teaching and public history project based on  <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em> . Like Du Bois, we use interviews and observation, archival research, census data, local government reports, directories, the press, and mapping. We depart from Du Bois&rsquo; study, however, by using new technologies and participatory research methods that engage high school and college students as part of the research process <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. While Du Bois wrote primarily for an audience of elite white leaders, our project seeks to make the lives of Seventh Ward residents accessible to young people across race, class, and gender. The in-depth, intergenerational oral histories conducted with students add a new dimension to this research; these histories also complement our high school curriculum’s interactive mapping, documentaries, board game, walking tour, and mural. These curriculum tools allow students to become co-researchers. Much like Du Bois’ later research during his time at Atlanta University, our process engages students to help to create visualizations <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Our project extends Du Bois&rsquo; original work through the use of both old new technologies, amplifying his central argument that white people of that era were unwilling to embrace the full humanity of their Black neighbors. White people typically viewed Black people as an inferior race at the time of his study, understood in today’s language as white supremacy and anti-Black racism. This manifested in material subordination, structural forms of exclusion, and individual prejudice, all techniques used by white people to keep most Black people from the significant economic advancement that they had anticipated when they migrated to the North <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. We revisit Du Bois&rsquo; work by focusing on the stories and experiences of the Black residents he studied, as well as subsequent generations of Black residents who have lived in and around the Seventh Ward. We also directly engage youth of color and their white peers in the recreation, examination, and expansion of Du Bois&rsquo; seminal work. In so doing, we highlight ways to examine the contemporary challenges of the color line — gentrification, housing discrimination, racial profiling, and mass incarceration — that we and our young people face. This research also provides historical context for today’s racial unrest and persistent racial inequities.</p>
<h2 id="the-influence-of-the-social-survey-movement-and-social-work">The Influence of the Social Survey Movement and Social Work</h2>
<p>Too often, scholars understand Du Bois&rsquo; approach to studying the Black population of Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward exclusively within academic sociology rather than seeing connections to applied sociology, social work, philanthropy, and the Social Survey Movement. Concentrated in England and the United States between 1880 and 1920, the Social Survey Movement produced numerous empirical studies concerning the realities of urban life for immigrants and the poor <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Charles Booth, the wealthy British merchant, launched the movement with a scientific investigation in the 1880s to assess the level and nature of poverty in London. Booth employed an army of women to make house calls and register children for school; he then cross-checked the data they collected with information from philanthropists, social workers, policemen, and other sources <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Booth’s great multi-volume work,  <em>Life and Labor of the People of London</em>   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>, detailed the social classes, patterns of income, employment, and forms of labor in several thousand pages of text. A series of block-level color-coded maps, depicting the spatial nature of poverty in 19th century London, provided a compelling summary of the overwhelming data which proved critical for Booth’s call to move from debate to action <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The female sociologists and social workers of that time were exemplary practitioners of applied sociology and welcomed Du Bois into their circle <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Hull-House Settlement founder Jane Addams and social reformer Florence Kelly produced the  _Hull-House Maps and Papers _ in 1895. Like Booth’s efforts, they used community-based research involving extensive field work and interviews to produce a series of color-coded maps of nationalities and wages of residents by household <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. This work also included empirical studies of immigrants, working conditions, specific laborers, labor unions, social settlements, and the function of art in the community, in addition to a critique of social services. Influenced by their scholarship and activism, Du Bois joined forces with these pioneers, who were largely marginalized by the male-dominated academy. They shared the dual goals of documenting social conditions and using their research to fight the inequality of Jim Crow segregationist and discriminatory policies and practices <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Booth and the women of Hull House served as models for Du Bois’ work in Philadelphia in their methods and commitment to documenting poor social conditions to inspire social change <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="du-bois-invitation-to-philadelphia">Du Bois&rsquo; Invitation to Philadelphia</h2>
<p>On June 8, 1896, University of Pennsylvania Provost Charles Harrison sent a telegram to W. E. B. Du Bois, who was then teaching classics at Wilberforce College in Ohio, the first private Black college in the country. Harrison’s telegram invited Du Bois to conduct a study of Black people living in Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward. The invitation — like many of today’s text messages — was terse, simply stating:  “Are ready to appoint you for one year at nine hundred dollars maximum payable monthly from the date of service. If you wish appointment will write definitely”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Though formally issued by the University, Du Bois&rsquo; invitation came at the prompting of the women who ran Philadelphia’s College Settlement Association (CSA). Philanthropist Susan P. Wharton, a member of the wealthy Wharton family for whom the the University of Pennsylvania’s business school is named, convened a meeting at her home of leading citizens interested in the welfare of Black people in Philadelphia. She said that the study should focus on the problems of the Black residents and the  “obstacles to be encountered by the colored people in their endeavor to be self-supporting”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Wharton’s motivation, consistent with the goals of the Social Survey Movement, blended philanthropy, science, and political advocacy <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. In addition to Penn’s Provost, her neighbor Dr. Harrison, Wharton invited merchant and philanthropist Robert C. Ogden, editor Talcott Williams, and Fannie Jackson Coppin, the prominent African-American educator and first lady of the Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. She initially imagined hiring a white woman social worker to conduct the research but was swayed by Samuel Lindsay, a faculty member in Penn’s Sociology Department, who recommended Du Bois. Du Bois&rsquo; proven work ethic, his education at Fisk and Harvard universities, and his history and sociology studies in Germany made him the ideal candidate for this research <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. Du Bois was grateful to have a new job; he considered this opportunity and his recent marriage to have spelled salvation from the small-mindedness of the Midwestern Evangelical college where he had suffered for two years <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="data-collection-and-analysis-for-the-philadelphia-negro">Data Collection and Analysis for The Philadelphia Negro</h2>
<p>As a young scholar, Du Bois had abundant faith in the power of science to effect social change.  “The Negro problem was in my mind a matter of systematic investigation and intelligent understanding,”  he explained in reference to the invitation to conduct research in Philadelphia <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.  “The world was thinking wrong about race, because it did not know. The cure for it was knowledge based on scientific investigation”   <sup id="fnref2:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. His research incorporated multiple methods of inquiry and analysis. The door-to-door surveys he conducted with all the Black households in the Seventh Ward were the most time-consuming aspect of his study. He sat in the parlors, kitchens, and living rooms of 2,500 households listening and documenting their stories. W. E. B Du Bois — unlike Booth, Kelly, and Addams — had no research assistants; he conducted all the interviews himself, following a detailed interview schedule he developed. In addition to this list of questions for heads of household, he developed questions about Black businesses and streets or alleys (see Figure 1). In what was perhaps the University of Pennsylvania’s only direct involvement with the study, the institution sent these questionnaires out for comment to leading scholars, including Booker T. Washington, but there is no evidence that Du Bois made any significant changes based on this outside feedback. He explained in  <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em>  that he usually spoke with the head of the household’s wife for between 10 and 60 minutes, with an average duration of 15 to 25 minutes <sup id="fnref2:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. All together, he likely spent more than 800 hours conducting these interviews, five months of full-time work by today’s standards. However, Du Bois likely worked longer days and weekends given the tight schedule and limited compensation — approximately $30,000 in today’s dollars, slightly more than a doctoral stipend at the University of Pennsylvania today and significantly less than a typical post-doctoral salary.</p>

<p>In addition to the exhaustive door-to-door surveying, Du Bois consulted notable local Black figures, whom he acknowledged in his preface to  <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em>   <sup id="fnref3:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Reverend Henry Phillips was the leader of Church of the Crucifixion, a Black Episcopal church located at 8th and Bainbridge Streets on the southern edge of the Seventh Ward. Du Bois described the Church of the Crucifixion as  “perhaps the most effective church organization in the city for benevolent and rescue work”   <sup id="fnref4:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. This assessment downplayed the role of Mother Bethel A.M.E., the most historic of the Black churches in the area.  “This church [the Church of the Crucifixion] especially reaches after a class of neglected poor whom the other colored churches shun or forget…”   <sup id="fnref5:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. George Mitchell, another of Du Bois&rsquo; advisers, was among the few Black lawyers admitted to the Philadelphia bar before 1900 <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. W. Carl Bolivar, a journalist and bibliophile, wrote a column for  <em>The Philadelphia Tribune</em> , the leading Black newspaper. Eighty-year-old Robert F. Adger, a well-off furniture dealer who owned a store on South Street, was the sole businessman whom Du Bois listed as an advisor. Adger founded the Benjamin Banneker Institute, an intellectual and literary association <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. William Dorsey, a Black archivist who kept scrapbooks detailing issues and events relevant to Black people in Philadelphia well into the twentieth century, rounded out the group <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to collecting information from these primary sources, Du Bois  “went through the Philadelphia libraries for data [and] gained access in many instances to private libraries of colored folk”   <sup id="fnref3:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. The five-page bibliography in  <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em>  listed the secondary sources that Du Bois consulted, including state legislation, history books, and church reports. He cited the works of 35 Black Philadelphian authors including Richard Allen, Martin Robinson Delaney, Jarena Lee, William Still, and Benjamin T. Tanner <sup id="fnref6:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Throughout the book, there are references to the administrative data he reviewed, particularly vital statistics and disease records from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, crime records from the Philadelphia Police Department, and newspaper clippings. Du Bois relied on church histories, minutes from local church conferences, and a report of churches from the eleventh U.S. census in 1890 <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> to capture the organized life of Black people through their congregations. Using such records as the membership growth and value of property owned by the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, Du Bois presented the state of the Church, a task facilitated by having both the headquarters and publishing house of the A.M.E. Church located in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The greatest data analysis challenge Du Bois faced was making sense of the answers from his door-to-door survey. Du Bois had to keep track of each household’s address and then connect that address to a map of the properties in the Seventh Ward to produce the color-coded property map of social class. There is no record of how he recorded the data in the field, particularly whether he adapted the large sheets that census enumerators used or came up with his own system. However, in the spring of 1897, presumably after finishing the surveys, Du Bois ordered 15,000 cards corresponding to the schedules from a Philadelphia printer. He probably transferred his field notes onto these cards so he could sort them to generate his summary statistics (see Figures 2 and 3). His original map appears to be based on the 1895 or 1896 Bromley fire insurance map — either an actual copy or a tracing. We also know that in 1890, the most recent census before Du Bois created his maps for Philadelphia, the U.S. Census categorized people as Indian, Chinese or Japenese, Black, Mulatto (3/8-5/8 black blood), Quadroon (1/4 black blood,), Octoroon (1/8 or any trace of black blood), or white <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Du Bois does not specify whether he included bi-racial or multi-racial people as Black, using the single category of Negro for all the households he interviewed, perhaps anticipating the collapsing of these Black and multi-racial identities into a single category and underscoring that any Black ancestors meant for practical purposes that one was Negro.</p>

<p>Before Du Bois could match his household data to the corresponding properties, he had to determine social class based on his survey results. He did not include a direct question about social class on any of his schedules; instead, he used questions about income and employment — both the type of work and consistency of it — as the most salient factors for making this determination. By making house visits, he was also able to consider  “the apparent circumstances of the family judging from the appearance of the home and inmates, the rent paid, the presence of lodgers, etc.”   <sup id="fnref7:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> . Du Bois deliberately used similar categories as Booth — vicious and criminal, poor, working people, and middle class — so he could compare the distribution of social class status among Seventh Ward residents to those of London.</p>
<h2 id="reframing-the-negro-problem">Reframing the Negro Problem</h2>
<p>To complete  _The Philadelphia Negro, _ Du Bois  “labored morning, noon and night”   <sup id="fnref4:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. He imagined that his sponsors had already identified the  “corrupt, semi-criminal vote of the Negro Seventh Ward”   <sup id="fnref5:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> as the problem that prevented them from bringing about moral reform and better governance for the city. Black people sold their votes to Republicans in exchange for a limited number of municipal jobs and the protection for their voting clubs, which were often illegal drinking houses <sup id="fnref2:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.  “Everyone agreed that here lay the cancer,”  he explained — everyone except him <sup id="fnref8:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Du Bois and his wife of three months, Nina Gomer, lived in a one-room apartment at Seventh and Lombard Street over a cafeteria run by the Settlement House, which also had buildings on St. Mary’s Street (now Rodman Street, one block north of South Street) at the eastern edge of the Seventh Ward. This was the heart of the Negro slums, home to  “loafers, gamblers, prostitutes, and thieves”  — some of the people Du Bois would characterize as  “vicious and criminal”   <sup id="fnref9:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. He explained,  “We lived there a year, in the midst of an atmosphere of dirt, drunkenness, poverty, and crime. Murder sat on our doorsteps, police were our government, and philanthropy dropped in with periodic advice”   <sup id="fnref6:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Still, he wrote with uncharacteristic joy about his first Christmas with Nina, who was delighted to have a 15-cent Christmas tree  “with tinsel, fruit, and cotton snow”  and five dollars to spend on him at Wannamaker’s department store <sup id="fnref7:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.</p>
<p>He wanted to use the best social science tools, transcending disciplinary boundaries and investigating the complexity of the Negro problem. Though white Philadelphians largely thought of Black people as a monolithic group marked by chattel slavery and marginalized politically and economically, Du Bois revealed Black citizens in a new light by introducing the notion of Black heterogeneity across class, space, religion, and politics <sup id="fnref10:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>.  “Nothing more exasperates the better class of Negroes,”  such as himself,  “than this tendency to ignore utterly their existence”   <sup id="fnref11:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. With his color-coded parcel map highlighting the social class differences among Black residents (see Figure 4), he advanced our understanding of these within-group differences. He also argued indirectly that Black people were just like white people, thus challenging the prevailing theories of the day about white supremacy.</p>

<p>Du Bois studied Black people in their urban enclaves, highlighting the role of the social and physical environment in shaping their outcomes and documenting spatial inequalities, thereby anticipating the direction that public health research would take a century later <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. He also highlighted the historical, structural, and cultural factors that distinguished the experience of Black people from that of their immigrant neighbors. Ultimately, Du Bois rejected biological explanations and racial logics of Black inferiority. He rested his hopes first on the Black middle class to save the masses from the moral disorder that contributed to their poverty and second on the white benevolent despot to sweep away racial discrimination and remedy the lack of educational and employment opportunities <sup id="fnref12:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Du Bois finished his research in Philadelphia by the end of December 1897, just as his appointment ended and his new teaching position at Atlanta University began. He signed off on the book’s preface 18 months later, in June 1899, while teaching and writing his landmark essay,  “The Study of the Negro Problems,”  for the  <em>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.</em>  Inspired largely by his work in Philadelphia, this essay served as a research agenda and call to action for the next phase of his professional life. While on the faculty of Atlanta University, Du Bois refined his empirical data collection and data visualization techniques to draw attention to the significance of the color line and the plight of Black Americans at the 1900 Paris Exposition <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</p>

<p><em>The WARD: Race and Class in Du Bois&rsquo; Seventh Ward</em>  is an ongoing research, teaching, and public history project that uses geographic information systems (GIS), individual-level 1900 U.S. census data, and archival data to recreate Du Bois&rsquo; survey research to the extent possible (see: <a href="http://www.dubois-theward.org">http://www.dubois-theward.org</a>). Using old and new technologies, we expand the analytical capabilities and the stories of the color line from the 19th century to the 21st century with interactive mapping, a board game, documentaries, an oral history collection, a walking tour, a mural, and curriculum materials for high school students.  <em>The WARD</em>  project materials focus on Du Bois&rsquo; life and work in Philadelphia as a diligent social science researcher and courageous agent for social change. The project was initially funded in 2005 with a small grant from the University of Pennsylvania’s Research Foundation; the real dollar value of this grant was not much less than the compensation offered by the same university to Du Bois for his original study. Our project was largely advanced with funding from the National Endowment for Humanities and has been sustained by subsequent small grants from local foundations, the University of Pennsylvania, and Haverford College.</p>
<h2 id="primary-data-sources-for-the-ward">Primary Data Sources for The WARD</h2>
<p><em>The WARD</em>  relied primarily on address-level 1900 U.S. manuscript census data to recreate Du Bois’ door-to-door survey. Other primary sources included hospital admissions records, infectious disease records, newspaper articles, crime reports and mug books, historical photographs, court transcripts, and fire insurance records and maps. To complement these resources, we conducted oral histories with older members of the churches referenced in Du Bois&rsquo; original study. As we revisited and recovered Du Bois&rsquo; research, we did not follow his convention of anonymizing people, instead choosing to use the names and stories of individuals and their families as they highlighted the daily lives and struggles of Black people in the community, believing this would allow youth to connect more closely to them.</p>
<p>Maps and Spatial Data<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> . The individual and household-level data that Du Bois collected on Black households no longer exists, as far as archivists and Du Bois scholars know. The individual-level data collected through the 1900 U.S. census is the best available proxy for the people Du Bois found living in the Seventh Ward in 1897. Using the census enumerator sheets on microfilm (also available as scanned documents on Ancestry®), student research assistants entered the census data for the 28,000 Seventh Ward residents of all races into an electronic spreadsheet, including their name, age, place of birth for themselves and their parents, occupation (for adults), the number of children born and still alive (for adult women), schooling (for children), and their relationship to the head of household. Research assistants also created a corresponding GIS parcel layer by digitally tracing the boundaries of the approximately 5,000 properties in the Seventh Ward based on Bromley fire insurance maps, which also noted property ownership and the names of institutions. By lining up a high-resolution scan of the color-coded property map Du Bois created of the Seventh Ward with this digitized parcel layer, we were able to integrate the social grade Du Bois assigned each property into the Seventh Ward GIS. Ultimately this thick mapping collects, aggregates, and visualizes layers of place-specific data <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, adding nuance and greater detail regarding race, national origin and class to traditional archival sources.</p>
<p>The GIS data files work well for Lab exercises in undergraduate and graduate GIS courses, and we made them accessible to a broader range of students through a series of online interactive mapping platforms. Guided by worksheets, students analzyed the historical data in these applications as well as demographic changes over time using US Census data and Social Explorer®, a publicly-available mapping system. Students were able to look up individual residents of the Seventh Ward based on their name, age, occupation, and address. They could also create parcel-level maps to see patterns in race/ethnicity, nationality, household size, children enrolled in school, homeownership, and occupation. Because the dataset includes multiple variables, one can map multiple parameters simultaneously to visualize associations between, for example, place of birth and presence of boarders or servants — the best available proxies for low- and high-income households, respectively. Census block-level aggregations of the individual-level census data allow additional insights as distinct spatial patterns become more prominent (see Figure 6-10). The concentration of Black people in the lower half of the Seventh Ward, lodgers/boarders on the eastern side, and live-in servants in the northwestern section, further show this relationship between race and income. By combining the individual geocoded addresses with block-level data, it is possible to see that even the most prominent Black residents — physicians and caterers — lived on predominantly Black blocks where they would have lived with Black people of diverse social class (see Figures 5-9).</p>
<p>In addition to facilitating the analysis of these broad spatial patterns, the Seventh Ward GIS makes it possible to identify some of the Black individuals and households that contrasted with the general pattern. These include specific examples of interracial marriage, such as 46-year-old Oscar Stewart, a Black waiter born in Alabama who was married for 23 years to Katie, a 45-year-old housekeeper from Ireland. Many of the white women who were married to Black men were born in other countries, but not all of them. Similarly, while Black people rarely had live-in servants, there were some notable exceptions. Abraham Corney, a 50-year-old Black man born in Delaware, worked as a stevedore and lived with his wife, Virginia-born Bessie, a dress-maker; his 11-year-old son; a 63-year-old live-in servant, Lidia Anderson; and five lodgers. Arthur McKenzie, a 47-year-old junk dealer, born in the British West Indies, had a live-in servant and two lodgers. The female servant was 23 years old and McKenzie’s daughter was 19; both lodgers were men, one 25 and the other 26 years old.</p>

<p>A dozen physicians, including Nathan Mossell who founded Frederick Douglass Hospital for Black people in 1897, and nearly 50 Black caterers, including 8 women, composed much of the Black middle class and professional elite. Mapping this individual-level data from the 1900 Census along with block-level data on racial composition shows how even these Black elite lived with other Black residents rather than along the wealthy white streets like Spruce Street.</p>
<p>Oral histories. In 2012, we began collecting the oral histories of older African American members affiliated with the Black churches studied by Du Bois, namely Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church and Tindley Temple United Methodist, earlier known as Bainbridge Methodist Episcopal Church.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  These two congregations were located at the edge of the Seventh Ward and have experienced significant racial and economic change over the past 120 years (see Figure 10). We retrieved 30 oral histories recognizing the residents who once lived, worked or worshipped in or near the Seventh Ward as keepers of unrecorded history <sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Of the oral histories collected, Mr. Samuel Joyner’s stood out as the kind of narrative that would have attracted Du Bois&rsquo; attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Joyner, a retired artist, entrepreneur, World War II veteran, school teacher, and regular church member, was among the first to sit down with us in his home to share his story. Born in 1924, he described himself as a once-invisible artist who is now among the few award-winning African American political cartoonists in the country. He was surprised to find himself out of place in the North, a condition his family had expected to escape when migrating from the South. Mr. Joyner’s segregated military life in Alabama and the brutality of the South fueled his desire to use pen and ink to confront racism, discrimination, and poverty. In his words, life in the South  “made me feel like dirt, you know. I had to walk out in the street when white people came.”  During World War II, when he discovered that the United States would feed white German prisoners of war before feeding Black U.S. soldiers, he was left with a deep racial wound. He confronted a similar kind of Anglo-Saxon exceptionalism when he returned North. Gifted and educated, Joyner still often gave his work to his white peers to pass off as their own to ensure a fair wage for his work as an artist. Eventually, new opportunities opened up, though they began as what he called &ldquo;tokenism.&rdquo; In 1999, his cartoon on police brutality earned  <em>The Philadelphia Tribune</em>  a National Newspaper Publishers Association award for best editorial cartoon (see Figure 11). His work has been archived at his alma mater, Temple University. We use his story to highlight what Combs [<a href="#combs2015">2015</a>] refers to as the experience of being out of place both geographically and symbolically (i.e., socially and politically) and the expectation of assuming a subservient position to white people. Though Joyner did not find his place in the military, he found his place of Black respectability at church and as an educator; he also stumbled upon his place of Black resistance as a political cartoonist. These themes can be heard as Joyner retells the ways he has confronted the problems of the color line during his life (See Mr. Joyner’s oral history post including both videos and other highlights: <a href="http://www.dubois-theward.org/history/histories/samuel-joyner/">http://www.dubois-theward.org/history/histories/samuel-joyner/</a>).</p>

<h2 id="the-participatory-research-and-the-role-of-students-and-teachers">The Participatory Research and the Role of Students and Teachers</h2>
<p>Over 60 students have participated in the design and development of  <em>The WARD</em> . Through collaborations across the University of Pennsylvania and other colleges, local high schools, and churches, we have involved students from the fields of social work, history, urban studies, city planning, historic preservation, political science, public health, education, and English <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. Students received training and engaged in a collaborative research process with faculty and staff across Penn. By actively participating in each phase of the project, the students came to understand the lived experiences of Black citizens within their social environment and analyzed historical and contemporary racial patterns <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. In the process, these students shared their knowledge, developed new skills, and became empowered as co-researchers. Most notably, students collected archival records, photographs, newspapers, and digitized manuscript census data from microfilm; interviewed experts and community residents; produced documentaries; and designed the board game, walking tour, and the high school curriculum materials. The project products — particularly the Seventh Ward GIS, website, board game, walking tour guide, documentaries, and oral history collection — are evidence of the research, analytical, technological, and design skills that the students mastered and the creativity that they brought to this project.</p>
<p>The board game (see Figure 12) provides a special example of how student artistic skills and vision shaped many of  <em>The WARD</em>  curriculum material. The game requires players to assume the identity of one of eight Seventh Ward residents from the 19th Century who represented the four social classes Du Bois included in his map. We hired a student from a Philadelphia public high school as a research assistant who had studied  <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em>  in his required African American history course, and he combed through the book for facts to include in the game card questions. Jonah Taylor, then an undergraduate student, designed the board game based on maps and historical photographs of the Seventh Ward. He gave the buildings a bird’s-eye view perspective to add life to the game board, showing rooftops like Google Earth,  “playing off of contemporary visual culture”   <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To complement his computer-generated graphics, Jonah commissioned an art student at the Maryland Institute College to paint full-length portraits of the eight board game characters to incorporate into the game board and use for the game pieces. Using a limited number of available photographs and conducting extensive research about late 19th century dress, Katie Emmitt produced multiple sketches and line drawings in order to produce life-like oil paintings (Figure 13).  “It was very difficult, and it was stressful,”  she explained in a video interview,  “but it was such a good learning experience to have to put all of my effort into making something that looked real,”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. The original paintings include her lightly written notes in the corner to guide her decisions about expressions and poses. For example, Mr. Turner, a member of the working class who rented a room from Nettie Cook on South Darrien Street, had a common law marriage to Katie, a white woman who worked as a maid. On his painting, Katie Emmitt wrote proud and tired face in the top left corner.</p>

<p>Another undergraduate student research assistant, Heidi Smith, was frustrated by the moralizing tone and the lack of voices of Seventh Ward residents in  <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em>  text and primary sources such as the College Settlement Association records. Borrowing an idea from late 20th century poet Charles Reznikoff, she looked at transcripts from civil court cases to hear those missing voices and developed poems based on individual court cases <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>.  “I was wary that I would be focusing on violence or crime, because that’s what court cases are mostly concerned with and I didn’t want to give the impression that life in the Seventh Ward had only to do with violence,”  she explained in her project write-up.  “I hope you will look around and beneath the plot, to get at its implications, having to do with race, class, gender, and language in really strange ways”   <sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. One of the poems she wrote told the story of how Mr. Turner, one of the board game characters, exchanged heated words with another passenger on the trolley and then killed him in self defence when the other man followed him off the trolley and into an alley.</p>
<p>High school students, college students, and teachers have embraced this project as a novel way to recover and preserve the research of W. E. B. Du Bois and engage with a part of the Black experience that textbooks rarely cover. Our collaborations have extended to urban and suburban public schools, private middle schools, historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), private liberal arts colleges, and a state department of education. The curriculum has also expanded the opportunity to engage students as co-researchers in this project. Through the curriculum, students learn to apply social science methods as a tool for social change. Of particular note are the assignments provided during the five days. On day one, students uncover the hidden stories of a Black community once located in Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward through a 19-minute documentary. On day two, students examine a range of historical primary sources to learn and practice skills for analyzing documents to extract information and identify patterns. On day three, students learn about social science research as a systematic process of collecting information to answer questions about a community and the potential role of research for social change. On day four, students play the board game, and on day five, students use  <em>The WARD’s</em>  GIS mapping program to explore the spatial patterns of the historical Seventh Ward and learn about specific individuals who once lived there. (See  <em>The WARD</em>  curriculum: <a href="http://www.dubois-theward.org/curriculum/learning-goals/">http://www.dubois-theward.org/curriculum/learning-goals/</a>). This research project has continued to evolve with feedback from teachers, high school students, and college student researchers. Our student researchers continue to present new ways to extend Du Bois&rsquo; work while incorporating additional elements into the project. Like many emerging digital humanities projects,  <em>The WARD</em>  democratizes the creation of this research and blurs the lines between the creators and users of this research <sup id="fnref3:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. This research project also extends the kinds of transdisciplinary collaborations possible.</p>
<h2 id="how-philadelphia-and-the-seventh-ward-have-changed">How Philadelphia and the Seventh Ward have changed</h2>
<p>Once the largest Black community in Philadelphia, itself the Northern city with the largest Black population at the turn of the 20th century, the Seventh Ward has lost most of its Black residents even while the Black population in Philadephia has increased ten-fold. The Black middle class was drawn to new row houses in West and North Philadelphia — and to a lesser extent, the inner-ring suburbs — while lower-income households found new opportunities in the segregated public housing developments across the city <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. Gentrification, broadly speaking, and the threat of a crosstown expressway, specifically, led Black people to forgo Center City as the heart of residential, religious, and cultural life. An area that was once 28% Black is now dominated by upper-middle-class white people; only 7% of current residents identify as Black or African American <sup id="fnref13:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Numerous historic markers stand as reminders of the lives and institutions of the Black communities in the Seventh Ward; memorialized are the intellectual and activist Octavius Catto, the Institute for Colored Youth, and Engine Company 11. At the edge of the Seventh Ward, Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church — acquired by Richard Allen in 1794 — remains the longest-held Black property in the nation.</p>
<p>Maps comparing the distribution of the Black population in 1900 to that of 2020 show two distinct patterns (see Figures 14 and 15). First, the Black population outnumbers white, Hispanic/Latino and Asian groups. Second, Black people are concentrated in areas outside the historical Center City and Seventh Ward, making up a majority of residents for a wide section of the city stretching from due north of downtown to the far reaches of Southwest Philadelphia. If one were to study the Philadelphia Negro, today, the historical 32nd Ward in North Philadelphia might be the more appropriate focus. Anchored by institutions such as Temple University and historic congregations such as the Church of the Advocate and Zion Baptist Church. Racial residential patterns over the past 50 years have demonstrated a level of racial segregation unknown to people living in Philadelphia at the end of the 20th century. Recent maps show how gentrification has spread to neighborhoods north and south of the old Seventh Ward, further displacing Black communities that once found refuge there <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-the-ward">Limitations of The WARD</h2>
<p>Despite the advantages that the 1900 U.S. census records provide over the original data Du Bois collected, there are numerous limitations of this re-creation. Most importantly, Du Bois gathered much more information than the census enumerators because his interview schedules were more detailed, including questions about health, previous occupations, experience with racial discrimination, income, housing, and neighborhood conditions. In addition, the 1900 U.S. census was conducted three years after Du Bois conducted his study, so there is no guarantee that it included the same people. Finally, a paid enumerator — not a trained researcher of Du Bois&rsquo; caliber — collected the census, so the data are likely not of comparable reliability and validity. In fact, the  <em>Philadelphia Press <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup></em>  reported in June 1900, while the census was being collected, that two census enumerators were fired for drunkenness. Still, these data provide the best approximation of Du Bois&rsquo; survey results and offer great insight into what Du Bois found when he came to Philadelphia — and how he conducted his research.</p>
<p>The GIS re-creation of Du Bois&rsquo; map indicates that the 2,500 households Du Bois interviewed lived at approximately 1,400 properties. The property lines for the GIS parcel layer do not correspond perfectly to the property lines on Du Bois&rsquo; map, primarily because they are based on different Bromley fire insurance maps. Also, some of the properties that Du Bois marked as Black households had white residents in 1900, according to the census. This was the case for at least 60 properties. Of the 1,400 properties, 70 appear to have been owner-occupied by Black people, consistent with Du Bois&rsquo; estimate that only 5% of Black Seventh Ward residents owned their own homes. We included the walking tour and mural in this project as we recognize there is no substitute for returning to the neighborhood and retracing Du Bois’ steps to discover what remains of the Seventh Ward, particularly how this neighborhood helps us to understand the ways the color line changed over time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Through our digital humanities project,  <em>The WARD</em> , we continue a search to understand the universality and uniqueness of W. E. B. Du Bois&rsquo; research. In particular, we seek to document the patterns of the lives of Black people at the end of the 19th century and compare those patterns to the experiences of Black people today. Like Du Bois, we found that denying Black humanity takes many forms and ultimately affects the place of Black people in education, employment, housing, civic life, and other sectors.</p>
<p>Over 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Congressman John Lewis, and others marching for civil rights, greater equality in voting, education, housing, and other practices confronted firehoses, dogs, violence, verbal abuse, and even threats by the Ku Klux Klan. Their courage helped to outlaw codified and sanctioned racist practices. Today, students benefit from the progress made by changes in policies and practices in voting, housing, education, and employment. They have, however, only pieces of the racialized history pre-dating the Civil Rights movement to help them better understand the world they inherited. This leaves them unprepared to fully understand the context for the deaths of Black citizens during police encounters, challenges to voting rights, and other problems of the color line.</p>
<p>The  <em>WARD</em>  engages students in this research project to help them remember our past and critically consider what they can do about the color line today. Ultimately, we hope that revisiting Du Bois&rsquo; work will help the next generation find alternative ways of thinking about race and addressing both interpersonal and structural forms of racism. The coronavirus pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd in 2020 have laid bare the persistent racism in our systems (e.g., persistent patterns of racial segregation; limited access to health care, healthy foods, and reliable transportation; concentrated poverty; lack of affordable housing) <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. These times call for community-engaged and participatory research projects like  <em>The WARD</em>  to move us closer to our democratic ideal, one that recognizes the full humanity of all people as created equal and endowed with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<p>Developing better methods of classifying short texts is becoming increasingly important in the field of computational stylometrics. Synoptic work (Eder 2015) suggests that many common approaches to at least one kind of text classification — Authorship Attribution — are unreliable when the text to be classified is less than a few thousand words. Maciej Eder’s study examines several classifiers (Burrows’ Delta, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor) and finds that all suffer from a similar drop in effectiveness as the size of the target texts decreases. The same result is seen when considering the most usual independent variables (a.k.a. features) used as input to the various classifiers. These features include Most Frequent Words, character n-grams, and POS (part of speech) n-grams. Based on Eder’s results, one must conclude that success in classification of short texts needs improved algorithms and/or more informative input variables.</p>
<p>This study focuses on the second requirement and explores the value of morphological tagging and syntactic parsing to create a richly discriminative set of variables. Generally speaking, morphological and syntactic data are underused in Authorship Attribution as compared to lexical and character-based features. While a wide-ranging survey <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was able to refer to a number of studies that used syntactic re-write rules or more complex morpho-syntactic features, an examination of references in a subsequent overview <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> indicates POS tags are almost the only such features in frequent use. However, a more recent experiment in Authorship Attribution relying entirely on morpho-syntactic variables <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> suggests that such features can significantly enrich the information available for text classification.</p>
<p>The general applicability of R. Gorman’s study is questionable for at least two reasons. First, it involves a morphologically complex language — ancient Greek. It is uncertain how its methods may be suited to a simpler morphological target such as English. Second, the study’s approach is based on a dependency syntax corpus in which morphology and dependency relations have been hand annotated by a single language expert. The corpus is unusually large to be annotated in this way, and the resulting accuracy and consistency is a luxury available in few languages.</p>
<p>The present investigation will further explore the viability of a morpho-syntactic approach to text classification. It will test the effectiveness of such variables in several languages representing a wide spectrum of morphological complexity (English, German, Spanish, Finnish, and Polish). In addition, the requisite morphological and dependency annotation will be generated automatically, using a freely available program. As a proof of concept, classification will be carried out with only the resultant morpho-syntactic information. This restriction will simplify interpretation of results by reducing possible confounding elements within the proposed feature set. In addition, an important consideration in authorship classification is to eliminate as far as possible the effects of topic and genre and to avoid relying on any features that could be easily imitated or manipulated. Syntactic features are thought to meet this requirement better than lexical ones. Since identifying syntactic information requires extra processing with possibly noisy results, most investigations fall back on function words as a proxy for truly syntactic features. By directly using computationally generated syntactic analyses instead, this study will explore the benefits of such pre-processing in comparison to the costs of the noise it inevitably introduces.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article has the following structure. Part 2 discusses the formation of the various language corpora. It then details the creation of the input variables. These variables are somewhat complicated, in that they are based on combinations of morpho-syntactic elements and, at the same time, seek to preserve as much flexibility as possible in the incorporation of these elements. Part 3 explains the several steps of the classification experiment itself. Part 4 presents the results of the classification process and explores their implications. It lays particular emphasis on the interpretability of the input variables used in this study. Arguably, descriptions of authorial style based on traditional morpho-syntactic categories will prove more persuasive to those outside the ranks of scholars of computational stylometrics.</p>
<h2 id="2-corpora-and-feature-extraction">2. Corpora and Feature Extraction</h2>
<p>This study involves corpora of texts in several languages: English, Finnish, German, Spanish, and Polish. An attempt was made to gather publicly available texts in a wider range of languages, but it was hindered by several factors. The design of the proposed experiment requires 20 single-author texts in a given language. All texts should be more than 20,000 tokens in length, and all texts in a language should be of the same type. Where possible, texts were to be drawn from a well-defined temporal range. These demands were most easily met by selecting works of fiction, in particular novels. The works were drawn from Project Gutenberg and the Computational Stylistics Group.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>It may be surprising that a study interested in classification of short texts would use novels rather than, for example, tweets or news articles. However, the focus here is on the informational value of morpho-syntactic variables in various languages and not on any particular kind of text, and in this case the reasons for choosing novels are fairly compelling. As noted, the literature suggests that classification of more than a few texts becomes ineffective when the targets are shorter than a few thousand words. Thus, our investigation starts with texts c. 2000 words. Since data are traditionally split into a training set comprising approximately 90% of the material, with the remainder in the test set, texts of 20,000 words are in order. While it might be possible to manufacture texts of this length by concatenating tweets or the like, it would not be easy to find, for a range of languages, large sets of short texts that meet a second requirement: that single authorship of each 20,000-word text group can be assumed. Third, the use of novels minimizes, at least as compared to concatenated collections, possible confounding effects of genre and topic.</p>
<p>The core of this investigation is variable extraction and preparation. The first step is to generate morpho-syntactic annotations for each text. The processing is done with the udpipe package for the R Software Environment <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The package includes functions to produce a universal dependency grammar analysis for texts in a wide variety of languages. Dependency grammar is an increasingly widely accepted approach to describing the structure of sentences. It offers an advantage to the present study in that, unlike phrase structure grammars, it deals well with non-projective grammatical sentence components — essentially, words closely related grammatically that are separated from each other by less closely related words. Non-projectivity occurs frequently in many languages, especially those which, unlike English, have a relatively complex system of morphology. The <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/">Universal Dependencies</a> framework <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> has been developed by an international cooperative of scholars to further cross-linguistic language study. One of its most important contributions is to establish a common set of tags for morphological features and syntactic relationships. This standard is a great step forward in natural language processing across languages, since, inter alia, the parsers (i.e., programs to analyze syntax) sponsored by the Universal Dependencies (UD) project produce mutually compatible output: a single algorithm can pre-process texts from a range of languages.</p>
<p>Raw text (.txt files) provided to the udpipe program gives an output in which each token is lemmatized, tagged for morphology, and parsed for universal dependency relationship. Formatted as a matrix, its most salient results look like this:<br>
udpipe Annotation.    token_id  token  lemma  upos      1  Er  er  PRON      2  lachte  lachen  VERB      3  vor  vor  ADP      4  Vergnügen  Vergnügen  NOUN      5  ,  ,  PUNCT      6  sich  er|es|sie  PRON      7  über  über  ADP      8  den  der  DET      9  Katechismus  Katechismus  NOUN      10  mokieren  mokieren  VERB      11  zu  zu  PART      12  können  können  AUX        udpipe Annotation (continued)    token_id  feats  head_token_id  dep_rel      1  Case=Nom|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing|Person=3|PronType=Prs  2  nsubj      2  Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin  0  root      3  Case=Nom|Gender=Neut|Number=Plur  4  case      4  Case=Nom|Gender=Neut|Number=Sing  2  obl      5  NA  10  punct      6  Case=Acc|Number=Sing|Person=3|PronType=Prs|Reflex=Yes  10  obj      7  Foreign=Yes  9  case      8  Case=Acc|Definite=Def|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing|PronType=Art  9  det      9  Case=Acc|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing  10  obl      10  VerbForm=Inf  4  xcomp      11  Case=Nom|Definite=Ind|Gender=Neut|Number=Sing|PronType=Ind  10  mark      12  VerbForm=Inf  10  aux   <br>
The text is part of a sentence from  <em>Buddenbrooks</em>  by Thomas Mann:  “ Er lachte vor Vergnügen, sich über den Katechismus mokieren zu können … ”  ( “He laughed with pleasure at being able to make fun of the catechism” ).</p>
<p>For each token the analysis gives the form as it appears in the text and its lemma. This information is not used in our approach to classification and will be ignored here. The remaining columns shown, however, are integral. The upos column contains the UD part-of-speech tags for each word. The feats column gives the morphological analysis. Morphology information has the form TYPE=VALUE, with multiple features separated by a bar symbol (TYPE1=VALUE1|TYPE2=VALUE2). For example, token #2,  <em>lachte</em>  (laughed), is identified as Indicative in the category Mood (Mood=Ind), Singular in the category Number (Number=Sing), etc. There is no limit to the number of features that may be assigned to a single token.</p>
<p>Part of speech and morphology constitute what we may call shallow syntactic features. Information of this type may allow us to infer some syntactical structures, but they do not represent them directly. In contrast, the head_token_id and dep_rel columns do constitute such a direct representation. The head token is the item that is the immediate syntactic parent of a given token. The dependency relation specifies the type of grammatical structure obtaining between parent and target. From these columns we may generate a description of the syntactic structure of the entire sentence in a representation of its deep syntax. The structure revealed by these data points is perhaps most clearly illustrated with the corresponding dependency tree:</p>

</figure>
<p>As is apparent, the syntactic path from the sentence root to the each leaf token is given by the combination of head id and dependency relationship.</p>
<p>Both shallow and deep syntactic information are used to create the input variables for this investigation. Before looking at those variables in detail, it is worth noticing that pre-processing with the udpipe program introduces a certain amount of noise through mistaken analyses. To focus on the feats output, token 4, the noun  _ Vergnügen _ , is incorrectly assigned NOMINATIVE case (should be DATIVE). In addition, the three indeclinable tokens in this text — i.e., words with a fixed and static form whose morphology is usually not further analyzed — are treated very strangely indeed: the preposition  _ vor _  and the particle  _ zu _  are assigned gender, number, and case ( _ zu _  also gets classified for definiteness and pronoun type). The frequent preposition  _ über _  is treated as a foreign word, perhaps as a dependent of the ecclesiastical (and ultimately ancient Greek) word  _ Katechismus _ . Whatever the reason, the parser has introduced 4 errors in 12 tokens. Of course, the example text was chosen because it is short yet relatively complex; it may not be at all representative of the general error rate of the udpipe program. Nonetheless, it would be reasonable to worry that the noise introduced by erroneous morpho-syntactic annotations would undercut their value for classification input variables. However, as we will see below, bad tagging and parsing seems to make little or no practical difference in the classification results. We may evidently assume that these input errors are distributed randomly across the classified texts and that they have little effect as compared to the information carried by the input variables.</p>
<p>To turn now to the details of the features (i.e., input variables) themselves, there are two main principles guiding their creation: first, the set should include both shallow and deep syntactic information; second, the degrees of freedom present in the morpho-syntactic system of the target language should be, to the greatest extent possible, preserved and represented in the features.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The first criterion is met by including, alongside the morphological information for each word, its dependency relation and, for each word that is not a sentence root, the morphology and dependency relation for the parent word of the target word. To illustrate from the German sentence given above, the variables for the word  _ Katechismus _  would include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self: POS = noun, case = accusative, gender = masculine, number = singular, dependency = oblique</li>
<li>Parent: POS = verb, verb form = infinitive, dependency = open clausal complement</li>
</ul>
<p>Including values for parent as well as target word creates a representation of the hierarchical structure that most linguistic theories assume for syntax. Of course, the dimensions of morpho-syntactic information produced by the udpipe tagger-parser vary sharply by language. The following table (Table 4) indicates the number of basic elements for each language.<br>
Number of Simplex Variables      target token  target + parent      English  16  32      Finnish  23  46      German  15  30      Polish  33  66      Spanish  18  36   <br>
The second requirement mentioned above is meant to preserve the complexity of the morpho-syntax of the input texts. As we have noted, it is rare for an attribution attempt to take any morphological feature into account with the common exception of part of speech. In those studies that do include morphological details, the various values that make up the relevant information about a word seem to be coded in a single block. For example, Paulo Varela et al. (2018, 2016) incorporate in their variables a vector for flexion (number, gender, tense, etc.), but apparently combine the features of a word into a single value: thus the entry for  _é _ (Portuguese is) is reported as PR 3S IND VFIN, i.e, present indicative 3rd-person singular verb.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Combining the morphological categories of a word into a single value obscures some of the stylistic information that the word may contain. For example, if we categorize a German noun into a consolidated unit of gender, number, and case (e.g., Masc Sing Nom), the computer can assign each noun in the corpus to one of the 24 resulting categories (3 genders x 2 numbers x 4 cases) and calculate a frequency distribution over them, but it cannot access the frequencies of, say, masculine nouns or of combinations of two categories such as feminine dative, etc.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  There is no strong reason to presume that any frequency ratio among the ternary variables is more discriminative for the texts in a corpus than, e.g., the ratio between Masc Nom and Fem Nom. We may usefully think of the morpho-syntactic elements that make up combinations as characters in syntactic n-grams.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  Just as the addition to word-based inputs of character n-grams with different values of  <em>n</em>  may improve classification, in the same way using a range of combination lengths for morpho-syntactic elements may be valuable. Thus, it is best  _in principle, _ to include variables made of all arities of morpho-syntactic categories, from one to the total number of such categories (i.e.,           n      1          …          n      n          ).<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, such an extensive variable set is not feasible  <em>in practice.</em>  For example, the udpipe program for German returns 13 categories of morphological features. To these 13 must be added the part of speech and the dependency relationship, and since the characteristics of the parent word are to be combined with those of each target word, variable types will be combinations constructed from 30 categories. If all sizes of combination were included (i.e.,           30      1          …          30      30          ), the number of types would be essentially       2      30      —over a billion separate combinations! Nor is the combinatorial explosion the only problem. Each of the       2      30          combinations is a type, not a variable. We have seen that the ternary combination Gender-Number-Case may take one of 24 different values in German: MASC SING NOM, etc. Thus, the number of type-value pairs reaches truly astronomical values. Clearly, we must combine the generation of input features with a rigorous culling and reduction process.</p>
<p>The first step deals with the combinatorial dimension. Selecting grammatically sensible combinations such as Gender-Number-Case (and its unigram and bigram components) would be laborious and would require knowledge of the various languages to be classified. Thus, a naïve approach was preferred: an arbitrary maximum length was chosen. Given a set of 30 elements for combination, the length must necessarily be short.     ∑    k  =  1          4                30      k             already gives 31,930 unique combinations. When we take into account that each combination will have multiple values, trouble with data sparsity and computational limitations can be expected. Therefore, the maximum was set at three elements per combination. This limit results in 4,525 combinations.</p>
<p>The next step populates each combination (or variable type) with its various values, as drawn from the basic morpho-syntactic elements produced by udpipe. This process is computationally slow for combinations of more than two elements, so we have used a smaller sample corpus for each language; it is composed of 500 tokens (punctuation excluded) from each text. When populated, the various combinations of types exhibit a large number of unique values. To take German as illustrative: the 30 unary types produce 161 values, the 435 binary types produce 5,579 values, and the 4,060 ternary combinations yield 56,349 values. As one would expect with linguistic data, the frequency distributions of these values are quite skewed. For example, 53,209 of the ternary values occur in 1% or fewer words and 19,116 occur only once in the sample corpus of 10,000 tokens. To avoid severe sparsity, another culling of variables is clearly in order.</p>
<p>Once again, since we do not know without prior investigation which combinations may be most distinctive for authors and texts, we have had recourse to a naïve approach. For each combination length, only those type-value pairs that occur in 5% of the tokens in the sample corpus have been included as input variables for classification. A separate set of variables has been identified in this way for each language. The size of each sub-set of variables is given in the following table (Table 3).<br>
Number of Variable Subsets with at Least 5% Frequency      unary  binary  ternary  total      English  45  61  85  191      Finnish  48  226  467  932      German  58  216  318  592      Polish  63  331  726  1,120      Spanish  46  150  189  385   <br>
Because the variables may be difficult to conceptualize, the following tables give an illustration, including, for selected languages, the most frequent type-value pair as well as the least frequent pair to make the 5% minimum. Examples will be given in each category for target word characteristics (marked t:), parent word characteristics (marked “p:”), and combinations of target and parent (Tables 4, 5, and 6).<br>

It is important to emphasize that it is the  <em>pairing</em>  of the (possibly compound) types  _and _ their (possibly compound) values which constitute the input variables for this investigation. In Polish, for example, a type combining the Number of the target word, with the part of speech and dependency relation of the target word’s parent can have many possible values. But only those combinations of values that occur no less often than the 5% frequency of Singular-Verb-conjunct have been taken into account. All less frequent values for this type have been excluded from the variables and ignored.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>This generation and selection of variables produce, for each text in a language corpus, a matrix in which each row represents a token of the text and each column represents a type-value pair as described above. The total number of variable columns differs for each language (see Table 4). For each row, each cell is assigned a value of one if the token has the morpho-syntactic characteristic for that column; otherwise, zero is assigned. The design of the variables means any given token can have positive values in numerous columns. The German corpus, for example, has a mean of 48.8 positive columns per token (of a total 592 variables).</p>
<h2 id="3-classification">3. Classification</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to test whether automated Universal Dependency annotation, as supplied by the udpipe program, can be useful for authorship attribution and related problems. It seeks to understand whether such an input contains enough information to overcome the noise introduced by a level of mistakes, which can be relatively high as compared to the results of expert  “hand annotation.”  Since it is known that the information/noise ratio worsens for shorter input texts <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>, this investigation focuses on the degree to which classification performance degrades as the size of the input decreases. This process requires texts of various lengths, with all other factors held constant, insofar as this may be possible. This requirement is met by creating a series of smaller texts for each author by sampling the full text.</p>
<p>At each stage of classification, each text in each language corpus was divided into smaller texts, and these smaller units were classified according to author. <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> has shown that — at least for expert-annotated ancient Greek prose — classification on the basis of combinations of morpho-syntactic characteristics is practically error-free for input texts larger than 500 tokens (&gt; 99%). Exploratory tests for our study confirm this high level of accuracy for text sizes of between 2000 and 600 tokens. Thus, this paper will present only the data for the smallest texts in the investigation; it begins with texts of 500 tokens, and then decreases to 400, 300, 200, 100, and finally 50 tokens.</p>
<p>As is traditional in textual attribution studies, each text was treated as a bag of words for the purpose of division into samples. Each token was — naively — treated as independent of all others; no further account was taken of the context of an individual token in sentence, paragraph, or any other unit of composition. Thus, segments may contain tokens from many parts of the original text without regard for their original order.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Once segments of the appropriate length have been generated, the next step is to aggregate the values for all variables in each segment. For example, a matrix with 20,000 rows representing as many separate tokens, each with a 1 or a 0 in its variable columns, is replaced by a new matrix with 40 rows, each representing 500 tokens. Each variable column now contains the sum of the relevant column for the underlying tokens. Columns values are then normalized so that sums are replaced by relative frequencies. These segment matrices become the input for the classifying algorithm.</p>
<p>To present a difficult classification problem <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>, each language corpus contains one work apiece by 20 different authors. Given the number of suitable texts available in the public domain, this number represent an attempt to balance between including more languages with fewer authors for each and including fewer languages with more authors in each.</p>
<p>For the classification algorithm itself, logistic regression was chosen. This method has an ability to handle a large number of observations and variables. It is also able to function well in the presence of many co-linear variables. Specifically, the  <em>LiblineaR</em>  package for the  _R Project for Statistical Computing _ was chosen <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. This package offers a range of linear methods; we selected the L-2 regularization option for logistic regression.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>
<p>For each input text size in each language, 90% of the data was used for training the classifier and the remaining 10% set aside for testing. Inclusion of a segment in the training or testing set was random. However, the amount of text by individual authors in some language corpora varies a great deal, and this situation may affect results, with the classifier, for example, strongly preferring the most frequent author in the training set. Thus, the random assignment into training and test sets was guided by associating a selection probability with each segment so that each of the  <em>n</em>  authors in a corpus was represented by approximately       1      n       of the segments in the test set. This balance prevents undue bias in the classifier. To validate the results of the classification testing, we used Monte Carlo subsampling <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> applied at two levels. As a rule, the populating of the segments with randomly selected tokens was carried out ten times.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  For each of these partitionings to create text segments, 100 additional random divisions into a training set and a test set were made. As noted below, because the classification process becomes much slower as text size falls, fewer iterations of both kinds of subsampling were used for the smallest segments. The results of the tests at each text size were averaged. These steps minimize the effects of the internal make-up of particular segments or of their inclusion or exclusion from the training/testing groups.</p>
<h2 id="4-results-and-discussion">4. Results and Discussion</h2>
<p>For each language corpus, the results of classification according to the size of the input text segments are given in Table 8. Since the goal of this study is to evaluate for authorship attribution the sufficiency of machine-generated Universal Dependency data, no consideration is given to various specialized measurements of classification success. Instead, the simplest measure of accuracy is used: percentage of successful attributions. The mean accuracy over all attempts is given in the top row of each cell; the range is given below the mean.<br>
Classification Accuracy      500  400  300  200  100  50      Polish   99.35 (95.8-100)     99.05 (95.3-100)     98.18 (94.5-100)     96.28 (92.7-99.3)     88.32 (84.3-92.0)     74.19 (71.0-78.5)         Finnish   99.52 (99.3-99.7)     99.03 (98.7-99.3)     98.15 (97.8-98.4)     95.56 (95.1-96.0)     86.44 (85.8-86.9)     70.61 (70.2-71.1)        Spanish   98.87 (98.7-99.0)     98.25 (98.0-98.4)     96.75 (96.4-97.0)     93.18 (92.8-93.5)     81.2 (80.6-81.6)     61.7 (61.6-62.0)        German   96.7 (93.2-99.2)     95.4 (91.6-98.4)     92.85 (87.9-95.5)     87.99 (84.8-91.1)     76.95 (71.7-83.0)     56.07 (54.5-58.2)        English   98.26 (96.4-99.8)     97.25 (94.0-99.4)     94.75 (92.5-97.5)     89.7 (87.3-92.6)     74.45 (71.6-77.4)     53.8 (51.6-55.9)     <br>
These data make clear that morpho-syntactic variables derived from UD automated parsing suffice to identify author/work in a closed set of authors with a single work for each. For all tested languages, accuracy is greater than 90% with text segments larger than 300 tokens. Each language corpus contains 20 classes for attribution; 90% accuracy is roughly 18 times random chance since the no-information rate for each iteration varies slightly from 5%.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  Such success offers promise for the feasibility of classification when vocabulary- and/or character-based variables are not appropriate.</p>
<p>A few more specific observations about these results are in order. In general, accuracy tracks well with the size of the variable set for each language (see Table 4). Languages with larger sets tend to have better accuracy. We may reasonably presume that this tendency is due in part to the correlation between the number of variables and the sparsity of the input matrices. Ordinarily, we expect sparsity — the number of cells of a matrix containing zeros — to increase as the number of variables becomes greater. And more sparsity in data for natural language processing usually means less accuracy. However, recall that in this study a single token may have positive values for many variables and that any variable which has positive values for fewer than 5% of tokens has been excluded. The combination of these two factors means that as the number of total variables increases, so too does the number of variables per token (Table 9). When the token matrices are aggregated to form representations of texts of various lengths, the variable columns are summed. The presence of positive values in a good number of columns in the original matrix makes it unsurprising when relatively few columns in the aggregated matrix sum to 0. We may illustrate this with the example of Spanish. The average token in the Spanish matrix has 34.7 columns with a positive value. Forming, e.g., a 50-token segment by the aggregation of the matrix rows means that, on average, 1,735 (34.7 × 50) positive values will be distributed among the 385 variable columns in the resulting matrix. It stands to reason that, all else being equal, we may expect relatively few aggregated columns containing zeros. In fact, with the variables used in this study, sparsity is almost non-existent for texts larger than 100 tokens; the sparsity rates for 50-token texts are themselves unexpectedly small given the number of variables (Table 9). This low sparsity may go far to explaining the good accuracy of the classification experiment.<br>
Sparsity       Variable types total     Mean Variables Per token     Sparsity @50 tks.        Polish  1,120  102.9  5.8%      Finnish  932  69.7  3.8%      Spanish  385  34.7  3.4%      German  592  48.0  5.5%      English  191  16.7  5.0%   <br>
A second aspect of the accuracy results reported in Table 3 needs closer elaboration. As is usual for author attribution studies that take text size into consideration, results in each language show a monotonic decline in accuracy as text size decreases. However, when viewed from the perspective of relative error rates, our morpho-syntactic variables seem quite robust against decreasing text size.</p>
<p>When considering classification accuracy of a range of text sizes, it is important to focus on the relationship between the change in accuracy and the change in text size. A 5% decrease in accuracy when text size drops from 2000 tokens to 1900 tokens is much more worrisome than the same decrease from 2000 to 1000 tokens. Table 10 gives the relevant information for this experiment. Specifically, it records the rates at which the error rate (1 – Accuracy) for each language increases as the text size is repeatedly halved: 400 to 200 tokens, 200 to 100, and 100 to 50.<br>
Change in Error Rate by Text Size      200/400  100/200  50/100      Polish   0.0372/.0095 = 3.92      0.1168/.0372 = 3.13      0.2581/0.1168 = 2.2         Finnish   0.044/0.0097 = 4.57      0.1356/0.044 = 3.05      0.2939/0.1356 = 2.16         Spanish   0.0682/0.0175 = 3.89      0.188/0.0682 = 2.75      0.383/0.188 = 2.03         German   0.1201/.046 = 2.61      0.2305/0.1201 = 1.91      0.4393/0.2305 = 1.90         English   0.103/0.0275 = 3.74      0.2555/0.103 = 2.48      0.462/0.2555 = 1.81      <br>
The first row in each cell gives the error rate for a given text size divided by the error rate for the text that is double the size. For example, the Polish 200-token corpus had an average error rate of 3.72%, which is divided by the average error rate for the Polish 400-token corpus, 0.95%. The second line of the cell gives the corresponding result: while the text size decreases by a factor of 2, the error rate increases by a factor of 3.92. An overview of this table shows that for all languages the increase factor becomes significantly smaller as the input size itself decreases. While the absolute accuracy (or error) rate is still quite properly the metric of interest for literary and, most especially, forensic attribution methods, clearly presenting proportional relationships such as that of the rate of change in text size viz-à-viz the change in success rate should help us to better judge the effectiveness of different approaches to classification of small texts.</p>
<p>There are, of course, anomalies in the patterns observable in Table 8. For example, since the German matrix has both more total variables and more variables per token than does the Spanish, we might reasonably expect classification of German would outperform Spanish. This is not the case. Nor can an explanation be offered here.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  We can only note that some of the differences between the success rates of various languages must be due not to characteristics of the morpho-syntactic variables, but to particularities of the language corpora. Although an effort was made, within the limits of the texts available in the public domain, to assemble corpora that were roughly similar among languages, important aspects of the corpora must necessarily differ. It is inevitable, for example, that one corpus contains a higher proportion of texts that are more difficult to distinguish from each other than does another corpus. It is possible that this advantage, then, is so great that it may significantly affect the classification accuracy rates. Another complicating factor is introduced by the relative effectiveness of the udpipe annotation. Again, we must assume a possibly wide range between the most and the least accurate of the annotation algorithms. Accordingly, a relatively large amount of noise in the variables of an individual language may certainly be expected to suppress classification accuracy.</p>
<p>However, identifying such possible confounding elements and measuring their effects are not germane to the purpose of this study. Our experiments have been designed to test the hypothesis that machine-generated morpho-syntactic annotation can be used for accurate closed-set attribution, even for fairly small texts, in a range of languages. All comparisons among languages are merely illustrative and suggestive: greater morpho-syntactic complexity seems to correlate at least approximately with accuracy. Detailed investigation of this apparent relationship must be left to experts in the respective languages and literatures.</p>
<p>This investigation has set out to explore the discriminative value of a certain set of input features. It has advanced the hypothesis that, absent any vocabulary data, a mixture of a text’s shallow and deep morpho-syntactic characteristics, when combined in a way that preserves as many degrees of freedom as possible, can produce strong results in closed-set classification. These results are significant, insomuch as most text classification methods rely primarily on vocabulary or character information, with a text’s syntax represented only by function words and POS tags. However, the quantitative study of language and texts has recently seen the rise in prominence of approaches such as deep neural networks. These are often end to end learning systems; input consists of raw text with little pre-processing and no feature extraction. Results can be amazingly accurate. In the presence of such effective alternatives, the reader of this study may reasonably feel doubts about a method which requires syntactic parsing as well as significant effort given to feature engineering.</p>
<p>Yet, user-specified input features have their own advantages. The continuing efforts to find better methods of text classification is primarily driven, at least in the various disciplines of the humanities, by the desire to identify and describe the essential features of individual style. Investigations seek to confirm (or refute) the hypothesis that every user of language has a stylistic fingerprint or signature that allows written or spoken texts from that source to be distinguished from all others. In order for studies of this sort to be plausible, however accurate the results may be, we must be able to give a clear interpretation for the variables on which the classification depends.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  Optimally, we must give this interpretation in terms of commonly accepted phenomena of language and communication. Generally speaking, hand-crafted input features meet this criterion. In contrast, end-to-end deep learning algorithms typically abstract their own features, and often it takes a great deal of effort to establish what phenomena the model is taking into account.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>
<p>The input features examined in this study are familiar in their basic elements and transparently interpretable. Anyone interested in the dimensions of authorial style presented here can quickly learn the outline of a language’s morphology and the elementary structures of Universal Dependency grammar. As a result, classification based on UD parsing and morphology tagging puts even beginning students of style in a position to explore clear distinctions between texts and authors.</p>
<p>Since even a classification technique as fundamental as logistic regression complicates the matter by adding a layer of learned weights to the input features, the interpretability of these morpho-syntactic variables is well illustrated if looked at through the lens of a simple distance measure. Since its publication, Burrows’s Delta has become one of the most widely used metrics for comparing text styles. In essence, Delta measures, for each feature of interest, how far the target text differs from the mean of the corpus, normalized by the standard deviation of each variable.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  In spite of its simplicity, Delta can produce very good classification results <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Conveniently, classification by this method is included in the Stylo package for R <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>. Table 11 demonstrates the effectiveness of our morpho-syntactic variables by showing the results for the classification of 33 Polish novels using Stylo.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><br>

Clearly, the variables used in this study can accurately distinguish texts without the addition of weights and calculations that may obscure interpretation. A very few brief examples should suffice to make this point.</p>
<p>According to the application of Burrows’s Delta to the morpho-syntactic variables presented here, the two stylistically most distinct works in our corpus of English fiction are James Fenimore Cooper’s  _The Last of the Mohicans _ (1826) and Mark Twain’s  _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn _ (1885). The most distinctive feature in the set (where the two authors differ by almost four standard deviations) is Cooper’s fondness for an oblique dependent of a verb that itself is modified by its own dependent. In UD grammar, the oblique of a verb is a nominal dependent of a verb that is not an argument of the verb. Here is an example from Cooper’s first paragraph:  “The hardy colonist, and the trained European who fought at his side ….”  Here,  _side _ in at his side is an oblique of  _fought _ and is modified by its dependent possessive  _his. _ If the annotations created by udpipe are to be trusted, Cooper used such structures to an unusual degree, while Twain avoided them. Comparing Cooper to the entire English corpus, we find that the author was also inordinately fond of modifying the object of a verb with a dependency.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  The unusually high frequency of this construction remains even if we control for the number of objects in general, as well as when we consider the total frequency of all verbs.</p>
<p>To examine a morphologically more complex language, in our German corpus the work with the greatest mean distance to all the others is Arthur Achleitner’s  _Im grünen Tann _ (1897?). One of the strongest  _differentiae _ is the author’s marked preference for verbs in the Present Indicative Active 3rd-person Singular. Because the data set contains values for simple morphological elements as well as combination, we can quickly see that Achleitner’s verbal tendency can be explained in terms of his very sharp relative avoidance of past tense verbs, alongside a more moderate relative deficit of plural verbs; we may assume that mood, voice, and person do not play a significant role in this stylistic peculiarity. With respect to nominal forms, Achleitner shows a relatively high number of nouns with a dependent definite article; this frequency is only partly explained by the relative number of nouns in general. At the same time, the frequency of pronouns is much lower than average. Accordingly, we might formulate, perhaps for our students, a “thumbnail” outline of Achleitner’s stylistic quirks: he loves  <em>liebt</em>  and hates  <em>liebte</em> ; loves  <em>der, die, das</em>  and hates  <em>er, sie, es.</em>  It is a gross simplification to be sure, but it emphasizes the transparency of stylistic distinctions drawn on the basis of our feature set.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the evidence presented in this study has shown that morpho-syntactic features can form a basis for the successful classification of texts. Results are good across languages ranging from the morphologically complex (e.g., Polish) to the simple (e.g., English). And, while it is unlikely that the frequency of morpho-syntactic elements is unaffected by topic, genre, etc., we can reasonably suppose that it is less affected by such elements external to the author than are variables based primarily on aspects of vocabulary. Therefore, morpho-syntactic features seem essential to characterizing an author’s stylistic signature.</p>
<p>A second goal of the present work has been to demonstrate that we do not need to rely on expensive expert-annotated data to provide satisfactory syntactic information. Automated parsers such as udpipe are able to output Universal Dependency annotation that is sufficient to form the basis of effective variables representing both the shallow and deep syntax of a text. Because, with most variable sets used in the attribution literature, noise tends to overwhelm information when text size decreases sufficiently, this investigation has focused on short texts. Even with texts of 50 tokens, accuracy remains many times better than random chance (74%-53%). These results were achieved with the most naïve methods of feature selection and without any optimization of the parsing or classifying algorithms. We may thus suggest that further explorations of the value of UD parsing for classification promise to be productive.</p>
<p>Finally, we have argued that the morpho-syntactic features discussed here are advantageous, at least from the point of view of interpretability and pedagogical usefulness. Unlike n-grams, for example, morpho-syntactic variables represent traditional grammatical terms and categories. Unlike function words, such variables — at least when the preservation of degrees of freedom is emphasized in their construction — contain information based on every word in a text. As a result, stylistic traits formulated in terms of these variables are easily identified and illustrated in a way relatively more likely to be persuasive in the classroom or in the pages of a specialized literary journal.</p>
<p>In sum, this investigation of short text classification on the basis of machine-generated Universal Dependency annotation indicates that, at the very least, morpho-syntax should occupy a larger role in the future development of text attribution. Perhaps it should even take a central role.</p>

<p>Here the metaphor degrees of freedom is drawn not from the statistical technical term but rather from traditional physics. Thus, the phrase is meant to call to mind the number of independent parameters that a mechanical system can have, such as the yaw, pitch, roll, etc. of a ship or airplane. Analogously, as discussed below, a German noun has three independent morphological parameters, gender, number, and case, each with multiple possible values.  <em>Ex hypothesi</em> , any combination of these parameters can carry important information about an author’s style, and therefore all “degrees of freedom” should be taken into consideration.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Because udpipe works sentence by sentence, all annotation must be completed before creating new smaller texts by subsampling since this random selection of course disrupts sentence structure. Thus, for strictly practical reasons, the sampling process is applied to the matrices of token plus annotation rather than to the raw text. This procedure seems to imply no theoretical implications beyond those entailed by the application of the bag-of-words method in general.

<p>Exploratory testing revealed that the L-2 option was the quickest and most accurate of those available. L-2 regression (also called Ridge Regression) is also preferable for the way it handles collinearity. L-2 regression distributes the weight that collinear variables will have in a model across those collinear variables. The alternative method, L-1 or Lasso Regression, by contrast, arbitrarily singles out one of the collinear variables and assigns it the full weight of those variables. L-2 appears more conducive for the interpretation of the importance of individual variables since L-1 may lead the unwary to dismiss the force of a large number of collinear inputs.&#160;<a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

Minimal computing is easy. Minimal computing consists of multiple methods, some as yet to be imagined. Minimal computing will end pandemics/thwart Putin/stop climate change. Minimal computing will save the humanities. Minimal computing is a false prophet. Minimal computing distracts from the pressing issues of the day. Minimal computing is static site generation. Minimal computing is hard. Minimal computing is not the answer.</p>
<p>Perhaps all of these statements made, explicitly or implicitly, throughout this special issue of  <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em>  are true. Perhaps they are all fiction. Or, perhaps, minimal computing is a methodological Jekyll and Hyde,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  good, evil, and, well, strange, all at once. Or, perhaps, minimal computing is a Rorschach inkblot — those of us who practice and critique it see what we want to see, project our hopes and fears, and expect too much. In this special issue, the first collection of peer reviewed scholarship on minimal computing, we shed light on the theories and practices of minimal computing through a blend of theoretical essays and case studies that illuminate how to undertake digital humanities scholarship under institutional and infrastructural constraints.</p>
<h2 id="defining-minimal-computing">Defining Minimal Computing</h2>
<p>Defining minimal computing is as quixotic a task as defining digital humanities itself <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  Minimal computing is less a singular methodology — or even a coherent set of methodologies — than it is a mode of thinking about digital humanities praxis that resists the idea that innovation is defined by newness, scale, or scope. Broadly speaking, minimal computing connotes digital humanities work undertaken in the context of some set of constraints. This could include lack of access to hardware or software, network capacity, technical education, or even a reliable power grid <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Minimal computing is an approach that, first and foremost, advocates for using  <em>only</em>  the technologies that are necessary and sufficient for developing digital humanities scholarship in such constrained environments. This does not mean that the minimal of minimal computing implies ease for all users or prescribes acceptable types of hardware, software, and platforms (e.g., Jekyll, Arduino, and Raspberry PI).<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  Rather, it gestures towards a decision-making process driven by the local contexts in which scholarship is being created. In this way, minimal computing is platform- and software-agnostic, emphasizing instead the importance of making these choices, based on the constraints with which we are working, to facilitate the development of digital humanities scholarship in environments where resources (e.g., financial, infrastructural, and labor) or freedoms (e.g., movement and speech) are scarce.</p>
<p>Our observations here may not satisfy those expecting a more concrete definition of minimal computing. Therefore, we offer the following: minimal computing is perhaps best understood as a heuristic comprising four questions to determine what is, in fact, necessary and sufficient when developing a digital humanities project under constraint: 1) what do we need?; 2) what do we have; 3) what must we prioritize?; and 4) what are we willing to give up?</p>
<p>What do we need? is a question that echoes throughout essays and case studies in this special issue. In 2016, Alex, along with Élika Ortega, posed this question in their essay,  “Multilingual Practices and Minimal Computing”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. The question of need is one intended to cut through a tendency in digital humanities to valorize keeping pace with trends towards high-speed computing, acquisition of the latest computational technologies, and fetishization of the cutting edge. Sometimes — perhaps often — when we pause to consider what we  <em>actually</em>  need to complete a project, the answer isn’t access to the latest and greatest but the tried and true. In our work with faculty and collaborators, we have seen firsthand how the drive to be innovative for the sake of innovation can be a deterrent to actually completing (or even starting) a project. For example, Roopika (Roopsi)<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  has had countless conversations with colleagues who are convinced that they  <em>need</em>  to use a particular piece of software, like ArcGIS, because it’s popular and has a name brand association with digital humanities, when something simpler like Tableau, ArcGIS StoryMaps, or even Google My Maps would suffice.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  Alex has had many similar conversations, in which the need to publish an online edition of a historical text is confused with the need to learn TEI, or the desire to count occurrences of a trope in a literary text is confused with learning Python or using an easy but expensive tool like NVivo. When we reorient our praxis around the question of  “what we need?”  rather than what we  <em>think</em>  we need, we are better positioned to see digital humanities projects through because our technical choices, methods, and research questions are more appropriately aligned.</p>
<p>The question of What do we have? is equally as critical because it encourages practitioners to focus on the assets available to them and thus resists a deficit mindset for those of us who are working under constraints. Quite often, the lauded models of digital humanities scholarship are projects developed with significant institutional resources and grant funding. It’s easy to look at those examples and focus on what we  <em>don’t</em>  have. Shifting the frame of our thinking towards what we  <em>do</em>  have is critical to identifying the resources we have at our disposal. Minimal computing draws the inspiration for this question from asset-based approaches that exist in multiple forms around the world, such as  <em>jugaad</em>  in India,  <em>gambiarra</em>  in Brazil,  <em>rebusque</em>  in Colombia,  <em>jua kali</em>  in Kenya, and  <em>zizhu chuangxin</em>  in China. These practices privilege making do with available materials for creative problem-solving and innovation <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. An example of this in the U.S. context appears in Joshua Davis’s book  <em>Spare Parts</em> , the story of a group of undocumented high school students whose underwater robotics team beat teams from colleges like MIT, who had access to high-tech polymers and funding from Xerox, simply by relying on knowledge gleaned from working with family members who were gardeners and mechanics <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. In her work at Salem State University, Roopsi and her colleagues Susan Edwards and Justin Snow put the question of what do we have? at the heart of their digital humanities initiatives with students. They focused on the resources they had — archival holdings on early 20th-century local history, their collective knowledge, their library server, and existing faculty professional development programs that they could reappropriate to build a digital humanities internship program for students <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Alex, in turn, has purposefully visited several countries around the world, and worlds within countries, to answer the question: what do folks doing humanities and cultural work have? The answers vary wildly, from the University of Khartoum&rsquo;s history department to Havana&rsquo;s undercommons to the incarcerated youth at Rikers Island in New York City. In Sudan, for example, electricity is unstable at certain times of day and Internet activity is censored by the government. This means that any solutions there must focus on what scholars do have: hard drives, where projects can live more freely than on the Internet; the ability to create multiple versions of projects to evade government censors; and dedicated, affordable PCs running on batteries to provide classes with access. Through a focus on what we do have, rather than what we don’t, we are better positioned to assess and leverage extant resources and use them to resourcefully make do with the means at our disposal. They may not look like the resources that are available at elite institutions or made possible by grant funding, but they are resources nonetheless.</p>
<p>Following on the questions of what we need and what we have, asking What must we prioritize? is essential to the mode of thinking for which minimal computing advocates. When working under constraints, we cannot treat all competing priorities in a project as equally important. When developing a recent project, Roopsi chose to use WordPress rather than the Jekyll static site generator for the website. While using Jekyll would have reduced maintenance and increased security because it does not rely on a database — two features that Roopsi prefers — WordPress’s graphical user interface (GUI) made website updates easier for all her collaborators.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  The learning curve for Jekyll, which involves using the command line and requires some rudimentary understanding of Markdown, CSS, and Liquid, was unfamiliar to most of them, and her collaborators, who work at universities with high teaching loads, could not allocate the bandwidth to learning Jekyll simply to add content to a website. Prioritizing people over platforms, in this instance, was the appropriate choice to ensure full participation of all collaborators. On the other hand, in his role as digital scholarship librarian, which included helping individual faculty members get digital projects off the ground, Alex found it enormously more time efficient to receive data from collaborators in formats that were already familiar to them (e.g., spreadsheets and Microsoft Word documents) and build projects for them using Jekyll or Wax himself. In both cases, the priority determines the choice of technology. Whether it is or isn&rsquo;t a technology associated with Minimal Computing™ is less important. The question What must we prioritize? speaks to the fact that minimal computing is not prescriptive or advocating for the use of particular software, hardware, or platforms, but rather points to a decision-making process that responds to the constraints of a given situation for project development.</p>
<p>The final question for minimal computing is, What are we willing to give up? In environments in which we are contending with limitations, whether of infrastructure, finances, labor, and/or technical knowledge, among other factors, we simply cannot have it all. There are tough decisions to be made, taking into account what we need, what we have, and what we must prioritize. This could mean eschewing the latest, flashiest methods that would cost more money, time, and labor, in favor of a simpler approach that would be practically achievable with what we have. Or it could mean choosing a platform that does not meet every desired requirement of a team but still makes it possible for a project to move forward.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  For example, when working with students at Salem State University, where students typically work 30-40 hours per week in addition to taking classes, Roopsi tended to use out-of-the-box tools that students can reasonably learn how to use during class time, rather than bespoke solutions that would require students to learn how to code and require substantial independent work outside of class. By giving up what might ultimately be prettier or more elegant, in the context of teaching, she instead focused on technologies that help students gain confidence in their digital literacy skills and have small wins that might later encourage them to develop a stronger technical skill set. Alex has made analogous decisions in his own practice. When designing the technology for the project Around DH in 80 Days, for example, he was confronted with the challenge of creating a map that could be downloaded in low bandwidth environments and even function on a USB key, in order to make the project capable of traveling around as many of the different digital infrastructures of the planet as possible. To do so, he had to give up on the idea of a map with functionalities such as zoom, tiles, or layers <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Recognizing that wanting to have it all is a deterrent is essential to making the choices necessary when working under constraints.</p>
<p>The minimal in minimal computing therefore stands in stark contrast to an implied maximal, where maximal connotes design choices that are made without putting the question of what is necessary and sufficient at the heart of decision-making. The primary contribution of minimal computing to digital humanities is to draw attention to the fact that the decisions we make when designing digital humanities projects — our use of particular kinds of hardware, software, and platforms — are not inherently virtuous (or lacking in virtue) but are inevitably encumbered by opportunities and challenges, affordances and limitations, and benefits and tradeoffs by nature. The authors in this issue grapple with these very concerns — just as the two of us do as practitioners — each coming to different answers that are responsive to the local contexts in which their theories and practices are being developed and the constraints of these environments. This is our minimal computing.</p>
<h2 id="tense-origins">Tense Origins</h2>
<p>Minimal computing in the humanities — like digital humanities itself — emerges from many parallel and intersecting origin stories. Rather than tracing the genealogies that led us to this special issue of  _Digital Humanities Quarterly _ chronologically, we might be better served by illuminating the tensions within digital humanities that have given rise to the concept over the past several decades and will continue to be shaped by minimal computing’s four constituent questions — 1) what do we need?; 2) what do we have; 3) what must we prioritize?; 4) what are we willing to give up? — in the foreseeable future.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
<p>The first tension implied in minimal computing is between the constant drive towards larger, faster, always-on forms of computing and the infrastructural, institutional, and financial realities that constrain digital humanities project development. In the context of academic research, this tension dates back to the birth of modern computers, long before the advent of the personal computer or the Internet. At that time, only elite universities in wealthy countries could afford mainframe computers for computational labor. Today, this impulse takes many forms in digital humanities, including the valorization of cluster computing, high speed Internet, cloud computing, and big data. Those supporting and relying on computation who work on the creation of online publications cite the need for user-friendly data entry (i.e., GUIs in web browsers) or continuous publication of new materials. Those working in cultural analytics, text analysis, and the like cite the need for large data processing capacity in the drive towards new insights derived algorithmically from large data sets of cultural corpora. Implied in this narrow definition of innovation is an access differential: those who have access to such technologies and those who do not.</p>
<p>The implications of this attitude have substantial impact on the future directions of digital humanities research. For example, grant funding and institutional support for digital humanities scholarship follows this mentality, exacerbating existing inequities. The creation of projects that rely solely on the Internet for distribution, thereby excluding large groups of scholars around the world from access, offers another example. While researchers in the Global North are beginning to develop more nuanced understandings of the asymmetrical ecologies of access to and use of technology — which researchers of the Global South have long understood — the expenses tied to newer, faster, and bigger technologies continue to have material implications on the ground.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  These costs go well beyond access, touching on environmental concerns, questions of ownership and control over scholarship in the context of postcolonial and neocolonial relationships, the reinforcement of inequitable prestige economies in the global academy, labor conditions for academic workers, and more. And, put simply, this attitude implicitly limits the scope of digital humanities scholarship to the type of work that can be produced with more robust resources.</p>
<p>The second tension is a relatively newer one between metaphorical computer literacy — the ability to use GUIs, an act in which most people with computational devices engage through their ordinary interactions online — and symbolic computational literacy, or the ability to code, which remains the purview of a rare few, especially in the humanities. Much has been made of the debate over whether one must code to be a digital humanist<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. The two of us have, at earlier moments in our careers, understood firsthand how many who wish to undertake digital humanities scholarship are simply looking for easy access to out-of-the-box software and platforms with GUIs for project development.</p>
<p>The history of digital humanities is marked by many laudable efforts to create tools with GUIs that allow scholars to create digital scholarship in the humanities without having to develop much symbolic computational literacy. However, these tools are inextricably linked to the dominance of English as a lingua franca for programming and markup languages, with downstream implications for those working with languages other than English — namely the emphasis on Anglophone scholarship in digital humanities and the comparative underdevelopment of multilingual digital humanities, particularly languages in scripts other than Latin and those read from right to left <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. In addition, we have increasingly come to understand that GUIs hide the systems that drive that production, and by extension, the labor to maintain and sustain them. For example, platforms like WordPress that rely on a database require labor to keep abreast of updates and patches, deprecated dependencies like plugins, and their vulnerability to security breaches — and to fix the issues that inevitably arise. Such invisible labor is so successfully obscured that even the most veteran practitioners struggle with its implications after decades of work in the field <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Technologies associated with Minimal Computing™ like Jekyll offer some relief from labor issues by avoiding reliance on a database, though not without inevitable tradeoffs — among them, the learning curve for use.</p>
<p>The minimal of minimal computing has been assumed by some to promise ease of use or to only require a minimal amount of symbolic computational literacy. Certainly, a team might choose to use a GUI because it best serves the questions of what we need, have, must prioritize, and are willing to give up. However, like all design decisions, such a choice comes with consequences. While those who doubt their ability to learn how to code see the use of GUI-driven platforms as the key to access, often these systems foreclose more control over the production of knowledge, and by extension, participation that is more meaningful to those who seek access. As Matthew Kirschenbaum has proposed, coding is a form of worldmaking, in which the coder defines how that world operates <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. In the context of digital humanities, being able to code gives us the power to create new worlds in which we model human knowledge and culture <sup id="fnref2:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. As we (Roopsi and Alex) have developed our own capacity to code, we have come to see the ways that it has opened up the possibilities for digital humanities scholarship, particularly when working with material from communities that have historically been — and continue to be — excluded from the cultural record.</p>
<p>Making the transition to thinking and practicing in the realm of symbolic computational literacy, we can more easily seek solutions that promote broader access through reduction of technological complexity (e.g., minimizing reliance on databases, thereby reducing security risk and maximizing access in low bandwidth environments). The idea of a reduction in computation has two useful and concrete senses for us: first, literally less code or fewer bytes, and in turn, less computational processing time or capacity. This notion of doing more with less has been fundamental to the development and teaching of computer science, where students are introduced early on to the concept of Big O notation, which highlights the importance of ever more efficient algorithms to accomplish a given task. We also see this drive towards elegance in the history of UNIX systems, and in some of the foundational forms of computing that are still in use today in digital humanities. A reduction in computation implies a reduction in energy consumed, storage, and labor. In the same vein, we know that computation itself allows us to perform many tasks that could be done by hand but would take substantially longer. Take for example the creation of a works cited page: we can either construct it by ourselves, or we could let software like Zotero write it for us based on our bibliographic data. While by no means wedded to reduction in computation or the substitution of manual labor by computation as requirements, minimal computing asks us to imagine how these might help us accomplish our various scholarly tasks in the humanities.</p>
<p>Implied in the first two tensions is a crucial third: the tension between choice and necessity. In her work at Salem State University, Roopsi worked with minimal hardware, created small static sites, and processed small data sets out of necessity, born from working at a resource-starved public university. Alex, in his work at Columbia University, did so often by choice. In her new position at Dartmouth College, Roopsi will have the choice to work with expensive software or cluster computing — a choice that Alex had at Columbia and will have at Yale University. Both of us can take for granted high speed Internet access provided by our universities, as well as access to a reliable power grid. Even accounting for the major disparities in resources between the institutions where we started our careers, we recognize that our work in digital humanities has been undertaken in relative privilege not shared by our colleagues around the world.</p>
<p>Choosing to do otherwise — to pursue maximal approaches to digital humanities — is not inherently noxious. However, the humanities, charged with the interpretation and stewardship of human culture writ large, cannot afford to ignore scholarship developed under substantial constraints or circumstances. Otherwise, we will only reproduce and amplify the exclusions and biases that colonialism and neocolonialism have produced in the analog cultural and historical record <sup id="fnref3:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Accordingly, any desire to work alongside colleagues around the world to ensure the production of a more inclusive digital cultural record requires engagement with necessity and constraint. Minimal computing provides theoretical and practical considerations to facilitate such collaboration and dialogue.</p>
<p>The tensions we have outlined arise out of unfortunate political, historical, and economic circumstances that provide urgent and appropriate ground for minimal computing practices and theory to thrive. This larger set of circumstances is beyond humanities practitioners to resolve, but they certainly provide the frame and fuel for much of our practice today. We would be remiss, however, to not acknowledge the relationship between the climate crisis and the development of computational technologies. Computing emerged in medias res of a process that began with the imperial enterprises of Portugal and Spain five centuries ago, only to be turbo-charged during the Industrial Revolution and to begin steadily accelerating during the second half of the 20th century. Despite its relatively late arrival, the demands of computing on energy sources seem to grow exponentially as the world becomes more dependent on computers. Ecological activism consistently casts a critical look at these rising costs. In addition to energy, the environmental impact of computation includes mineral exploitation, chemical emissions during production, and e-waste and landfill runoff. Clean energy for the planet may be solved in this or the next century, but we can&rsquo;t know that with certainty without recourse to some mystic belief in innovation, structural change, and destiny. We are left with few concrete options to join the effort to reverse our impact on the planet besides our voices, one of them being the reduction of our relatively small carbon footprint as scholars.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="why-minimal-computing">Why Minimal Computing?</h2>
<p>To be clear, our investment in minimal computing comes not from a fetish for computational reduction or a bias against databases or supercomputing but from a very real fear that reliance on these technologies is foreclosing the possibilities for the development of a digital cultural record that includes the voices and stories from communities that have been elided in the cultural record — like our own.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  This fear and our belief in the possibility of changing it is what fundamentally drives all the work we do <sup id="fnref4:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. As we have noted, documentary culture — the primary sources, archives, and texts that attest to human knowledge and history — has been profoundly shaped by colonialism. Its transformations, brought about by computers and networks, place us today in a long transition from an analog cultural and historical record to a hybrid one — parts analog, parts digital. This is not to suggest that the digital is distinct from material reality — the digital is itself material — but the analog record and the digital record are different enough that it&rsquo;s helpful to think about the digital as a separate domain. (In short, preserving paper is a fundamentally different affair than preserving bitstreams.)</p>
<p>The construction of this new record of the human past, present, and future, as we have also suggested, is gravely affected by socio-technical inequities — not every cultural heritage or scholarly outfit around the world has access to the same infrastructure or resources. In response to this, minimal computing encourages solutions that can be implemented universally. The irony of two people trained as postcolonialists advocating for a universal is not lost on us. This is the same paradox that many anti-colonial and postcolonial writers explored in the 20th century: to seek the universal in the recovery of the particulars that were ignored in colonial archives and rendered invisible by the totalizing impulse of European colonialism and its Enlightenment  <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. However, what we seek is an interoperability of digital humanities practices that promote access and equity in digital knowledge production.</p>
<p>A quick overview, in the largest of broad strokes, paints a concerning picture of the scholarly record at a planetary scale today. The European, North American, and East Asian dominance in the production of knowledge is evident in terms of brute quantity. Concomitant with this state of affairs, several pirate operations have arisen from the ashes of the former Soviet Union and its satellites, creating libraries that give access to a large part of this knowledge to the rest of the world with access to the Internet.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>  In Latin America, the long history of open access initiatives gives us further hope. Despite these liberatory efforts, the flows of knowledge continue to move from those who produce the most in the putative West to the rest — mimicking flows of colonial power from center to periphery — without any clear sign that the movement is reciprocated through uptake of scholarship from the Global South.</p>
<p>At the heart of this state of affairs is the role of capital in the control of scholarly production. Open access and pirate enterprises point away from the accumulation of capital, and as such, clash with the monopolizing tendencies of the North Atlantic and East Asian models of knowledge production, which coincide with larger expenses in computational infrastructure. It is, perhaps, no surprise that such tendencies have led to the knowledge cartels of the Global North attempting to co-opt open access through article processing charges (APCs) levied on authors to make their scholarship open access. Minimal computing intervenes by studying and creating modes of production that promise control at the local level for those who wish to avoid absorption by capital, who don&rsquo;t want to cede their intellectual integrity to the pressures that come with that absorption, and whose work is suppressed because it does not align with that which capital values (i.e., knowledge production beyond the Global North).<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>  This includes an exploration of the possibilities for community knowledge production that define the shifting epistemologies of our historical moment.</p>
<p>When we speak of knowledge production, we no longer speak simply of the production of documents. We include the production of data, data sets, and documents as data, all of which can be used for algorithmic analysis or manipulation. The issue of control over data sets, especially those that can inform the pasts of whole demographics of people in the world, will certainly come to a head in the 21st century. One example of danger is control over Black data. At the moment of writing, the vast majority of the data and documents that help us understand the history of Black people during the period of Atlantic chattel slavery are controlled by predominantly white scholarly teams and library administrators or white-owned vendors.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  This demonstrates how access to infrastructure has direct consequences on our study and reconstruction of the past and, by extension, what we understand that past to be. While data reparations must be made, our interest here is in the role that minimal computing can play in the development of present and future data sets, documents as data, and methods that promote collaboration and interoperability among colleagues around the world by not only taking into account uneven distribution of resources and the constraints with which the majority are contending but also by ensuring that control over the production of knowledge is in their hands.</p>
<p>All of this scholarly and cultural work by necessity implies the need for different labor arrangements. Large or wealthy universities and colleges in the North Atlantic, for example, enjoy full-time information technology and digital scholarship teams working in and outside libraries that provide a certain degree of stability to the creation of digital collections and digital humanities scholarly projects. A few companies, staff on soft-money, and independent contractors have also joined the fray to provide their technical services. Granting agencies in rich economies have supported the production of digital humanities projects that involve arrangements between non-technical scholars and teams of technologists, often with an unacknowledged systems administration team provided by institutions or a company. In this arrangement the scholars with resources bear little pressure to understand the fundamentals of the labor arrangements that make their projects possible and are alienated from the means of production of their own knowledge. In addition to our concern for those who provide invisible labor, we recognize that those who do not have access to such arrangements will only continue to lag in their ability to keep pace with those who do. By advocating for minimal computing, therefore, we aim to create a more level playing field for the future of a digital cultural record where the voices of those who have been excluded can be heard and valued through a more equitable, collaborative approach to the labor of knowledge production that facilitates their engagement.</p>
<h2 id="minimal-computing-and-its-discontents">Minimal Computing and Its Discontents</h2>
<p>In their own ways, articles in this special issue speak to the ways the tensions of environment, race, access, labor, and control interface with the material realities of producing digital humanities scholarship under constraints. This issue features two types of contributions: theoretical essays and case studies. The five lengthier essays build on the early writings of the Minimal Computing Working Group, as well as our own writing <sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref5:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, to expand, imagine, dream, caution, critique, and, at times, heckle. The nine case studies that follow take a closer look at how minimal computing is practiced, on the ground, through projects and tools being developed and used.</p>
<p>The essays explore the theories and practices of minimal computing. We open the issue with Grant Wythoff’s  “Ensuring Minimal Computing Serves Maximal Connection,”  which examines current conversations on digital minimalism in light of the history of minimalism in art and asks whether arguments for minimalism hold in a socially-distant and unevenly connected world. We continue with two essays that take different approaches to exploring the relationship between minimal computing and labor. Tiffany Chan and Jentery Sayers’s  “Minimal Computing from the Labor Perspective”  considers the lessons from the University of Victoria Libraries’ migration Vault to advocate for degrowth of digital projects by articulating project needs, the labor required, and how to sustain it. Exploring the affective dimensions of minimal computing, Quinn Dombrowski’s essay,  “Minimizing Computing Maximizes Labor,”  argues that the tradeoff for using static site generation for web development is a concomitant increase in emotional labor and proposes needed interventions to realize the potential of static-site generators for digital humanities scholarship. Offering a critique of plain-text, Nabeel Siddiqui’s  “Hidden in Plain-TeX: Investigating Minimal Computing Workflows”  situates Markdown, a markup language used in Minimal Computing™, in the history of TeX and explores the lessons it provides for those who engage with digital humanities. Concluding this section, Martin Eve’s  “Lessons from the Library: Extreme Minimalist Scaling at Pirate Ebook Platforms”  proposes a novel application of minimal computing to the emergence of pirate libraries that explores tensions between minimalism and maximalism in Library Genesis and its scalability.</p>
<p>Equally as important are the case studies, which present minimal computing in practice. They collectively offer an exploration of multiple methods, articulating how they exemplify, build on, and expand minimal computing practices in diverse geographic, cultural, and linguistic contexts. We begin with case studies that offer insight on labor and precarity. Matthew Lincoln, Jennifer Isasi, Sarah Melton, and François Dominic Laramée’s  “Relocating Complexity: The Programming Historian and Multilingual Static Site Generation”  discusses the labor-based challenges of maintaining a sustainable static-site architecture for the  <em>Programming Historian</em>  when expanding into multilingual publication. Christina Boyles and Andy Boyles Petersen’s case study,  “Power and Precarity: Lessons from the Makers by Mail Project,”  interrogates the relationship between minimal computing and academic austerity, using the question, What do we need? to center not only technological developments but also ethical engagement.</p>
<p>We continue with case studies that examine cross-border collaborations. Sylvia Fernández’s  “ <em>United Fronteras</em>  como tercer espacio: Modelo transfronterizo a través de las humanidades digitales poscoloniales y la computación mínima”  ( “ <em>United Fronteras</em>  as Third Space: A Transborder Model Through Postcolonial Digital Humanities and Minimal Computing” ) discusses how the project  <em>United Fronteras</em>  counters hegemonic representations of the Mexico-United States border and argues that minimal computing practices generate a third digital space to document multiple histories and public memory of the borderlands. Shifting transnational collaboration into the realm of teaching, Raffaele Viglianti, Gimena del Rio Riande, and Nidia Hernández’s case study,  “Open, Equitable, and Minimal: Teaching Digital Scholarly Editing North and South,”  examines how minimal computing can establish common ground between research environments in the Global North and Global South through their experience teaching a Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) course on minimal digital scholarly editions at Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires, Argentina and the University of Maryland, College Park in the United States.</p>
<p>Taking up minimal editions from another angle, Zahra Rizvi, Rohan Chauhan, A. Sean Pue, and Nishat Zaidi’s case study,  “Minimal Computing for Exploring Indian Poetics,”  explores their use of plain text and minimal computing to produce multilingual, annotated digital critical editions of poetry in multiple Indian languages and to visualize poetics. Looking at the challenges of language, labor, and socio-technical infrastructure, Till Grallert’s  “Open Arabic Periodical Editions: A Framework for Bootstrapped Scholarly Editions Outside the Global North”  provides an in-depth look at successful efforts to digitize and disseminate texts from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>We conclude the issue with case studies that explore applications of minimal computing beyond textual studies. Chris Diaz’s case study,  “Minimal Computing with Progressive Web Apps,”  describes his work in collaboration with museums and students to develop  <em>Caravans of Gold</em> , a multilingual digital exhibit built as both a static website and progressive web app. Tackling the challenge of documenting intangible cultural heritage, Jing Chen, Mengqi Li, Wensi Lin, Yinzhou Zhao, Mengyue Chang, Han Chen, Quiang Hu, and Yongqing Xie’s  “Simple but Beautiful: A Case Study on the ZHI Project of Traditional Craftsmanship”  discusses how to use minimal computing to bridge a gap between craftspeople and the general public and facilitate sustainable knowledge production about cornerstones of traditional craftsmanship in Nanjing, China: Yunjin brocade, gold foil forging, and velvet flower making. Finally, Tanya Clement, Ben Brumfield, and Sara Brumfield’s  “The AudiAnnotate Project: Four Case Studies in Publishing Annotations for Audio and Video”  discusses their work creating the AudiAnnotate platform, which builds on the IIIF standards for AV to address challenges of engaging with audio through annotation.</p>
<p>As the essays and case studies indicate, we welcomed engagement from minimal computing enthusiasts and critics alike in this special issue. Indeed, our articulation of minimal computing in this introduction is as influenced by the insights and critiques raised by authors in this issue as it was by our previous writing and work with the Minimal Computing Working Group. The most salient critique for us, which demands the most attention, is the technical education (i.e., symbolic computational literacy, or knowing how to code) that reduction in computation requires. Time to learn new skills is a privilege, and technological training is not something that can be delivered in a few workshops or a summer school. Rather, it requires sustained effort with the belief that the time invested will ultimately liberate scholarship from reliance on out-of-the-box tools and open up new possibilities for representation of material from minortized communities in the digital cultural record. Further, as several of the essays and case studies in this issue testify, a complete divorce from expensive or maximal forms of computation prove impossible at present. The relationship with social media, Google and Amazon infrastructure, large databases, and GitHub will continue for the foreseeable future. Despite critiques, which can and should continue to be addressed through our collective work, the two of us still see minimal computing as a space wherein we can explore forms of computation that do not depend on expensive infrastructures and the harmful practices of the centers of capital accumulation in the 21st century. In the final tally, we hope this conversation can serve as one of the loci of inspiration for original local and regional practices that best meet the needs of the workers of the record and a critique of current systems of knowledge distribution and (re-)production of the past — both humanistic and technical.</p>

<p>For those who insist on a Marvel Comics-style origin story: By the shores of Lake Geneva, Alps looming in the distance, the Minimal Computing Working Group was born at its first workshop at the Digital Humanities 2014 Conference in Lausanne. As the workshop’s <a href="http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/minimal-computing/kickstart-workshop/">call for proposals</a> suggests, the themes running through this special issue are deeply connected to initial framings for minimal computing and the principles of minimal computing have given rise to a variety of methods. In the intervening years, minimal computing saw multiple developments, such as the <a href="https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">Minimal Computing Working Group site</a>; development of software and workflows, such as <a href="https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/">Ed., a Jekyll theme for minimal digital editions</a>, and <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/wax/">Wax, a workflow for producing minimal digital exhibits</a>; and the vanquishing of Thanos.
