<p>…come celebrate</p>
<p>with me that everyday</p>
<p>something has tried to kill me</p>
<p>and has failed.</p>
<p>-Lucille Clifton, “won’t you celebrate with me”</p>
<p>Black women graduate students who go online in search of community and infrastructure that they may lack on campus often become unlikely digital humanists. My own ability to identify myself as a digital humanist was a direct result of crafting, curating and cultivating years’ worth of content about graduate school for current and prospective Black woman graduate students on my blog, <em>Black Girl Does Grad School</em> ( <em>BGDGS</em> ) <em>,</em> and on Twitter. I have chronicled my journey into the academy since August 2016 on <em>BGDGS</em> , but this work has only recently become a part of my scholarly intervention. It practices a form of Black digital feminism, which communications scholar Catherine Knight Steele argues centralizes agency and our ability to prioritize ourselves in digital spaces<a class="footnote-ref" href="#steele2021"> [steele2021] </a>. Our digital media making is as Moya Bailey argues, “a form of self-preservation and harm reduction that disrupts the onslaught of the problematic images that society perpetuates” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2021"> [bailey2021] </a>. We invest in each other, and use social media not just for activism, but for <em>celebrating</em> .</p>
<p>Regardless of discipline, Black woman graduate students exist in abundance online and use Twitter, Instagram, blogs, vlogs and podcasts tospill the teaon all aspects of graduate life. An entire network of Black graduate digital content creators exists, who produce resources on everything from wellness and finance, to practical skills like abstract and grant writing, to spaces for personal narratives. We take to the digital as a space to resist the marginalizing ways of the Academy as it exists. We fight, but we also care for each other, promote transparency about the graduate school process, lift as we climb, build professional networks and friendships alike. We utilize the digital in innovative ways to transform our individual and often isolated experiences into collectives. Blogs, podcasts, Instagram accounts, twitter threads, digital writing groups, and more all serve as methods of resisting and engaging in carework. This essay will explore the various ways Black women graduate students have decided that <em>our</em>  “revolution will not be televised” — but it will be online <a class="footnote-ref" href="#everett2002"> [everett2002] </a>.</p>
<p>Historian and digital humanist Jessica Marie Johnson writes in a 2014 blog post, “my feminism is a fury and fierce joy. It is an ACTION” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2014"> [johnson2014] </a>. Her exploration of her personal brand of feminism, which is derived from the thinkers of the Kitchen Table press, The Combahee Collective, her mother and ancestors, is thespirit of abolition,futuristic,anddigital.Johnson, who would go on to write more about the intersections of Black feminism and digital humanities in articles such as, “Alter Egos and Infinite Literacies, Part III: How to Build a Real Gyrl in Three Easy Steps,” and “4DH + 1 black code / Black femme forms of knowledge and practice,” &quot; becoming a leading force in Black digital humanities, offers important ways to think about Black women&rsquo;s digital futures. “Alter Egos and Infinite Literacies, Part III,” details the beautiful ways Black women self-make online. The digital, she argues, is a way to write oneself [the Black woman/girl&rsquo;s self] visible<a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2015"> [johnson2015] </a>. It is a tool for witnessing and mourning<a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2018"> [johnson2018] </a>. And the digital allows the space for our feminism to reflect life: messy<a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2014"> [johnson2014] </a>.</p>
<p>Because this article takes seriously the bonds formed by Black graduate students and the collective work we do in digital spaces, the primary sources that provide evidence for my claims (which take the form of articles, tweets, blog posts, and more ephemeral digital media, such as Instagram Live videos) reflect my experience building networks on Twitter, via blogs, and connecting with other content creators for other engagements: webinars, podcast episodes, and digital writing groups, to name a few. In the years since beginning my journey to the doctorate, Black women graduate students online have been integral to my success: they have sent me care packages during difficult moments in the program, they have forwarded my name for opportunities because they saw my tweets on the topic, we have held weekly pandemic watch parties using Twitter hashtags like #KorraKickback and #CrystalGemCrew, and we have organized together to support each other’s individual ventures, appearing on each other’s blogs and podcasts and online summits.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Simply put, the sources critical to this project were selected because of their personal impact on me — my personal orientation towards what qualifies as academic work, as well as, my well-being as a person. Though one may dismiss the value of personal connections as the premise for a scholarly study, I will note that collectives, particularly those who center marginalized people, take seriously (Black) feminist ethics seriously. Think of the Combahee Collective,<a href="https://femtechnet.org/">FemTechNet</a>, and more recently the digital project and online community curated by digital humanities scholar and historian, Jessica Marie Johnson, and scholar of Afro-Latinx literature, Yomaira C. Figueroa,<a href="https://www.electricmarronage.com/">Electric Marronage</a>. These collectives are intentional about developing digital havens of care while promoting rigorous intellectual inquiry and centering joy, tasks which I find present in the online networks Black women graduate students have created.</p>
<p>This essay also takes cues from digital autoethnographic methodologies used by theorist Moya Bailey to self-reflexively examine my own place in this network of Black graduate students and how we occupy and use online spaces<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2015"> [bailey2015] </a>. The essay draws from the multi-modal nature of Black Studies and uses narrative to underscore salient pieces of theory, as personal narrative is important to both Critical Race Theory as well as Black Feminist Theory.Anecdotes,as many like to call storytelling and narrative, are at the heart of Black digital humanities. If, as Brock writes, “all technologies are culturally and socially shaped,” then it follows that the stories which create our cultures and social realities are integral to how we use technology and how our use of these technologies reshape them<a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2019"> [brock2019] </a>. Therefore, the stories and shared experiences that unite Black women graduate students inform how we have used technology to resist, work, and celebrate together.</p>
<h2 id="the-unintentional-and-additional-labor-of-hypervisible-online-discourse">The Unintentional and Additional Labor of Hypervisible Online Discourse</h2>
<p>This section examines the carework Black graduate students practice towards each other online, but also the necessity of labor implied therein. We congregate in a corner of this digital satellite counterpublic, as André Brock would call Black Twitter, for communal support, but we also exhibit characteristics of resistance, as well as joy<a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2019"> [brock2019] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#steele2011"> [steele2011] </a>. We gain a collective energy from navigating questions of professionality and respectability in the physical Academy, but online as well, particularly in the way we choose to signify, knowing our conversations are hypervisible and subject to surveillance<a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2019"> [brock2019] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#browne2015"> [browne2015] </a>. This makes our online presences susceptible to additional labor — whether intentional as we extend carework to our peers, or unintentional as colleagues use our online presences as instructional.</p>
<p>Susan Brown’s contribution to Elizabeth Losh and Jacquelyn Wernimont’s edited volume <em>Bodies of Information: Intersectional Feminism and the Digital Humanities</em> [<a href="#losh2019">2019</a>], offers an important insight to the way work is often parceled in the Academy. Brown here points to the fact that women and femme scholars are often saddled with additional service labor unlike their male counterparts. This includes, for example, serving on diversity committees, panels on status of gender (or race) in the Academy/one’s given field, or doing work for university projects that may not count towards one’s tenure file. However, Brown’s argument does not quite address the intersections of race with this statement. Scholars of color often shoulder the extra emotional labor of service positions related to their racial or ethnic identities, as well as providing mentorship for undergraduate students that come to them in search of a professor that can understand them. These additional services begin as we take on professional roles as part of our graduate training.</p>
<p>Black women often find themselves in positions representing both women and scholars of color as well as facing misogynoir — prejudice toward Black women specifically — in and outside of the classroom<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2021"> [bailey2021] </a>. Legal scholar and critical race theorist Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw aptly describes, spaces meant for Black people are often posited towards Black men, and spaces meant for women tend to be for white women [<a href="#crenshaw1991">1991</a>]. Black women find ourselves often as the sole representative of either or both Black people or women, leading others to believe that we represent all of either or both Black people or women, ignoring the heterogeneity of both groups. As Patricia Hill Collins [<a href="#collins1991">1991</a>] informs us, “Despite the common challenges confronting African-American women as a group, individual Black women neither have identical experiences nor interpret experiences in a similar fashion. The existence of core themes does not mean that African-American women respond to these themes in the same way” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#collins1991"> [collins1991] </a>. While many Black women graduate students are unified by common themes of gendered racial violence, difficulty navigating controlling images of Black women based stereotypes, such as perceptions about our anger, and the resulting frustration and fatigue of consistently managing this visibility and invisibility, our experiences are unique and individual<a class="footnote-ref" href="#collins1991"> [collins1991] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cooper2018"> [cooper2018] </a>.</p>
<p>These common themes, however, impact the way early career Black women scholars work and it is imperative that we understand the dual nature of how many of us approach it. For some, Black studies methodologies and Black life is critical to the core of our intellectual inquiry — those who study Black history, literature or cultural anthropology, humanities scholars, for example. For students of the hard sciences, as engineering Ph.D. student and creator, Allanté Whitmore, has noted, it may be more difficult to combine issues of race with their objects of study. In a recent #ShareTheMic event in collaboration with the graduate wellness and lifestyle blog, @PhDBalance, Whitmore spoke to the feeling of being torn: being <em>either</em> an engineer <em>or</em> someone whose life is impacted by issues of race. The academy encourages, <em>forces,</em> us to compartmentalize when Black feminist theory tells us that multiple truths may exist at once. We are not able to separate out our identities, in the same way that Black women are both Black and woman at the same time without needing to choose “which comes first.”</p>
<p>Black graduate students produce astounding amounts of additional labor, in addition to those detailed earlier, particularly those with visible social media presences. The work does not end when one leaves the classroom or the lab; it continues on as Black graduate students use Twitter, blogs, vlogs and podcasts to do the work of providing incoming graduate students with infrastructure and ourselves with support and care. The labor continues beyond even this, as many of us take on the work of restorative justice, abolition, fights for living wages and unionization efforts. The question that plagues many a department and university remains how to recruit a more diverse campus climate; however, if Black graduate students are self-organizing and creating infrastructures for ourselves in academic spaces because there is an extreme lack of resources available on the part of the institution, then perhaps recruitment is not the underlying issue. Black graduate students take to the digital to coach each other through working under the conditions of systemic institutional violence. <em>That</em> is why, in part, these digital networks exist.</p>
<h2 id="resistance-as-labor">Resistance as Labor</h2>
<p>Often, the spaces Black folks occupy online are seen and viewed as resistance. A fair assumption to make given that much of online activism finds its origins with Black folks — Black women, femmes and queer folks, in particular<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2021"> [bailey2021] </a>. Consider, for example, #BlackLivesMatter, which was originally coined by Patrice Cullors, Opal Tometti and Alicia Garza, has become the rallying cry of the new millennium; #MeToo originated with Tarana Burke, sparked the movement for accountability and recourse for those accused of sexual assault; and #BlackGirlMagic, which began as Black Girls Are Magic, founded by CaShawn Thompson, asks us to continually consider the ethereal essence of being a Black girl. Works by Feminista Jones, Kim Gallon as well as Moya Bailey, Sarah J. Jackson and Brooke Foucault Welles, foregrounds the digital activist labor done by Black women<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jones2019"> [jones2019] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2021"> [bailey2021] </a>. Resistance is labor.</p>
<p>When Black graduate students take to Twitter, for example, to form community bonds and to push back against the oppressive confines of the Academy, our resistance is labor<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gutierrez2012"> [gutierrez2012] </a>. Black women faculty are underrepresented in higher education, and thus experience “hyper-visibility and attention, pressure to over-perform, and social isolation” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gutierrez2012"> [gutierrez2012] </a>. Shanna Benjamin, Roxane Donovan, and Joycelyn Moody (<a href="#benjamin2016">2016</a>) also write that, “In addition to tokenism effects, other institutional and structural barriers work independently and collectively to hinder Black women faculty’s academic success, including excessive service/caretaking expectations, student opposition and hostility, devaluing/undervaluing of research, and experiences of gendered racism and racialized sexism” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gutierrez2012"> [gutierrez2012] </a>. It is out of the scope of Benjamin, Donovan and Moody’s work, but many of the concerns they present as obstacles for Black women faculty begin early in the graduate student career as Black women graduate students navigate classroom environments as teaching assistants and power dynamics in working with their advisors. </p>
<p>Black women, for example, are often expected to take on extraordinary amounts of extra uncompensated service labor, which can include anything from mentoring BIPOC students; to directing centers or programs; and to being asked to split our time between various Diversity, Equity and Inclusion committees and panels to represent one of the handful of Black women at our institution. And while it must be said that many of us do love and cherish the work we do to support our students and fight for better campus environments for all, much of that work goes unnoticed, unappreciated, and does not count towards tenure and securing a job. This is in addition to the assumptions of incompetence and/or superheroism in respect to Black women in these spaces<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wallace1979"> [wallace1979] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#harrisperry2011"> [harrisperry2011] </a>. As Bailey, Jackson, and Welles write, “Black women have found Twitter to be a productive tool for highlighting misogynoir, sharing survival strategies and calling both intra- and intercommunity members to account” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2021"> [bailey2021] </a>. We use the digital, therefore, to “speak truth to power” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2021"> [bailey2021] </a>.</p>
<p>The threads from the June 2020 hashtag movement, #BlackInTheIvory, co-created by Joy Melody Woods and Dr. Shardé M. Davis shows in stark relief exactly what Black woman graduate students, but also Black professors and other academics in particular, face in the Academy. Woods and Davis’ hashtag encouraged Black academics to put a name to acts of racism they have endured in academic spaces, inspired and fueled by the collective rage that is moving us toward calls for system change. In an interview with NBC, Woods says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we&rsquo;re calling for the firing of police officers who put their knees on the necks of black people physically, then we should be calling for firings and suspensions of faculty who metaphorically put their knees on the necks of black graduate students. Some of the actions they have done, and you&rsquo;ll see this on the thread, they have landed people in psychiatric facilities &hellip; You say you want solidarity, well, we have the collective knowledge and evidence now and white folks can no longer look away.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#aviles2020"> [aviles2020] </a><br>
Many of the stories, including my own, appear to be individual or isolated incidents; when considered together, they illustrate the insidious nature of the racist infrastructure on which the Academy is built, deliberately crafted to keep Black folks out. #BlackInTheIvory told stories of tenure denials (see also “#TenureForPaul” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#harris2020"> [harris2020] </a>), failed examinations, and racist remarks both overheard in departments and said to Black scholars.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> While the aftermath of outpouring of stories was fraught, there was a moment in which Black scholars chose to speak up as a particular method for resistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>#BlackInTheIvory points to many of these challenges, as Woods and Davis note in an interview with <em>The New York Times,</em> but journalists Harmon, Mandavilli, Maheshwari and Kantor write, “The stories of exclusion, humiliation and hostility were all too familiar. But the difference was that they had mostly been shared behind closed doors” [<a href="#harmon2020">2020</a>]. Not entirely true — many of these stories have been shared on social media. Perhaps whispered and without naming individuals, but they stories have gotten around the internet. Though some hashtag user did point to this truth: the precarity of many of our situations, including graduate students who will soon go on the academic job market, simply cannot afford to speak out for fear of recourse, which could be anything from denial of a job, which impacts financial security, to continued harassment, on and offline. As @ADBoyntonII tweets: “Being #BlackInTheIvory is knowing that these tweets are only a tip of the iceberg. Many of us are too vulnerable to risk telling the whole truth.” The tweet in its entirety is reproduced below, published with the express permission of the original author.</p>
<p>The work Joy Melody Woods is doing with #BlackInTheIvory is but one way Black graduate students are using the digital as platforms for activism, advocacy, resistance and support. And while #BlackInTheIvory is indeed resistance work, it is also a form of catharsis for those who can and do engage. This is perhaps not entirely what Brock speaks of when he describes libidinal economy, however, the impulse underlies the energy needed to execute a movement like #BlackInTheIvory. At its core, this resistance work remains labor.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-joy-and-refusing-to-shrink">Choosing Joy and Refusing to Shrink</h2>
<p>How then do we think about the relationship Black people have to joy, technology, labor and resistance? The fact remains that we should not let our circumstances steal our joy. As I wrote in 2017, early in my graduate school journey: “I deserve a quality life” :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As often as you can, I think it’s worthwhile to list out things you can do to pick yourself up when you’re sad, things that you love doing because it feeds your soul, and just things you need to do to feel like a functional human. When it feels like nothing will make you feel better, just looking at list of things that make you smile reminds you that, at some point, all of this made you happy. During finals season, I’m going to make sure I come back to this list, so I can do things that center me and bring me a little peace. I deserve to have a quality life, and I am the only one who can ensure that for myself.<br>
[<a href="https://blackgirldoesgradschool.com/2017/11/19/week-12-or-the-mental-health-project-part-2/">blackgirldoesgradschool.com</a>, 2017]<br>
Even early in my graduate school journey, as early as 2017, my goal was to maintain my own joy because I realized that I owed the Academy nothing and I am my own person. <em>That</em> I believe is part of the resistance. In an essay from <em>The Source of Self-Regard,</em> Toni Morrison writes of some of thesilencing challengesof Afro-American art/literature, one which forces us our art to only be valuable if compared to Eurocentric art<a class="footnote-ref" href="#morrison2019"> [morrison2019] </a>. In a similar manner, the Academy seeks often only knowledge by Black scholars if it is presented in a way that mimics Western, imperialistic ideals. Choosing joy for Black scholars is the act of choosing to be whole in spite of what the Academy would rather us be: finding delight in self-expression when our voices are often interpreted as combative or aggressive, reveling in the reaction of the intended audiences of our work rather than the critiques of those who would intentionally misunderstand it, wearing our hair however we please in spite of the pressure of respectability<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cooper2017"> [cooper2017] </a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if the arguments and claims I have staked so far are true:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Resistance is labor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joy is resistance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then…</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Joy must also be labor.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is, unfortunately, work, for Black people to remain joyous and retain joy for ourselves, particularly in moments of acute strife, such as the moment in which I write these very words — the summer of 2020. 2020 will be forever known globally for the Coronavirus; Black people will remember it as the summer in which we were driven to protest in the midst of a pandemic to demand justice for George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and, and, and…. As Lu and Steele write in “Joy is Resistance,”  “adapting strategies of song, signifying and storytelling online, Black users affirm that joy, too, is a meaningful way to subvert oppression and extend the resilience of Black oral culture” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#lu2019"> [lu2019] </a>. However, all of these strategies are <em>active;</em> they are things we must do and work towards to get to and remain in joy. This does not account for the ways in which we should be able to sit in our joy, to simply exist and be. Under this conceptualization, joy is labor.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2021, I was able to teach a course at my institution centering Black women inthe digital and future,examining questions of fantasy, digital culture, and what could be. It attracted many students, particularly Black women undergraduates, looking for a space in which they could be intellectual rigorous about issues of personal concern and importance to them while also feeling safer than they might in other spaces. The uniqueness of the course was also indebted to its digital nature; we organized via Blackboard, our content management system, utilized a class Tumblr blog and Discord channel for communication and had weekly Zoom meetings for discussing content.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It enabled students to engage at their own pace, on their terms, and allowed for more freedom of expression.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>This course demanded a lot of me: I was called upon to think not just about how to make a classroom digital, but how to craft a unique digital classroom from the ground up. It was a situation that did not call for translation but imaginative speculation and creation. Joy became a defining characteristic of how I built that digital classroom with my students, which meant letting them use digital tools the ways they felt were intuitive which would lead to greater self-expression, offering more space for reflection with themselves and their peers. There is always much to learn from discipline, but more, I think, from freedom. As much as I learn from my Black woman graduate student peers as a young professor and thinker and writer, my ability to be insatiably curious with my students continued to push me further.</p>
<p>I argue, in the vein of Brock and Steele, that the digital ought to be a place of joy as well. As Black people, we find the ability to hold joy in tandem with pain. Lu and Steele argue that the use of particular technologies offers Black folks the ability to find and celebrate joy in the face of Black death: “Black users share and cultivate joy in ways that counter and resist the seemingly omnipresent images of Black Death that surround us” (<a href="#lu2019">831</a>). Where we congregate to celebrate and <em>be.</em> I argue that there ought to be a space in the digital for Black folks, particular Black graduate students, some of whom go on to become professors and teachers, to go without doing the labor of educating about race. Remember: resistance is labor.</p>
<p>Black Digital Humanities scholars such as André Brock, Catherine Knight Steele, Moya Bailey, Meredith Clark and more have written about the ways Black folks use these types of digital platforms as ways of recreating public spheres for them. They argue that Black folks have always used and created and played in the digital, molding it until it serves us. In creating these spaces that are meant for us to simply exist but that are also public, Black graduate student creators have given others a window into our experiences. We shift from simply being Black online to doing labor online by creating these platforms, spaces and resources for others like us because only a select few in positions of power are interested and invested in our advancement. The result: we creates the spaces and support networks we need ourselves.</p>
<p>To that end, for many scholars, racial justice is work they must do in addition. Whitmore’s podcast <em>Blk + In Grad School,</em> which has been helping scholars of color to and through their academic journeys since 2017, is in many ways periphery to her scholarship, but imperative for her wellbeing. The podcast, which has expanded into a digital network of several thousand followers on Twitter and Instagram and come to include an annual graduate school preparedness summit has formed collaborations with other Black digital content creators in graduate school, including a directory of Black graduate students blogging, vlogging, podcasting or using any means of digital methods to document their graduate school experience. Whitmore uses digital methods to create infrastructure to support Black graduate students; a strong act of resistance when one considers the myriad of ways academia gatekeeps. And yet, for all of the important infrastructure and networking labor Whitmore does in providing a place for Black graduate students to retreat, find and support each other, as the Academy stands established currently, none of this work will “count” in the eyes of a search committee or tenure committee. We, Black graduate students, know the worth of this work, however, and will attempt to continually lift it up.</p>
<p>Whitmore with <em>Blk + In Grad School</em> and Woods and Davis with #BlackInTheIvory are only two of many instances where digital resistance work manifests <em>in addition to</em> scholarship, in a manner that creates additional labor. During the 2020 uprising in Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd, which spread nationwide in the midst of a global pandemic, graduate student Vanessa Anyanso began collecting donations to buy and run supplies for protestors and other organizations<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> , using Twitter and Instagram to amplify her calls for money. At the time of this writing, Anyanso has donated nearly $20,000 worth of supplies. Dr. Autumn A. Griffin has turned to her follower base gained as a blogger and podcaster for her and Tiffany Lee&rsquo;s co-created and co-run website <em>Blackademia,</em> a network geared towards Black folks in academic spaces (not simply graduate school and higher education) to fundraise for support of various activist and community oriented organizations, including Anyanso&rsquo;s supply campaign — by selling bookmarks. While it may be tempting to dismiss such an act as “not digital humanities,” we must also remember the root of the word: digital — of or relating to the fingers. Do-It-Yourself, crafting and other prototyping and creative practices/making are at the core of digital humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mauoflude2017"> [mauoflude2017] </a>.</p>
<p>This is why the work of André Brock becomes exceptionally important. Brock’s <em>Distributed Blackness: African American Cybercultures,</em> which investigates the quotidian and libidinal pleasure of being Black online, inspires this work, as it will call for Black graduate students to pursue joy and being without negating the driving desire to present and show up online in particular ways. Brock argues the libidinal can be understood as pathos — similar, but distinct from affect<a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2019"> [brock2019] </a>. It is an energy that can be communally experienced through communicating culturally specific or shared experiences and contexts. While he also theorizes about joy, particularly in the digital, he rejects the need that it be for resistance purposes. Libidinal economy allows for us, Black people, to simply be<a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2019"> [brock2019] </a>. To sit in our emotions because we are human and we are entitled to them and for no other reason. This is, to circle back to the thesis of this article, at the core of why many Black women graduate students are turning to creating digital networks: we want to retain our joy.</p>
<p>The digital gives us space to lean into and feel the messiness of our identities and our politics. As Bailey, Jackson &amp; Welles describe for participants in the #YouOKSis hashtag, there is a feeling of catharsis associated with sharing stories and sparking conversation that may, hopefully, effect social change online [<a href="#bailey2021">2020</a>]. Black women graduate students often begin our forays into the digital as a means of self-making or finding a personal catharsis — but when we exhale, publicly, we often find many others releasing their stories and burdens as well. It&rsquo;s a shared experience that has always defined the feminisms of women of color — it simply also occurs now in the digital.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the midst of digital resistance movements and finding solidarity through shared feelings of disenchantment with the possibilities of higher education exacerbated by a global pandemic, joy has been in short supply. Black women’s participation in resistance efforts — whether it be antiracist demonstrations, actions against gender violence, living wage campaigns, etc. — challenge the impartiality and objectivity the Academy would have us believe we must uphold. The Academy is not neutral. The Academy is not exempt from oppressive practices. And as its Black graduate students are shining a mirror up to the gatekeepers so as to show every fault line and crack in the Ivory Tower as we know it, we still make space for those who will come after us.</p>
<p>Digital practices like the ones I’ve explored here are often the brainchildren of Black women and queer graduate students, following a pattern of activism and advocating for our people that has existed for centuries. If we listen (or read) carefully, we will see that conversations about living wages for graduate students, the ability to find supportive mentorship, pedagogical innovation, restructuring our tenure system, responding to racism in the classroom, creating physical spaces for ourselves, our wellness in spite of working within an institution promotes productivity over health are all taking place online every day. Necessity breeds innovation.</p>
<p>Where we conclude is with the realization and acceptance that Black women graduate students are doing the work of dismantling, learning and unlearning in the digital that, hopefully, will help scholars envision a new means of knowledge production that makes space for that which has existed at the margins of the institution. We are doing the work of resistance, which includes tending to our joy and prioritizing celebration, but also giving ourselves the freedom to be ourselves online, and making room for freer generations to come.</p>

<p>I extend gratitude to Dr. Tamara Wilkerson Dias and Dr. Autumn Adia Griffin, two Black Twitter friends who had recently finished or was finishing their graduate programs, for sending encouraging gifts during my comprehensive exams. Black women graduate students and early career scholars have forwarded my name for specific writing opportunities, some of my first in academia. Steven Nelson, Mary Shelley and I began a pandemic watch of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender,</em> which grew to include more people, in particular Black women graduate students who needed moments of levity as we attempted to finish our programs during a global health crisis. As more folks gathered, we continued to watch more shows together, changing the hashtag each time for <em>Legend of Korra, She-Ra and the Princess of Power,</em> and <em>Steven Universe.</em> And Allanté Whitmore of <em>Blk + In Grad School</em> has been particularly diligent about including Black women graduate students on her podcast and during her year Grad School Success Summit.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><em>Caribbean Women Healers: Decolonizing Knowledge Within Afro-Indigenous Traditions</em> , is a multi-year collaborative research project developed by Dr. Alaí Reyes-Santos and Dr. Ana-Maurine Lara, funded, and supported by the University of Oregon; and co-produced with digital librarians and technical professionals from the UO Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Services (DSS) department under the leadership of Kate Thornhill, Digital Scholarship Librarian, and Franny Gaede, Director, Digital Scholarship Services.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This digital humanities project contributes to existing Black Digital Humanities by centering deep-listening and digital decolonization methodologies that prioritize human dignity, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), and data stewardship. More specifically, <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> highlights how Afro-Indigenous (Black and Black-Indigenous) women elders mobilize their intergenerational knowledge and roles as healers, teachers, and community leaders within Caribbean healing traditions to effect change well beyond the traditional centers of those communities.</p>
<p>In 2016, after four years of meeting and spending time with Caribbean women that keep their Afro-Indigenous, Indigenous and Afro-descendant healing traditions alive, Reyes-Santos and Lara were inspired to conceptualize a project that validates healers’ knowledge in a world where Eurocentric notions of health and medicine vilify and dismiss them. As healers and ceremonialists, themselves, Reyes-Santos and Lara’s journeys within Caribbean communities throughout the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Pacific Northwest region, seeks to interrogate and to interrupt the colonial gaze that historically vilifies and demeans our elders asuneducated,orsimple,orprimitive,and that deems their knowledge simplyfolklore,popular religion,orsupersitition.</p>
<p>As a space pushing back at these settler mentalities, <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> documents Afro-Indigenous, Afro-descendant, and Indigenous healing within a TEK context that includes preserving food and medicine forests and gathering grounds, transmitting traditional food and medicine knowledge to others, caring for and treating their families, and members of their communities. Healing work includes attending to people who seek help with the health of their lands, plants, animals and human bodies. Healing entails attending to physical, emotional, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions of health and well-being. As such, the healers documented for this project also manage encyclopedic, communally-sustained knowledge of spiritual traditions kept alive in spite of colonial and nation-states’ attempts to disappear and vilify them. The healing practices and ethnobotanical knowledge disseminated through this digital humanities project are legacies of survival strategies in the face of colonization and slavery, anti-Black racism, and anti-Indigenous genocidal practices.</p>
<p><em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> is informed by the positionality of its researchers, two Black-Indigenous women who are a third generationcuranderaand tradition keeper from Puerto Rico (Reyes-Santos) and a fifth generationcuranderaand tradition keeper from the Dominican Republic (Lara), both living in the Pacific Northwest.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The researchers’ own rootedness in relationships with elders and healers were central to the relationships that were developed prior to and will continue to be maintained after the project. The healer partnerships cultivated and traditional ecological knowledge documented by Reyes-Santos and Lara are represented by digital artifacts captured using sound, video, and photography. Taking lead responsibility for website conceptualization, writing and digital artifact creation, layout ideation, and conduit between the healers, Reyes-Santos’ and Lara’s direction positioned <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> to be one for and about the healers’ traditional ecological knowledge.</p>
<p>Core to the project’s digital development was DSS’ specialization in co-creating open digital humanities projects that center cultural awareness through web development and design, online privacy, open source and proprietary web application development and management, and data stewardship. The library research team included Thornhill as digital project manager; Gaede as project administrator; Anna Lepska as graduate student digital research assistant; Azle Malinao-Alvarez as the interactive technology consultant with support from digital collections and preservation expert Julia Simic, as well as Corey Gillen and Ray Henry, members of the UO Libraries’ Library Technology Services department (now Applications Development and Integration). This library team will henceforth be referred to collectively asthe buildersthe authors of this paperthe authors,and Reyes-Santos and Larathe researchers.This interdisciplinary team placed the healers’ community at the center of the research project to publicly validate and share aspects of their knowledge with the healers, teachers, researchers, and students studying race, indigeneity, ethnobotanical medicinal healing, and intersectionality.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-the-project">History of the Project</h2>
<p>Since 2010, as Afro-Indigenous ceremonialists and scholars working in the fields of Black and Indigenous Studies, Reyes-Santos and Lara have collaborated in Afro-Indigenous survival and revitalization projects, ethnographic research projects, and on another digital project. They have spent the past eleven years travelling to Indigenous, Afro-descendant, and Afro-Indigenous ritual, healing, and ceremonial spaces in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the United States. While participating in and collaborating with these spaces, they have become students, apprentices, and allies working with elders to continue disseminating and valorizing their traditional knowledge through visits, fundraising, workshops, ceremonies, and academic research. For instance, in 2012, Lara and Reyes-Santos fundraised and planned a visit of Mexica elders to sacred sites in the Dominican Republic, where they met Afro-Indigenous healers and ritual leaders; in 2012, the Black Feminist Retreat in the Dominican Republic brought together U.S.-based Black scholars and artists, and activists, cultural workers, and traditional ceremonialists living in the Dominican Republic; in 2015, they also organized a trip of Mexica and Mezcalero Apache elders to meet Cuban <em>regla de ocha</em> communities in Havana. Both these events are examples of the kind of exchanges they have helped bring to fruition as efforts to disseminate and exchange traditional healing knowledge across Indigenous, Afro-descendant, and Afro-Indigenous communities in the Americas.</p>
<p>They began to experiment with digital platforms as powerful tools to share information early on. In 2011 they interviewed Dominican feminist and queer activists on educational justice; Reyes-Santos edited short films documenting their experiences, and posted them to a YouTube channel. In 2017, Lara trained students in Reyes-Santos’ class in ethnographic methodologies to participate in a storytelling documentation trip in the wake of Hurricane Maria and create educational resources for the<a href="https://blogs.uoregon.edu/theuopuertoricoproject/">University of Oregon Puerto Rico Project</a>. Some students travelled to Puerto Rico with Reyes-Santos, took photos documenting the catastrophe and how people organized themselves as communities, and completed interviews with people affected by the Hurricane in mostly rural areas. A student team edited content and created a blog to educate people in the Pacific Northwest about Puerto Rico’s history and to disseminate the stories shared by people in the island.</p>
<p>In 2018, the UO Libraries launched the DSS Faculty Grants Program. As an internal university award, UO faculty were eligible to apply for in-kind and budget support offered by DSS, and its sister library departments, for scholars to explore non-traditional and creative digital scholarship through either through a humanities, social science, or interdisciplinary lens. As a major strategic priority for the department, <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> was selected because of its innovative approach to raising the voices of historically marginalized and colonized voices. It was also selected because DSS wanted to explore the question, “How might the sustainability of a digital project be conceptualized from a standpoint that considers humanity as a social construction and subject to change over time and place?” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gallon2016"> [gallon2016] </a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> <a href="https://healers.uoregon.edu/">WordPress site</a>contains over 200 photographs and interview clips with eight healers, highlighting various research sites and depicting biodiversity in botanical plant life in different micro-climates and ecological areas. The website gives context for how Reyes-Santos and Lara partnered with healers and how the healers’ knowledge and approaches to sharing influenced the research’s overall ethnographic practices. Additionally, the site includes a digital map highlighting research sites and an extensive bibliography that introduces a variety of texts that serve as an introduction to the study of Afro-Indigenous communities in the Caribbean, and their spiritual and traditional ecological knowledges. And on April 22, 2020, the website celebrated its launch with over 70 people in attendance globally virtually attending on Zoom.</p>
<h2 id="contextualizing-_caribbean-women-healers_-in-black-dh">Contextualizing <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> in Black DH</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Openness is a concept that has come to characterize knowledge and communication systems, epistemologies, society and politics, institutions or organizations, and individual personalities. In essence, openness in all these dimensions refers to a kind of transparency which is the opposite of secrecy and most often this transparency is seen in terms of access to information especially within organizations, institutions or societies.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#peters2015"> [peters2015] </a><br>
In order to allow democratic collaboration, co-design, co-creation, co-management, and co-evaluation through the Internet, openness emphasizes free, transparent, and unrestricted access to knowledge and information. Within the digital humanities, openness situates scholars to be self-aware and confront socio-technologic and economic frameworks that influence their research and teaching practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As digital cultural heritage materials have become more common online, in large part thanks to funding through private and grant funding agencies and foundations (e.g. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Institute of Library and Information Science), openness has become a norm for those working in custodial<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sas2021"> [sas2021] </a>and post-custodial<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sas2021b"> [sas2021b] </a>digital stewardship<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sas2021c"> [sas2021c] </a>.</p>
<p>The relationships between openness, data, digital technologies, and Black and Indigenous studies demonstrate how digital technologies and data privilege white Western cultural traditions and power systems that systematically oppress human beings, societies, and cultures through violence, genocide, racism, and enslavement.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gallon2016"> [gallon2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#lothian2013"> [lothian2013] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#risam2016"> [risam2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#christen2019"> [christen2019] </a>. The rejection of those oppressive traditions and power systems have given rise to a number of Black Digital Humanities archival projects that curate and provide public access to documents, maps, and other historical, material and textual materials.<a href="http://carisealand.org/"> <em>The Caribbean Sea &amp; Land Project</em> </a>demonstrates the relevance of mapping and sharing historical and cultural information in accessible and interactive formats, specifically when engaging Black and Indigenous Caribbean populations. It incorporates a digital map to share geographical and historical information about different islands in the Eastern Caribbean.<a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org/"> <em>Slave Voyages</em> </a>;<a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/black-history/"> <em>Black British History on Record</em> </a>; <em><a href="http://firstblacks.org/en/">First Blacks in the Americas</a></em> ; and the <em><a href="https://ecda.northeastern.edu/">Early Caribbean Digital Archive</a></em> , among others, illustrate how geographies and public access to historical records play a central role in Black DH practices.</p>
<p>The diasporic and transnational realities of Black communities, and the legacy of slavery and the Middle Passage, present those of us in the Black DH with opportunities to create platforms that represent transcolonial and transnational realities beyond textual representation, while incorporating different communities and learning styles. <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> joins in the oral digital storytelling practices that characterizes projects such as <em><a href="https://www.noneonrecord.com/">None on Record;</a></em>  <em><a href="http://exhibitions.nypl.org/africansindianocean/index2.php">African Diaspora in the Indian Ocean World</a></em> ; and <em><a href="https://crbb.tcu.edu/">Civil Rights in Black &amp; Brown</a></em> ; and initiatives like the <em><a href="http://www.caribbeanmemoryproject.com/explore.html#/">Caribbean Memory Project</a></em> that foster public participation and co-creation of digital archives by Caribbean people.</p>
<p>Aligned with these Black DH projects, and as scholars who seek to work in the open, we seek to apply decolonizing methodologies connected to the ontologies of openness: access, transparency, collaboration, sharing, accessibility, and the choice of permanence. <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> frames humanity within the context of historical colonial violence and the oppression of Afro-Indigenous people. It subverts the colonial gaze by giving respect, space, and validation for TEK through its imagery, interviews, and bilingual nature. A core attribute of this digital project is its approach to the openness of sharing and documenting TEK. This project’s knowledge work is rooted in authors’ participatory ethnographic documentary, Black Feminist, and open decolonization methodologies for working with TEK.</p>
<p>For the authors, this means centering participant’s dignity and cultural practices, and rejecting white, Western settler supremacy ways of being. Ownership and custody of digital technologies and digital cultural heritage is a core issue for how the authors operated throughout the project as researchers and builders.

Centering the healer community&rsquo;s individual choice, cultural access protocols, and applying their own deep listening practices was the highest priority.</p>
<p>Reyes-Santos and Lara’s emphasis on Afro-Indigenous narratives honors the historical reality of <em>palenques</em> and <em>manieles</em> , sovereign communities where Indigenous and African peoples came together in freedom; where Indigenous peoples shared herbal, medicinal knowledge with recently arrived Africans; where African communities shared their ancestral healing and ceremonial knowledges, and found ways to retain their traditions far away from home; where Indigenous and African peoples came together in kin relations and treaty building. Their methodology honors the Afro-Indigenous paths of resistance that have enabled the maintenance and dissemination of traditional healing practices and ecological knowledge for 528 years. The healers featured in <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> are steeped in these histories and the traditions born out of them. The methodologies used for this project enabled this to come into being, and how, specifically, these methodologies and website contribute to breaking down the marginalization of Black Digital Humanities.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gallon2016"> [gallon2016] </a></p>
<p>As Afro-Indigenous communities gain visibility, this project initiates what must be a broader dialogue in Black DH about what it means to bridge the concerns of Black and Indigenous methodologies and community needs in the U.S. and internationally for the successful implementation of open scholarship projects. It foregrounds Black Feminist DH practice deeply informed by Indigenous decolonial methodologies for community-based research applied to the digital sphere. The methodological approach to the stories and ethnobotanical resources shared on the site and digital stewardship techniques draw from the norms for social interactions and information sharing exemplified by the healers themselves, as well as healers’ intentions.</p>
<p>The project was always meant to be open, shared beyond the healer and scholarly communities from whence it came. It has been motivated by the needs and desires of the healers themselves. All community participants were excited and saw a need to make traditional knowledge available through new technologies. Rather than see the Internet as a hindrance to their world and belief systems, they articulated an understanding that presenting their work and knowledge to the world was a way to safeguard them and their knowledge. Healers, like the Cuban-American <em>Iyalocha</em> Jannes Martínez, were specific in their critique of what they saw as decontextualized traditional knowledge permeating the Internet. Technological access acts as a supplement to relationship and practice. As Jannes stated in her interview with Reyes-Santos and Lara, “Reading something on the internet doesn’t mean you know it and understand it.”</p>
<p>Many of those who participated, in particular those from Puerto Rico and those living in rural areas in the Dominican Republic, stated there has been a rupture to traditional forms of knowledge transmission and production. They theorize that these ruptures are produced by three primary factors:</p>
<p>social violence that produces early death, expressed in the saying, “la muerte es parte de la vida” (death is a part of life);rapid emigration from their communities to urban centers and to other countries expressed in the statement “el campo se está vaciando” (the countryside is being emptied);fundamentalist Christian religious social values and norms that demonize Afro-Indigenous/Black traditions and practices.</p>
<p>Their theories speak to scholarly findings in the field of Black Studies and Reyes-Santos and Lara’s engagement with the field. Reyes-Santos and Lara understand that the social violences discussed by healers as the reason behind “early death” are an extension of colonial-modern state policies that fail to produce the conditions for sustaining Black life, as well as colonial-modern ideas about race, gender and sexuality that foster the punishment of gender and sexual difference, and the devaluation of Blackness. (Wynter 2003) Neoliberal economic policies and state participation in globalized capitalism have contributed to rapid urban migration and emigration to Latin America, Europe and North America that have left rural areas depopulated and/or disenfranchised, and elders caring for land and knowledge on their own<a class="footnote-ref" href="#reyessantos2015"> [reyessantos2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#thomas2013"> [thomas2013] </a>.</p>
<p>Ethnographic and historical research by Lara documents that Christian colonial violence leads to the ongoing ostracization of traditional healers, the demonization of Afro-Indigenous practices and traditions, the dismantling of altars and the destruction of sacred sites<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lara2020"> [lara2020] </a>. Even with all of these obstacles, and perhaps because of them, healers expressed the need to continue transmitting knowledge to their families, communities and future generations. That impulse has shaped this project from beginning to end. Moreover, the fact that both Reyes-Santos and Lara are themselves Afro-Indigenous Caribbean healers and keepers of traditional ceremonies opened up spaces for connection with elders, for sharing and meeting healers in ceremony, and understanding the worldviews articulated by the healers in multiple Caribbean traditions. Often, once Reyes-Santos and Lara were recognized as healers and ceremonialists, a deeper conversation ensued with interviewees.</p>
<p>As stated by Winona LaDuke, “Traditional ecological knowledge is the culturally and spiritually based way in which Indigenous peoples relate to their ecosystems.” Here we highlight how Afro-descendant and Afro-Indigenous communities have a wealth of resources to contribute to TEK in the Americas. Our Black Feminist DH approach required that the authors be willing to be transformed by the people Reyes-Santos and Lara were honoring in the documentation process; Reyes-Santos and Lara had to be open to transform how they imagined the work, how at times they were trained to undertake this kind of endeavor. The researchers centered Black/Afro-descendant women and queer healers’ voices and ways of knowing, while destabilizing colonial distinctions between researchers and research subjects<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mclaurin2001"> [mclaurin2001] </a>.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#simmons2001"> [simmons2001] </a>The authors had to become research subjects as well; all of us from our specific social and academic location observing how we responded to systems of knowledge that have historically been rendered invalid in academic setting: Black, Indigenous, female, queer, healer, oral, collective.</p>
<p>Healers, researchers, and builders were engaged in a collaborative process of knowledge production to together imagine what would be the best ways of representing the information on the website. We privileged oral transmission of knowledge over archives while still providing access to relevant archival projects, scholarship, creative work, and educational tools. We recognized the orality that characterizes interactions with healers and the relevance of sustaining oral traditions in the contemporary moment; specifically, honoring how women and queer people have maintained traditional ecological and medicinal knowledge alive while facing high levels of social vulnerability and violence whether in the Caribbean or the U.S.</p>
<p>As articulated by Moya Bailey, “The ways in which identities inform both theory and practice in digital humanities have been largely overlooked. Those already marginalized in society and the academy can also find themselves in the liminal spaces of this field. By centering the lives of women, people of color, and disabled folks, the types of possible conversations in digital humanities shift. The move “<a href="http://www.charisbooksandmore.com/book/9780896086135">from margin to center</a>” offers the opportunity to engage new sets of theoretical questions that expose implicit assumptions about what and who counts in digital humanities as well as exposes structural limitations that are the inevitable result of an unexamined identity politics of whiteness, masculinity, and ablebodiness” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2011"> [bailey2011] </a>.</p>

<h2 id="healer-community-centric-methodology-and-their-impact-on-the-project">Healer Community-Centric Methodology and Their Impact on the Project</h2>
<p>This research project provides a powerful counterpoint to the context in which Afro-Indigenous traditions are being maintained and practiced. The aforementioned dynamics not only generate interruptions in inter-generational transmission of traditional ecological and spiritual knowledges. They are also reflective of a socio-political context in which Afro-Indigenous traditions and ways of knowing are marginalized. As thecampos, the countryside,empty out,traditional land bases and community spaces are increasingly threatened. As economic marginalization increases, Black people, Afro-Indigenous healers have to become even more creative in figuring out ways to gather the medicines that they need, collect the materials for their offerings, and develop paths to find each other.</p>
<p>Very much aligned with Reyes-Santos and Lara’s approaches to working with the healers, the authors’ awareness of socio-political sensitivities heavily influenced the digital treatments of spoken word, portraits, plant location data, Internet access, and website design worked to not reinforce the harms brought upon Afro-Indigenous communities. Together, healer, researcher, and builder methodologies sought to subvert the western-centric approach to using digital tools for tools and innovations and putting something on the Internet for the sake of making information publicly available. It was important for the authors to always ask questions of the community regarding access, transparency, collaboration, sharing, accessibility, and the choice of permanence. Ultimately, the authors’ approach first foregrounded permission and consent knowing that not all information should be free and open. Centering the healer community&rsquo;s individual choice and cultural access protocols was their first priority.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2016, Reyes-Santos and Lara conducted interviews with women healers in rural and urban communities in the Dominican Republic, the Pacific Northwest, Cuba and Puerto Rico. In these interviews, they focused on the world views of their elders. Their research approaches were (and continue to be) grounded in a critical Indigenous approach<a class="footnote-ref" href="#smith2011"> [smith2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cole2001"> [cole2001] </a>whereby the elders determined the parameters of shared knowledge, and in conjunction with us, determined the kinds of questions and methods by which those questions would be answered. This approach was not only critical, it was absolutely required. As younger women engaged in respectful relation with elders, Reyes-Santos and Lara could open the possibility of conversation, but the elders were the ones who would determine what it was that Reyes-Santos and Lara should, could and needed to know.</p>
<p>Critically engaged methods include the collection of oral histories,<a class="footnote-ref" href="#smith2011"> [smith2011] </a>observant participation,<a class="footnote-ref" href="#campbell2014"> [campbell2014] </a>and transparent data collection<a class="footnote-ref" href="#smith2011"> [smith2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#simpson2014"> [simpson2014] </a>in ways that prioritized the locations and points of views of their elders. Gathering this knowledge took place in the midst of healing sessions, at family gatherings, hanging out in peoples’ patios, at the dinner table, at dance parties, hiking, resting, and just spending time together,compartiendo. They spoke withregla de ochapriestesses,servidoras of la 21 división,sobadoras, and other healers drawing from their Indigenous and Afro-descendant ancestral knowledge; women they have met while dancing at the rhythm of Caribbean batá or atabales drums, or just walking down the street in a place that was new to them. Reyes-Santos and Lara were also attentive to including queer/two-spirit healers living in the Diaspora, whose own geographies include healing communities in the U.S. and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>These initial methods soon transformed into a practice of deep listening. The first thing Reyes-Santos and Lara were taught was deep listening. Over the last decade, they have learned to understand deep listening as a practice that is central to the pedagogical methods of Caribbean religious traditions. It involves listening with the whole body, to what is articulated and unarticulated, and paying attention to what is seen and not seen. Deep listening is about observing collective ritual behaviors and the utterances that take place between people. To listen deeply is to be a part of, extending beyond ethnographic participant observation and into the realm of being in loving community. To listen deeply is to listen to dreams, to listen to “the counsel of spirits and ancestors,” to dance to music, and to be present to the ups and downs of their elders’ (and their families’) lives.</p>
<p>Deep listening changed Reyes-Santos and Lara as researchers because it changed their orientations tobeing,to space-time, and to their own relations. It required prioritizing recording the conversation in the format most comfortable to the healers; to undertake interviews healers with husbands, children, neighbors, or patients around us or while on a hike through a forest in the middle of a hot tropical morning. Deep listening is about being embedded in everyday living, to listen to the cacophony of voices, noises, landscapes where healing takes place. Beyond the initial interview, Reyes-Santos and Lara were kept accountable to this practice by continued check-ins and visits with healers. Their relationships transcend the timeline of the project.</p>
<p>By engaging in a practice of deep listening, Reyes-Santos and Lara first learned that all of the elders have unique and powerful understandings of the divine, known variously as Bondieu, Papa Dios, Olofi, Ometeotl and Gran Espíritu. They learned about the unspoken understandings of elders’ relationships to ancestors and to all living beings, which are the primary sites for healing. They learned about the parameters of what is consideredaliveanddead(e.g. all of existence is alive, but plastic is dead). They learned about the context in which life is prolonged and death is accepted — or not. They learned about how current economic, political and social conditions are understood in relationship to the prolongation and/or decimation of the lives of elders, their families, their communities, and the land itself. They learned that in different traditions healing is directed either towards the prolongation of life or toward the aversion of death. These distinct orientations translate into relationships with the plant world, relationships with the spirit and ancestral worlds, and relationships to living, breathing human beings.</p>
<p>In addition to deeply listening, Reyes-Santos and Lara also walked. Miriam Ricourt describes walking as a practice of disruption and meaning-making that was and continues to be a central praxis of maroon peoples (cimarrones). Walking was critical to their understanding of elders’ worlds. They walked with them through their communities, as seen in Figure 1, through their forests, within their churches, homes, and ceremonial grounds. Walking together, and being together in walking, allowed all present to assert our mutual humanity (everyone was hot) and limitations (when one person got tired — usually Reyes-Santos or Lara, much to the amusement of those who could keep going). Walking together allowed Reyes-Santos and Lara to understand how elders move through space and why. Walking enabled Reyes-Santos and Lara to understand the elders’ specific geographies — the trees, plants, and places where they make meaning on an on-going basis, the ways they tended these spaces, and the sense of loss that is an increasing part of the human experience in the face of rapid climate change. In walking together, Reyes-Santos photographed plants, groups of plants, and Lara asked questions that prompted stories about specific places.</p>

<p>There were stories of disappeared species, of disappeared peoples, of new constructions and new economic forces. There were stories of successful healings and of challenging circumstances. There were stories of plants transplanted and of the spirits who lived among them. All of this was possible to learn when they walked together.</p>
<p>Deep listening and walking required Reyes-Santos and Lara to shift their emphasis from video clips in the original prospectus to audio clips that are not clear of contextual noise. The microphone often created an uncomfortable situation in spaces where knowledge is mostly produced through communal conversation, questions, and interactions with the human world and plants. Most of the women interviewed did not feel comfortable being recorded on video and shared their most insightful stories while receiving patients or taking a stroll to show specific plants.</p>
<p>To produce a website with equal representation, Reyes-Santos and Lara decided to privilege audio over video to share information. Audio clips are short and speak to specific, relevant themes. They worked with an editor who was asked to leave contextual noise in the recordings to enable the listener to understand what it was like to be in conversation with the healer in their everyday practice and subtly convey the context. Reyes-Santos and Lara are not documentary filmmakers and were aware they were not seeking to produce documentary-quality material. They were documenting some of the wealth of knowledge they have received over the years from elders and share that knowledge respectfully with others seeking to value it, research it, and connect with it. The material on the website allows us all to reflect on how we have come to construe knowledge in the Americas and what our elders have to offer as humanity approaches a variety of social and environmental challenges.</p>
<p>Working with elders in a transparent way that honors the sacrifices they continue to make to sustain their knowledge means that everything presented on the website has been discussed with them. Reyes-Santos and Lara printed photographs, shared audio clips and received the authorization to continue not just from the elders, but also from the guardian spirits that guide them. This multi-layered process of knowledge ratification extends beyond the ethical boundaries of university human subjects committees and is directly and permanently rooted in the ethical parameters of Afro-Indigenous traditions themselves. </p>
<p>Researching within and with traditional ceremonial and healing communities carries with it the ethical obligation to not only cause no harm, but the additional ethical obligation of honoring the self-determination and affective and spiritual priorities of Afro-Indigenous communities. Reyes-Santos and Lara presented these values in a slide show format in the website. Together, these values articulate a different set of ethical values underlying community engaged digital humanities scholarship. These values place Black voices, ways of knowing, ways of being and ways of teaching front and center within the digital sphere, rupturing “implicit assumptions about what and who counts in digital humanities” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2011"> [bailey2011] </a>. The values that undergird an ethical code of conduct among the healers included in the project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antes que todo, Dios. (Gracias a la Misericordia): Humility before Creation, and all beings – human, plant and animal – are a manifestation of Creation</li>
<li>Todo Vive.: All of Earth is alive; All of Earth is life.</li>
<li>Moyumba/Ancestros: To honor ancestors and elders and all those who have come before us.</li>
<li>Obedi ka ka, obedi le le.: Knowldege was shared throughout the world.</li>
<li>Convivir.: To be in relation with each other across a long span of time.</li>
<li>Compartir.: To generate intimacy and authenticity in our relations through storytelling, laughter, sitting together, eating together, etc.</li>
<li>Cara a Cara.: To see each other’s faces, to know the truth of our experiences in each other’s gazes/eyes/faces</li>
<li>Ser generosa.: To never arrive empty handed, to never let someone leave empty handed, either.</li>
<li>Ser recíproca.: Enabling balance in the universe between all living beings, material and immaterial, even in the creation of knowledge.</li>
<li>Hay que fluir.: To be flexible and easy-going in the rhythms of life’s chaos and unexpected events.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the beginning Reyes-Santos and Lara knew that they wanted <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> to be primarily used as a site of knowledge production and transfer for practitioners, students, and the general public. They wanted it to be a place for the provision of resources and to function as a teaching tool. Construction of the digital project formally started at the beginning of the 2019-2020 academic year with the goal of launch on Earth Day 2020. Collaboratively the project builders helped address digital technology platforms and we began conversations about web design and digital assets management and its representation, with an emphasis on the protection of community as part of open digital practice. Because the researchers wanted to create a multimodal digital research project, the builders listened to the researchers speak about their ideas and aspirations, interviewing them on questions of visual design, ownership, and digital content representation. This gave the builders a sense of what types of website user interactions and reader experiences were to be anticipated while navigating the website. Throughout the conversations, the builders were able to help prioritize target audiences while also learning about what types of digital assets were being created with and for healer stories, and how Reyes and Lara wanted users to experience text, audio, images, and geographic space.</p>
<p>The questions asked by the builders (Appendix A) helped to inform approaches to the overall digital stewardship and web development approach to the project. By applying these questions that were inspired by National Endowment for the Humanities recommendations for data management plan<a class="footnote-ref" href="#neh2018"> [neh2018] </a>, user interactions and collections management for ethnographic archives,<a class="footnote-ref" href="#punzalan2017"> [punzalan2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#christen2018"> [christen2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#christen2019"> [christen2019] </a>, and web accessibility standards to support people with disabilities and cultural awareness<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wwwc2020"> [wwwc2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#williams2012"> [williams2012] </a>, the answers helped determine what would be the best socio-technical infrastructure for the digital project’s future sustainability.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-technology-in-use">Understanding the Technology in Use</h2>
<p>The technologies used to build <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> were selected based on the builders’ collective professional experiences developing and managing digital library and archival services and public humanities projects within higher education and expertise in cultural heritage digital stewardship. Throughout the project, the builders approached construction to prioritize cultural needs, web accessibility, and long-term social-technologic sustainability framed within a digital assets and software preservation context, a framing that requires constant digital curation and software monitoring. They needed to balance technology selection and choices in methodologies that would align with the values of the project as well as ones that allowed a small build team to manage the project without fear of losing platform technical support beyond their capabilities. Another requirement was robust user support documentation for all digital tools so researchers could continue maintenance if the builders were no longer available.</p>
<p>At the University of Oregon, WordPress and the premium theme Divi are available as a Software as a Service enterprise technology solution through the vendor CampusPress. The project’s digital assets and written content representation, usability, and arrangement, flexibility for responsive web design and visual design, and the ability to have interactive media embedded in the site were foundational technical requirements. The batch upload and extraction of embedded descriptive metadata from digital images were important for digital project workflows and possible in WordPress. The platform also needed to allow for embed streaming audio-visual assets hosted on a third-party streaming media service, and store at least 1 GB of data. The UO’s campus agreement with CampusPress meant the digital technologies were vetted by the university for ADA-compliance (WCAG 2.0 Level AA) and other campus privacy and security records requirements. WordPress is commonly used by the DH community<a class="footnote-ref" href="#digitalhumanitiesintiative2020"> [digitalhumanitiesintiative2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#coble2021"> [coble2021] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#dirt2018"> [dirt2018] </a>, and the research team had experience using it. Divi has a number of accessibility tools built-in and this set-up is compatible with the toolkit we use to build and evaluate projects, including the Accessible Color Palette Builder, the WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool, and Toltap Colorblind Web Page Filter.</p>
<p>Interviews for <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> are hosted on the streaming media service Panopto. Like WordPress, this tool was vetted by the University for ADA-compliance and other privacy and security requirements. For the project, we required robust sharing and permission access controls, as well as the ability to make transcripts and captions available. Using Panopto, the builders created embed codes so the interviews could be embedded in iframes on the website. The builders also added ADA-compliant PDF transcriptions and translations, as well as closed captions in .srt files. In Figure 2, you can see a screenshot of a healer interview playing in Panopto with translated closed captions, a transcription, and interactive timestamps.</p>

<p>The map requirements for this project included the ability to embed it within the project site and have the ability to operate like a tour and simulation of moving from one country, as seen in Figure 3, Cuba, to another – a rupture to the borders produced through our modern nation-states. The tool also allowed builders to make web accessibility modifications for universal user experience using the HTML tags. At the time of the build, StoryMapsJS hosted by the Northwestern University Knight Lab met this requirement.</p>

<p>The digital assets created for this research project included audio files, digital images, and textual documents. All digital files and metadata associated with them required specific tools for creation, manipulation, file interoperability, and ability to meet digital preservation standards supported by the United States National Archives and Records Administration.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#nationalarchives2019"> [nationalarchives2019] </a>Beginning with the audio files, Audacity was used for editing the healers’ full-length interviews and conversion into .mp3 files. Adobe Photoshop and Bridge were used for resizing and reformatting of JPGs. They were also used to embed photographic descriptive metadata aligned with IPTC and DublinCore standards. Additionally for digital images, EXIF Tool was used to analyze and extract embedded technical metadata before making them web ready and available on the project site. Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat Pro were used to create ADA-compliance PDFs of interview transcriptions and translations.</p>
<h2 id="open-digital-stewardship-as-methodology-supporting-decolonization">Open Digital Stewardship as Methodology Supporting Decolonization</h2>
<p>Digital stewardship, also called data stewardship, is framed within a research data management and archival context it is the creation and management of digital objects over a lifecycle involving the creation, appraisal and selection, ingest, preservation actions, digital storage, access and reuse, and transformation (Digital Curation Centre 2021). Rooted in library and archival information science practice, digital stewardship calls for digital practitioners to curate and preserve digital files, and the metadata or information that gives said files context and meaning, with the goal of long-term access and on-going preservation planning that avoids technological obsolescence. Traditionally applied only to digital asset management or research data management spaces, digital stewardship can extend to the software access and preservation with the goal of supporting organizational decision practices associated with the development, maintenance, and preservation of technological infrastructures<a class="footnote-ref" href="#spn2021"> [spn2021] </a>. Digital stewardship at its core works to avoid and prevent information loss while making sure digital assets and software are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gofair2021"> [gofair2021] </a>.</p>
<p><em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> is an example of applying decolonizing methodologies to approaches in digital stewardship. The documentary of cultural heritage and spiritual practices situated the research team to be self-aware and confront western centric socio-technologic and economic frameworks that influenced how they applied digital methodologies to the project’s digital design, construction, and the treatment of traditional ecological knowledge and indigenous healers&rsquo; voices. Calling back to the ontologies of openness; access, transparency, collaboration, sharing, accessibility, and the choice of permanence all have place within the decolonization of traditional digital stewardship practices rooted in traditional archival custodial practices.</p>
<p>The central frame for the research team’s work is to center the dignity and respect the cultural practices of the people with whom they are working. Toward that goal, the team worked to maintain transparency with each other and asked what can be difficult questions regarding access, collaboration, sharing, accessibility, and the choice of permanence.</p>
<p>Speaking first to transparency, it was important to acknowledge the white hegemony of academia, libraries, and the digital space, and the potential for intellectual violence when white researchers enter the Black research space. Within the team, we sought to forestall this by centering the healers, the researchers, their voices, methodologies, and the values shared. We also maintained a regular meeting schedule to continue to discuss all aspects of site design and implementation as wireframes and interactive prototypes were created. Throughout this collaborative process, issues regarding the site’s overall layout, navigation, and missed pages and content were remediated together.</p>
<p>Access connects to intellectual property ownership and custody, readability and interpretations within cultural contexts, and public access to the project. Designing <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> to be freely available for anyone to access over the Internet meant critically thinking about the impact access to TEK would have on the healers and website visitors. As a research team, it was always the goal to make the website available for educational use and give space for sharing healer knowledge. Creative Commons was discussed, but determined not to be appropriate because the researchers and community only wanted information to be permitted in an educational environment all the while retaining their copyright to the digital assets and project as a whole. Together the team selected RightsStatements.org “In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted”. It is not intended for licensing, but captures the researchers’ intention and the agreement with the healers, as well as being reader-friendly as opposed to intense legal-ese or complicated rights holder statements.</p>
<p>These examples associated with access are also ones of collaboration, another tenant of openness. The project team worked by respecting each other&rsquo;s expertise and centering collaboration with the community, asking many questions and prioritizing culturally aware and accessible design that could only be planned, built, and maintained with the support and expertise of the full interdisciplinary team. In supporting the web design for cultural awareness, Reyes-Santos and Lara discussed with the building team what colors, symbols, and visual characteristics were appropriate and which could not be used, such as the color red. Using these guidelines, Malinao-Alvarez and Thornhill worked together to create an accessibility-compliant color palette and style guide, as seen in Figure 4, to shape the feel of the site.</p>

<p>Ensuring Spanish access to the website was critical because the majority of healers are monolingual Spanish speakers, and similarly, a major audience for the website was the English-speaking student body of the University of Oregon for whom we would need to transcribe and translate the healers’ Spanish language knowledge and interviews.</p>
<p>For both groups, it is important for them to hear the words used by the communities themselves to name the plants they use for healing; to have their plant knowledge validated throughout the site and for others to learn such names. This was a major reason why the research team declined to use the Latin scientific or English terms for the plants. The sixteen interview clips on the website were selected and edited from full-length interviews, first by undergraduate research assistant Miguel Perez and then by Thornhill after Perez needed to leave the project. When artificial intelligence captioning services from Panopto and Zoom proved unable to provide Spanish transcriptions for the edited clips, first Perez, then Thornhill created transcriptions, which we contracted with Rev.com for English translations. After having graduate assistant Lepska, Reyes-Santos, and Lara review these translations for quality assurance, future transcriptions and translations were performed by Transcription Outsourcing LLC. Reyes-Santos and Lara continued to review translations for accuracy before anything was made available on the site.</p>
<p>The careful curation of shared knowledge was a major task for the research team, selecting what was appropriate to be shared openly and online and what was for the healer community alone. The choice of open or closed access remains with the community; these collections did not become part of the Libraries’ collections, nor are the healer interviews available to be downloaded through Panopto. One area that this was particularly acute was in the creation of the digital map and the latitude and longitude associated with the photographs of plants taken in association with a planned ethnobotanical dictionary. That metadata was removed using EXIF Tool and Adobe Bridge and for the map, abstracted to a more general location, with the story shared on the map talking about history and methodology, rather than the specificity of the location or the research site where the photograph was taken. This honored some of the healers’ requests to protect them from ongoing ostracization in their communities.</p>
<p>What is shared, though, is meant to be shared with the largest possible audience. A running thread throughout the process was the emphasis on accessibility, navigation, content display and ability to view the content through multiple kinds of devices and networks. Given that the majority of healers in the project live in rural communities outside the U.S., and that they access the internet through phones on 3G networks, we wanted to ensure that the website is equitable, flexible, and intuitive for user and interactivity; have information be perceived in multiple ways regardless of sensory ability; and have the site be responsive to different screen sizes dependent on the types of technical devices used to access it. By applying accessibility concepts throughout the digital technology selection and digital content process, the builders understood requirements for a sitemap, inspirations for look and feel, and different ways to represent and engage with interviews. For example, transcriptions and translations were made separately available to download on healer pages. These PDFs, which are speech-to-text reader-friendly, are read aloud by the computer.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-and-sustainability">Open Source and Sustainability</h2>
<p>Given the principles of openness informing <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> and many (if not most) digital humanities projects, it might be expected that open-source software solutions were selected for philosophical reasons rather than for desirable design or special features. This is not to say that open source cannot be beautiful, usable, or functional (or all three) — that would be absurd. However, in many years of development experience, the staff of DSS discovered the custom open-source digital projects they co-created with faculty at the University of Oregon typically had a limited lifespan as teaching or research tools. Whether an individual left the university, or a major database system or programming language was deprecated, after a few years, the project was frequently in dire straits, with security and accessibility issues requiring significant intervention.</p>
<p>We can and should approach digital projects with a clear understanding of their limited lifespan, engaging in appropriate digital stewardship activities to ensure the underlying digital collections are maintained. Beyond those collections, however, the builders sought a greater level of sustainability for <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> by using platforms with broad institutional support. Not only is WordPress the most-used web content management system in the world, but the University of Oregon has a multi-site license agreement with the educational technology company, CampusPress to provide access to WordPress to all faculty, staff, and students. There is a depth of WordPress expertise in the Libraries and in central campus Information Services, as well as access to vendor support should more extensive troubleshooting be required. Through CampusPress, we have access to the premium WordPress theme Divi, which we used for <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> and enabled the builders to closely implement the culturally responsive design vision developed by the research team.</p>
<p>In selecting a digital mapping tool, we opted for the familiar open-source option, Northwestern University’s Knight Lab-sponsored StoryMapJS, rather than ESRI’s recently updated Story Map product. Either would have worked for our needs, abstracting from a specific location to protect healers’ privacy and showcasing Reyes-Santos&rsquo; and Lara’s images and writings from their research sites. Each story on the map focuses on the spiritual histories of enslaved and colonized Indigenous communities of that location. Given the builders’ collective experience with StoryMapJS, we were disinclined to add a new platform to our oeuvre for the sake of it or because it was new. In the time since <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> ’ launch, Thornhill and Gaede have gained a great deal of experience with ESRI Story Maps and the same institutional support factors that has encouraged our use of WordPress may yet see us switching platforms for digital mapping.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the lifespan of <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> is a combination of technical and methodological choice. We selected platforms based on institutional environments and what we thought would give the project the most longevity. UO Libraries’ Special Collections and University Archives will not taking custody of the digital collections created as part of this project; everything remains with the researchers as surrogates and members of the communities from which they were collected, settling questions of post-custodial disposition. If any healer wishes their interviews or materials to be removed, both the formal research protocol and their personal agreements with the researchers dictate prompt removal. That right to be forgotten is absolute<a class="footnote-ref" href="#christen2015"> [christen2015] </a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h2 id="successes">Successes</h2>
<p><em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> enables the dissemination and continuity of Afro-Indigenous healers’ knowledge and values in a format that is open access and built to last. Together, a diverse and collaborative team of healers, faculty, librarians, students, and technology specialists produced a DH project that centers the decolonial values of the research throughout the digital scholarship process. This project disrupts the use of unsustainable technical infrastructures and information dissemination, has a research output beyond the boundaries of academia, breaks down disciplinary silos, and redefines relationships between teaching and research<a class="footnote-ref" href="#moritz2017"> [moritz2017] </a>. As a project informed by Black feminist praxis, it pays particular attention to the locations of knowledge production, while aiming to maintain multiplicity and plurality. As stated by Nicole M. Brown et al., “black feminism offers interventions that serve to dismantle embedded privilege and reification and (digitally) center the experiences of Black women within digital humanities research.”</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Team communication can be challenging across disciplines. The disciplinary vocabulary and jargon, particularly that associated with the digital work, could create barriers between researchers and builders. Similarly, researchers had to find language to explain project stages to healers. Ongoing communication and mutual openness to questions was key and created opportunities to learn and share new words, meanings, and theories that are part of expertise in ethnography, black feminist praxis, decolonial methodologies, ethnobotany, web development, and information science. An example of this communication challenge are definitions and applications of metadata that are required for images, interviews, and other materials cataloging.</p>
<p><em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> was first presented in English, requiring additional resources for future development and presentation in Spanish – the primary language of those centered by the project. We kept all interviews in their original languages so healers could hear themselves and share with others their interviews as they were done. And yet we could not escape the demands of the imperial academy to produce knowledge in English as the only legitimate knowledge<a class="footnote-ref" href="#curtisboles2012"> [curtisboles2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#mohanty2006"> [mohanty2006] </a>. The resources are in the U.S. and finding digital teams with the kinds of resources and capacity that the UO Libraries provided within the Caribbean is difficult at best. These dynamics replicate some of the inherent issues of the digital humanities, whereby the United States continues to predominate as a site for the production of digital scholarship<a class="footnote-ref" href="#risam2016"> [risam2016] </a>. It is a dynamic that feels inescapable given that both researchers live and work within the U.S. academy. In the meantime, we are aware that academic systems of evaluation for tenure and promotion may implicitly erase the labor that healers engaged in giving input, feedback, and changing and transforming knowledge within the overall process.</p>
<h2 id="just-futures">Just Futures</h2>
<p>The Pacific Northwest Just Futures Institute for Racial and Climate Justice was founded in early 2021 with a generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and is sponsoring the next stage of <em>Caribbean Women Healers, Sustaining Climate Justice and Health through Afro-Indigenous Healing</em> . With Mellon funding, Reyes-Santos and Lara will continue their work to incorporate storytelling and healing practices in conversations about TEK with support from the UO Libraries team, including Thornhill, Gaede, and Malinao-Alvarez. Thornhill, Gaede, and Malinao-Alvarez team will initially work on building the Spanish mirror site, with content created by Lara.</p>
<p>Reyes-Santos and Lara will work with Indigenous, Afro-Indigenous, and Black communities in the Pacific Northwest to document and disseminate how these healers deploy TEK to support communities disproportionately impacted by climate change, its attendant environmental disasters, and the pandemic; foster and document TEK exchanges between growing migrant Afro-Indigenous communities and local Native and African American communities; train students to engage in related climate and racial-justice research; and recruit students of color and working-class students as research interns. Work will include edited audio/video interviews, ethnobotanical surveys, and pedagogical resources, in collaboration with students of color, migrant students, and first-generation students.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>Reyes and Lara, both Black-Indigenous women, placed the desires, visions and values of their communities at the center of their collaboration with the UO Libraries. With or without technology, Afro-Indigenous healers in the Caribbean continue to live their lives, working for a present and future in which Black life can be sustained across the generations. And, as the healers told us, this project enables the transmission of knowledge in ways that circumvent the impacts of social violence, rapid emigration and ongoing social stigma.</p>
<p>We do expect that while facing these challenges and lessons, <em>Caribbean Women Healers</em> will intervene in the future of Black Studies, a future that engages the heterogeneity and inter-ethnic realities of the Black Diaspora; continues to forge transcolonial, transnational, multilingual connections between Black peoples and histories; engages Afro-Indigeneity, women and queer people seriously; bravely interweaves histories of genocide and slavery, and of Indigenous and Black resistance; centers decolonial knowledge production and orality; fosters collaborative, interdisciplinary, self-transformative scholarship that destabilize the assumptions of both Black Studies and DH; and employs Black DH tools to create sound open-access scholarship, teaching tools, and creative possibilities for academia to engage general audiences.</p>

<p>We conceptualized and proposed this issue shortly after the 2018 <em>Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black</em> conference held by<a href="https://aadhum.umd.edu/asante/about/">University of Maryland’s Center for African American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities</a>(AADHum), co-organized by Catherine Knight Steele and Trevor Muñoz. One of the core challenges expressed by scholars was the limited legibility of their work in DH, a field that is predominantly white. Their work was often categorized as outside of DH, borrowing DH tools and applied them to other self-contained fields. Scholars noted how this impacted their ability to secure academic jobs, get published, or even be granted tenure. There are tangible and serious consequences to not recognizing the work of Black scholars as well as not validating methodologies and projects that center Black subjects in DH.</p>
<p>Over the past four years digital humanities scholars have committed to antiracism and feminism, calling for a more equitable field/ Black Digital Humanities has blossomed. Black DH scholars who have helped shape the field — such as Catherine Knight Steele, André Brock, and Moya Bailey — have published books with NYU, MIT, and other well-established presses. There has also been a rise in Black DH and media studies positions.</p>
<p>However, we must still work to center Black digital humanists and scholars; this work is ongoing and necessary, especially in the face of anti-Black violence in academia and digital spaces. We also recognize that there are inequities within Black DH projects, and limited funding also means limited opportunity. Even with a stream of new lines of hire, the academic job market remains unstable. Coupled with issues of retention and the abuses and exploitations faced by Black scholars, even those that can finally be put into productive positions find themselves pushed to the margins of academia. Precarity is rife, but each day we marvel at how these scholars resist and center themselves and their colleagues. We imagine this special issue as a hub of that resistance. In a fight against white-supremacy, sexism, and ableism, we stand with other scholars of Black DH and we work towards a more equitable world.</p>
<p>The past four years have changed beyond just the scope of Black DH. We knew that undertaking a project like this would be major — it is nearly four years in the making. Building a special issue takes time even in perfect conditions. We and the writers of this issue saw cataclysmic shifts — the Covid-19 pandemic, racial reckonings, volatile presidencies, and the Russian-Ukrainan war. Much has changed. It is no surprise that despite the pandemic&rsquo;s hinderings and the overall global conflicts and violence, Black people have been able to organize, work, and bond. Our authors wrote mostly before and in the midst of these events, and may not have been able to fully or directly attend to this in their work. We ask that you read these in good faith, and know that the omission was not intentional. Instead we ask that you read the articles and think about how they might help yourself and others better understand the contemporary moment. Reading the articles and metareflections published in this special issue at this time should urge you to think in new ways about how Black DH projects can be revelatory of larger issues. For example, Bryan M. Jenkin&rsquo;s and Taryn K. Myers’ work on Black Podcasts is helpful in explaining why centering Black voices and opinions is critical to understanding our current political climate. Dr. Ravynn K. Stringfield’s work on Black women’s social networks exposes how they build community and support one another in the face of adversity– building a framework for how we might <em>all</em> work together to uplift each other.</p>
<p>The relative youth of Black DH as a field has allowed it to be born radical. While some fields have more conservative traditions that they must break free from, Black DH has been able to forage a more inclusive path.</p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>In this special issue — from the original brainstorming to the final publication — we committed to Black digital humanities and larger Black feminist methodologies and practices for collaboration. Because this SI is specifically focused on the future of Black DH, which meant specifically inviting early-career scholars to publish, we committed to demystifying the publication process and disciplinary knowledges, pushing against the opaque writing and reviewing process that often manufactures barriers for graduate students, especially Black graduate students.</p>
<p>For us, citational politics have been critical in how we think and practice our scholarship. Taking cues from scholars like Jessica Marie Johnson, Moya Bailey, and André Brock, we always cite where we can (and not just when necessary) and we take joy in building up scholarship and creating networks of thought. As we note below, we also encourage our writers to do the same.</p>
<p>Recently, several scholars came together to compile “<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lZmZqeNNnYfYgmTKSbL2ijYbR4OMovv6A-bDwJRnwx8/edit">Anti-Racist Scholarly Reviewing Practices: A Heuristic for Editors, Reviewers, and Authors</a>,” a set of anti-racist scholarly reviewing practices with specific steps editors, reviewers, and authors can implement into their everyday work. The goal of this document is to invite inclusive and equitable practices, rather than reproducing gatekeeping. Even though this document was not available during our reviewing process, we implemented several of these practices as they align with our own methodologies and commitments. We encourage editors, reviewers, and authors in digital humanities to take seriously these anti-racist practices. In our commitment to this anti-racist process that centers Black knowledges, experiences, and methodologies, we use this space to explain our own editorial process — a process we hope others take on, whether invested in Black DH, anti-racism, or changing academia.</p>
<h2 id="transparent-submission--proposal-process">Transparent Submission &amp; Proposal Process</h2>
<p>When we proposed the special issue, we chose a workflow that allowed for scholars, especially early career scholars, to learn about the peer review and publication process. The call for proposals invited scholars to submit a short description of their planned article; this meant less work up front for potential authors. In the<a href="http://bit.ly/between-DH-and-me-CFP">original call for proposals</a>, we also invited interested scholars to join proposal workshops.</p>
<h2 id="workshopping--writing-sessions">Workshopping &amp; Writing Sessions</h2>
<p>The first workshop, which we held twice, centered around attendees drafting their proposals and asking us questions. In this workshop we described the proposal process, shared the criteria we were planning to use to evaluate the proposals, provided a longer description of the publication process, and answered any questions from attendees. Most of the attendees submitted proposals. The<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1btcC63F1JZuHbZDcyiTo_e_8xkk5vuq6FfSD85kkh-E/edit?usp=sharing"> “Workshop for Proposals” handout</a>is available for further reading.</p>
<p>Once proposals were accepted, we also hosted a series of writing sessions before the contributors submitted their articles to be peer reviewed. These writing sessions allowed contributors to carve out time to write, ask us questions, and continue to learn about the peer review and special issue process. During these workshops and writing sessions, we had a chance to build community with the authors, learning not only about their articles but their values, goals, and overall research.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-on-drafts">Feedback on Drafts</h2>
<p>Before the contributors sent their proposals in for peer review, we also provided a round of feedback. We hoped not only to continue fostering the community we built through the workshops and writing sessions, but also wanted to play a part in ensuring articles would receive the most productive, careful, and thoughtful feedback. We read through each article and provided feedback in regards to citational politics, organization, the development of important ideas, and ethical research practices. We pointed to Moya Bailey’s “#transform(ing)DH Writing and Research: An Autoethnography of Digital Humanities and Feminist Ethics” as a guide for ethical, feminist online research<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2015"> [bailey2015] </a>.</p>
<h2 id="recognizing-labor-and-limitations">Recognizing Labor and Limitations</h2>
<p>Composing a special issue, writing articles and metareflections, peer reviewing, and editing all take an enormous amount of mostly uncompensated labor. This uncompensated labor, though, scratches the surface for what the past four years has brought upon Black academics and Black communities. First, COVID-19 has devestated Black and Latinx communities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#oppel2020"> [oppel2020] </a>. Even the CDC’s lack of transparency with surveillance data demonstrates how data collection can continuously harm Black people or hide the violence Black people face, as Angel David Nieves addresses in his metareflection. Second, the state-sactioned murders of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd led to the demand from institutions for Black scholars, practitioners, writers, and workers to address anti-Blackness. Suddenly, the expected labor for Black academics doubled and tripled, often with no offers for compensation. Because of this, we were constantly communicating with the article and metareflection authors, offering flexible deadlines, space to ask questions, and words of encouragement. This special issue is the product of an immense amount of labor, from the editors to the reviewers to the authors.</p>
<h2 id="organization-of-this-special-issue">Organization of this Special Issue</h2>
<p>When we first envisioned the make up of this issue we knew that we wanted to highlight our brilliant peers and that we wanted to give our readers a sense of what was to come in Black Digital Humanities. While highlighting the work of brilliant scholars such as Ravynn K. Stringfield, Romi Ron Morrison, and Brienne A. Adams among others, we also realized that their work rested on the scholarship of a previous generation of scholars that blazed the trials that they walked across. In order to acknowledge this we have enlisted several advanced scholars, including Moya Bailey, Kim Gallon, and Kaiama L. Glover to write <em>metareflections</em> . These short essays gave them the space to meditate and reflect on their own work and the larger DH field. They also allow for the scholars to imagine its future as well as the concerns and optimism they have for the future of Black Digital Humanities.</p>
<p>The digital humanities often evades containment to a single genre. Whether it be a web only project, digital dissertation, or the building of a digital archive or respiratory, it is nearly impossible to set a rigid guideline to how each project should be composed. We gave our writers free reign to write whatever they wanted, however they wanted to compose their work. Some of our articles take on a standard journal article frame, while others are insights into digital archives or podcasts, some are intended to be used as pedagogical tools, and others offer outline methodologies for others to take up in their work. The unique format of each article puts into practice the exact sort of thinking that the creator implores for its readers.</p>
<p>Although the genres are distinct, they coalesce together under shared themes — the importance of recovering, recording, and preserving historical data and objects; recognizing spaces for uplift and joy; and spotlighting the brilliance of Black folks and their extensive contributions to technology. These themes themselves are all interconnected. The collection of objects and data assure that Black people&rsquo;s contributions to technology (and beyond) are minted, and there is a certain level of joy and community that is built around that work — a great example of this are the scholars behind the<a href="https://coloredconventions.org/about/">Colored Conventions Project</a>. As editors, we brought these pieces together in hopes that our readers would show the multitudes of Black DH scholarship, while also learning more about what brings them together, and what forms the tenets of the field.</p>
<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
<p>This special issue emphasizes how Black scholars, Black content creators, and allies of Black scholars and content creators are always-already using digital technologies and tools in innovative, feminist, humanstic, and activist ways. As Catherine Knight Steele emphasizes in her introduction to her exciting 2022 book <em>Digital Black Feminism</em> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black women online [are] purveyors of digital skill and expertise, not deficient or in need to new skills to survive…Black women without extensive programming experience have maximized platform affordances, built transmedia platforms, led platform migrations, pushed platform policy changes regarding hate speech and content moderation, and introduced us to new pay structures as precursors to influencer culture<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#steele2021"> [steele2021] </a>.<br>
Steele’s celebration of Black women is reflected throughout several of the contributors’ articles and reflections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article contributors to this issue demonstrate both their own innovative approaches to digital spaces. Franny Gaede, Ana-Maurine Lara, Alaí Reyes-Santos, and Kate Thornhill apply decolonial methodologies in creating a digital archive of Afro-Indigenous women healers in the Caribbean, centering cultural awareness in all aspects of the project. Similarly, Jazma Sutton and Kalani Craig incorporate “descendant archival practice” in the building and analysis of <em>Remembering Freedom History Harvest</em> , a digital archive that “relies&hellip;on the community archives and memory work that join together in descendant archival practice as a way to generate Black women’s histories” . Finally, Ravynn K Stringfield examines the labors of joy for Black women graduate students sharing their experiences online, which include her own labors on her blog <em>Black Girl Does Grad School (BGDGS)</em> ; she reminds us that there are communities and networks that will never fail us, even in the face of abject political adversity.</p>
<p>The contributors also analyze the approaches of Black people and communities in digital spaces in innovative ways. For instance, Brienne Adams analyzes intimacy in affirmative transformative fan practices in the the <em>Awkward Black Girl</em> and <em>Insecure</em> Black digital fandoms. Bryan Jenkins and Taryn Myers conduct a rich qualitative coding analysis of Black podcasts, centering their analysis on how these podcasts integrate and build community, resistance, and voice. Finally, Romi Ron Morrison’s “Voluptous Disintergration” helps us better understand Black life and its relationship to technology and revolutionary politics. Their theorization of Black Computational Thought highlights the “quotidian, social, opaque, woven, and fugitive practices of computation born from Black diasporic movement” , giving us further insight into how Black people have always already been on the cutting edge of both technology and culture.</p>
<h2 id="metareflections">Metareflections</h2>
<p>Across the metaflections we hope you notice the incredible strides the field has made, and can see more plainly the ways in which these scholars have made and influenced the field. But we also want to note how they are not just brilliant scholars that have created works that are thoroughly cited throughout, they are have also acted as mentors, as interlocutors, and as champions of this rising generation — proving that they are not just brilliant, but that they are nurturing and supportive and that they believe in this generation, a generosity that is unparalleled. As you read them, we hope that it inspires you to return to and take a deeper look into their work, as that will bring further clarity of purpose as you dive into the work of this rising generation that builds from them.</p>
<p>Moya Bailey reflects on her journey as a central Black DH scholar and looks forward; she reflects on how Black DH and other online spaces can provide ample opportunity for connection and research towards social justice, but expresses concern with DH’s continued obsession with coding. Still, she finds hope in the expanding diversity — both identity and theoretical diversity — of the field. Like Bailey, Roopika Risam reflects on her early years in DH, which led her and like-minded colleagues to create coalitions to build a more justice-centered and ethnicity-focused DH. She had not initially set out to do DH work, but like many of us, she found that DH was a place that was ripe for exploring new possibilities, possibilities that offered even more opportunities to work towards social justice than more traditional frameworks and methods of study.</p>
<p>Angel David Nieves gives practical advice on how we can work towards expanding the diversity of the field. He offers ten specific practices that can do just that. They include “harness[ing] the breadth of digital expertise, in Black social media, and Black software and hardware design while developing new forms of digital scholarship” and supporting information systems practitioners who are advancing Black DH projects. From an information systems practitioner perspective, Bethany Nowviskie argues for the need to create archives, collections and libraries that center generative and healing infrastructure, rather than control. Elizabeth Losh focuses on concerns about funding, labor, and equity, and encourages more localized organizing to better support Black DH, Black graduate students, and graduate students of color; she points to the <em>Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black</em> conference as an example. These scholars point us towards concrete ways that we can assure that the field of Black DH, and even DH more broadly, has better practices and more inclusive ways of organizing within the field. In Kim Gallon’s metareflection, she urges us to not just look to Black DH as a site of resistance and liberation, but to also look at the places where the joy and pleasure of Black life can be found. We see Gallon’s call as necessary. It is this hope and joy that sustains the optimism we run on to drive the future in a better direction. We hope that you find moments of pleasure tucked all throughout this issue, and we hope that they nourish you.</p>
<p>The other metareflection writers look back to their own theoretical groundwork in DH, and their own impetus for driving the field. Kaiama L. Glover remarks on how DH has the ability to provide new space and platforms for all sorts of thinking and projects. Like many, she believes in the “affordances of the digital” for collaboration and work towards equity. But, in order to do this, she urges us to avoid replicating the practice of focusing solely on the US, and push the boundaries further to be more inclusive of all Black people, and create more space and opportunity for research by and about people from Caribbean and Black people across the global diaspora. Avoiding a focus solely on the US helps us move away from overdetermining American subjects and overlooking others. This resonates with Louis Maraj’s plea that we avoid canonizing or constricting Black DH with too much definition. Instead, we should focus on the multiplicity of Black DH and Black lives. He notes “Nah, I believe that virality inherently offers — through distribution — constant space for mashing up contexts, artifacts, identities, and the very frameworks on which settler-colonial, racial capitalist projects lie” . As Maraj argues – and as all the metareflection authors demonstrate – Black Digital Humanities scholars, practices, and theories resist full and complete definitions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope Black DH continues to evade definition. Practically, it calls in all types of folks who do all types of work, whether the emphasis lies in the digital or in the humanities. It also allows scholars to create an individual sense of the field to fit their own needs. More than thirty years into its earliest conceptions of the field, in 2014 the website “<a href="https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/">What is Digital Humanities</a>” randomized more than 800 DH scholar’s running definitions of the field showing the wide breadth of definitions.</p>
<p>The focus of Black DH and this special issue is not to define Black DH, but rather spotlight the limitless, interdisciplinary nature of Black DH and Black scholarship. Both article and metareflection authors alike build upon lineages of Black studies, feminist, queer, and womanist scholars, forging new paths using their innovative methodologies as they examine, construct, and reimagine innovative communities and people. We hope this special issue contributes to the expanding field as well as Black DH scholars, DH scholars, and graduate students committed to Black studies and centering Black lives to take up this work.</p>

Glover</name></author><published>2022-07-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-04T13:14:15-04:00</updated><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Consistent with my recent reflections on the work – the material labor – of<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctv1kchp41.22?seq=1">dreaming in digital</a>,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I want to focus here on possibility. Like many before me, I began working at the intersection of the humanities and technology from a place of optimistic anticipation. The phrase “the affordances of the digital” tripped lightly over my tongue and the opportunities for differently ordering – for expanding – my intellectual world at first appeared endless. But then, of course (and also like many before me), I quickly came to recognize the perils of wading naively into the waters of DH, the relative ease with which the very hierarchies and exclusions that have long underpinned analog scholarship are reiterated in the digital realm.</p>
<p>As a researcher in the field of Caribbean studies with particular grounding in francophone literature and culture, my forays into the digital have been largely site-specific. They reflect, accompany, and emerge from the preoccupations that inform my traditional research and teaching – the monographs and articles I have published, the courses I have designed over the last two decades. I have been committed to the persistent unsettling of centers and margins – those that determine the parameters of belonging within the academy as the principal site of knowledge production and circulation, and those that make or deny space along explicitly and implicitly racialized lines. While thinking within this frame has meant contesting the university’s foundational Eurocentricity, I have in fact been most interested in querying the forms of intramural border-drawing that persist within the field of Black studies – notably, the tendency to position of US-American blackness as stand-in for the global Black experience, and the not-unrelated phenomenon of Anglophone monolinguality.</p>
<p>Thus, when I think about ideal futures for Black studies and the digital humanities, and about the ways I might contribute to crafting those futures, I think primarily from the space of the Afro-Americas. This is certainly not to suggest that shifting focus from the US-American space to the Caribbean archipelago would on its own constitute an ideal. Rather, it is to express my hope that thinking the Caribbean idiosyncratically in my digital work can contribute to widening and nuancing understandings of “blackness” in the hemispheric Americas and beyond. This has entailed relying on Caribbean epistemologies to build digital products: that is, keeping front of mind Martinican writer-intellectual Edouard Glissant’s interconnected term-conceptsopacity,relation,andrhizomatic thinking; Jamaican writer-intellectual Sylvia Wynter’s call to embrace oppositional forms of life – plots that challenge the plantation order; and Barbadian writer-intellectual Kamau Brathwaite&rsquo;s very notion of the archipelago as space of “submarine unity” – among other modes of thinking community in the shadow of empire, of naming and interrogating phenotypical and class diversity among racialized beings.</p>
<p>It has also meant working to develop the mechanisms we need as Caribbeanists in order to be in conversation despite the linguistic and disciplinary silos that in many ways constrain Black participation in the academy. It has meant exploiting the “shine” of DH to direct resources and to accord deserved prestige to colleagues and communities that are crucial to but rarely enjoy the privileges of the work being done in North Atlantic institutions.</p>
<p>My efforts to address these concerns – to make resourcesreachinto Caribbean spaces – are reflected in the various initiatives my collaborators and I have worked to build, sustain, and grow in the last decades.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Leveraging, yes, the affordances of the digital, we have created platforms for both collaboration and accreditation among Caribbeanist DHers: an annual hybrid international conference devoted to collectively examining and amplifying digital Caribbean theory and praxis; an online peer-reviewed journal that showcases the extraordinary work produced within this community of scholars and practitioners of the digital; and a set of mapping visualizations designed to facilitate understandings of the Caribbean within a global frame, among else.</p>
<p>The annual conference,<a href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2021/">The Caribbean Digital</a>,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> is an international event hosted annually at locations in the United States and the Caribbean since 2014. This event has created a singular and consistent space of exchange for Caribbeanist digital scholars, consisting of traditional panels, roundtable conversations, skills-building workshops, and project show-and-tells. The work done in preparation for this gathering and/or produced in its wake has led to the publication of more than 30 peer-reviewed scholarly articles and digital projects as well as to the development of several ongoing digital artifacts, including a collectively generated<a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/1914/20151224034325/http://caribbeandigital.cdrs.columbia.edu/?page_id=113">bibliography</a>, a collective<a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://cahier1939ms.github.io/texts/translation/">translation</a>, a<a href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2020/keywords/">keyword</a>project, and a<a href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2020/directory/">directory</a>of Caribbeanist digital projects.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="https://archipelagosjournal.org/"> <em>archipelagos journal</em> </a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> is a born-digital, peer-reviewed publication created in 2016 to “discern the ways in which the digital may enhance and transform our comprehension of the regional and diasporic Caribbean.” We created this platform both as a space for theorists and practitioners of the Caribbean digital to produce and share knowledge, and as a peer-review model that ensures the recognition and reward of this scholarship by the profession. Fully open access and infrastructurally lightweight, the journal was designed with sustainability of all sorts in mind.</p>
<p>Our most recent project, the cartographic digital visualization<a href="http://sameboats.org"> <em>In the Same Boats</em> </a>,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> takes up the challenge of scholarly communication across the nation-language borders that are the legacies of European empire. It offers a series of individual maps built on a common template to produce a synthesizing illustration of the connections undergirding Black knowledge production from the twentieth century to the present. <em>Same Boats</em> lowers the barrier to entry for “digi-curious” Caribbeanists and other scholars of the African diaspora; to participate in this digital (ad)venture requires only the ability to enter data into a spreadsheet. Moreover, and as with all of our projects, it is open access and the back-end is transparent, its code on offer to any who would ask.</p>
<p>I think of these platforms as so many invitations extended to a widely dispersed and unevenly resourced Caribbeanist intellectual community. They are meant to provide sites of exchange less bound by the logistical, bureaucratic, and financial demands of physical displacement. All of these projects have made use where possible of minimal computing, so to be maximally accessible to communities of scholars working outside of well-resourced institutions or in contexts where infrastructural support (electricity, stable internet service) is less reliable. All of them have welcomed contributions from all the languages of the Caribbean. Most recently, we have sought and been awarded significant<a href="https://barnard.edu/news/barnard-college-receives-5m-grant-andrew-w-mellon-foundation">funding</a><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> , making it possible not only for us to subsidize costs for community members seeking to participate in events involving travel, and to provide translation for our published content and interpretation for our in-person gathering, but also to directly distribute resources through sub-awards to Caribbean institutions and a micro-granting program.</p>
<p>There are, of course, aspects of our Caribbean digital futures that are still hindered by contemporary imperialist realities. The United States remains the magnetic center of the Americas. As such, even the most progressive scholarly pursuits – be they digital or analog – are conditioned by a North Atlantic frame that tends to think blackness, linguistically, in English and, culturally, as a minority identity. If we shift the frame south into the Caribbean and Latin America, however, vastly different expressions and experiences of blackness become legible. Our challenge as Caribbeanist digital scholars is to continue pushing toward that decentered frame in Black studies, to use technology as a means of substantively collaborating and sharing resources with colleagues situated outside of the U.S., and to advocate for multilinguality and translation. Only in so doing can we hope to create Afro-diasporic systems of knowledge production in the digital humanities that reflect inclusively humanist interests and values, highlight diverse contributions, and nourish the widest range of dreams.</p>

<p>This study builds on the work of scholars – most notably, Dr. Sarah Florini and Dr. Catherine Knight Steele — who critically examine Black voices in digital spaces in order to understand how both networked and independent Black podcasts, a successor of Black radio, shape discourse around a range of issues and events salient to the Black diaspora. Berry describes podcasts as a “horizontal media form…producers are consumers, consumers may become producers, and both can engage in conversations with each other”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#berry2006"> [berry2006] </a>. Berry argues that podcasts are not merely a converged medium which incorporates audio, web, and portable media devices, but podcasts are also a disruptive technology displacing established assumptions about audience consumption and media production and distribution.</p>
<p>Using Black public sphere as an analytical tool, this study explores how podcasting contributes to the Black digital public sphere by answering questions related to how Black podcasters build community, perpetuate resistance, and contribute to Black critical debate. The Black Public Sphere is a significant analytical framework used to identify varying political positions and interrogate Black voices in digital spaces because it is a critical site where democratic discourse takes place and emerging diasporic social movements are envisioned<a class="footnote-ref" href="#blackpub1995"> [blackpub1995] </a>. Black podcasts symbolize a digital space “in which intellectuals join with the energies of the street, the school, the church, and the city to constitute a challenge to the exclusionary violence of much public space in the United States”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#blackpub1995"> [blackpub1995] </a>. Analyzing podcasting as a critical media technology that fosters democratic debate creates an opportunity to observe the importance of Black podcasts to the field of digital humanities.</p>
<p>Why is podcasting a critical medium? Podcasting is significant to Black content creators because it is a relatively cost-effective, user-generated medium with far reaching implications for education, information gathering, and community building, especially around topics that are salient to Black communities across the diaspora. Podcasts also serve as a critical archive for digital humanists because podcasts have the potential to become primary source documentation that centers the experiences and voices of a range of Black people – Black podcasters are collectively memorializing significant moments in Black culture. Historically, Black media have always been crucial for memorializing and publicizing the Black experience in America – Black print news, Black magazines, Black radio, and Black television have been critical in anchoring and fostering support for a range of social justice movements and for telling stories where Black people and their lives are centered<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bacon2003"> [bacon2003] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#danky2009"> [danky2009] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fraser2016"> [fraser2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#payton2012"> [payton2012] </a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this research is to demonstrate the significance of Black podcasting to both the Black diaspora and the digital humanities field. Attempting to narrowly define what denotes a Black podcast, and therefore Blackness, could prove to essentialize a vast and diverse group of people. In an effort not to do so, this study only seeks to define what was deemed as a Black podcast for the purposes of this research as opposed to providing a definitive definition for Black podcasts. For this study, a Black podcast is one that features a Black host or majority of Black hosts and centers Black people in the content it produces. Black podcasts have the potential to disrupt the ways in which mainstream media set the agenda for the salience of political topics.</p>
<p>This study places Black podcasting within the context of more traditional forms of Black media. This literature will reveal that key to Black media are themes of community-building, resistance, and voice. The analysis conducted on the podcasts included in this study identified topics prevalent across the podcasts that indicate the different ways in which these podcasts express the aforementioned themes, adding to the legacy of Black media in their own unique ways.</p>
<h2 id="black-media-and-representation">Black Media and Representation</h2>
<p>In hegemonic societies, the dominant group’s privilege also includes the advantage of controlling the presentation and dissemination of information<a class="footnote-ref" href="#squires2002"> [squires2002] </a>. Although access to public arenas is technically guaranteed to all, “all will not necessarily be equal within those spaces” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#squires2002"> [squires2002] </a>. Unfortunately, groups oppressed by gender, race, ethnicity, sexual identity, disability, and class are not able to enjoy the same access to media resources, and their views and voices are not given the same legitimacy and presence in discursive activities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#squires2002"> [squires2002] </a>. More specifically, the oppression of Black people created an economic disparity and historically, this has impacted Black people’s access to the necessary capital needed to create and maintain their own media<a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson1993"> [johnson1993] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#selmanearnest1985"> [selmanearnest1985] </a>. Squires supports the need for marginalized groups to have separate spaces to discuss the specific interests of the cultural in-group without intrusion of the dominant group<a class="footnote-ref" href="#squires2002"> [squires2002] </a>.</p>
<p>Though mainstream media are instrumental in communicating ideas, news, and the prevailing viewpoint, it has not been as dedicated to providing nuanced analyses of the issues related to marginalized groups. For marginalized groups, alternative media spaces are part of a historical tradition that has been important to counterbalancing the overwhelming silencing of Black voices and life experiences in traditional media formats<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wilson2013"> [wilson2013] </a>. The cultural impact of Black mediated spaces, spaces that are occupied and organized by Black people and support Black centered discourse, draws its historical connection to <em>Freedom’s Journal</em> , the first Black newspaper developed in 1827 in New York City<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bacon2003"> [bacon2003] </a>. According to Bacon, this publication was created as a means to amplify a wider range of Black voices within public discourse about the positioning and future of Black people, not only in the United States, but also around the world. The <em>Freedom Journal</em> proved to be an important space for Black content creators to publicize the plight of Black people globally and encourage radical, emancipatory movements<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bacon2003"> [bacon2003] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fraser2016"> [fraser2016] </a>. This set the stage for Black people to envision themselves as members of a larger intra-racial community, which would later be solidified through technological advances that resulted in Black radio and Black entertainment television.</p>
<p>Black radio, like its press predecessor, provided a space for Black people to participate in discourse about their experiences with oppression, and it created a means for community building around a shared desire to mitigate their marginalization. Black radio proved to be integral during the Civil Rights Movement as it was a space where Black people were able to discuss their discrimination, and sometimes through coded messaging, Black broadcasters were able to communicate meeting locations for political demonstrations to their audience<a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson1993"> [johnson1993] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#williams2005"> [williams2005] </a>. Beyond the Civil Rights era, Black radio continued to exist as a space to discuss issues pertaining to Black communities as well as organize and promote various community events such as panel discussions, debates and protests held within Black communities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#squires2002"> [squires2002] </a>.</p>
<p>Black television stations and programs, while not as abundant as press and radio largely due to financial constraints, also proved to serve a similar purpose<a class="footnote-ref" href="#selmanearnest1985"> [selmanearnest1985] </a>. Black TV provided platforms to hold discourse on race relations and issues within Black communities. There was an emphasis advocating for the Black communities they served and promoting various initiatives intended to empower these communities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#blevins2019"> [blevins2019] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#heitner2013"> [heitner2013] </a>.</p>
<p>This suggests that Black media is critical for dismantling the privileging of dominant groups in mainstream media, and this is what makes Black podcasting a critical medium. Compared to radio<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> , an antecedent of the podcast, podcast listening is typically very intense and interactive<a class="footnote-ref" href="#newman2019"> [newman2019] </a>. Podcasts are participatory culture in that podcast hosts and listeners actively engage in sharing ideas and knowledge with one another<a class="footnote-ref" href="#yee2019"> [yee2019] </a>. There is radical potential for Black podcasts to be the idealized communication space of the Black diaspora – a space meant for democratic debate to contest the marginalization of Black people globally and share visionary political ideas that have emancipatory potential<a class="footnote-ref" href="#blackpub1995"> [blackpub1995] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2015"> [florini2015] </a>. In this context, Black public sphere is an ideal analytical tool in which to guide the examination of Black podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="the-black-public-sphere">The Black Public Sphere</h2>
<p>Theorist Jürgen Habermas argues that in the late 18th and 19th centuries, people gathered in what he coined as public spheres, or places frequented by the bourgeois (pubs, restaurants, opera halls, etc.) to debate and come to a consensus about political issues of the day<a class="footnote-ref" href="#calhoun1992"> [calhoun1992] </a>. According to Fraser, the concept of the bourgeois public sphere is important to the development of theory because it is a place designed to be critical of the dominant, controlling group<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fraser1992"> [fraser1992] </a>. However, Habermas’ original work did not account for the varied voices within society<a class="footnote-ref" href="#squires2002"> [squires2002] </a>. Though Habermas did attempt to rearticulate his original concept and eventually posed the idea of multiple public spheres, he fell short of examining other “nonliberal, nonbourgeois, competing public spheres”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fraser1992"> [fraser1992] </a>. To address this gap, a group of Black scholars – The Black Public Sphere Collective – began conceptualizing a Black public sphere in the mid-1990s. Based on the work of the Black Public Sphere Collective, this research aims to identify Black Podcasts as a counter public sphere whose significance lies in its potential to help construct or disrupt narratives about the Black experience in America.</p>
<p>While Habermas envisions the public sphere as highbrow, culturally significant, exclusionary spaces for elites, historically, the Black public sphere has included such spaces as the Black church, hair salons, barber shops, community corner stores, and Black-owned and operated publications<a class="footnote-ref" href="#blackpub1995"> [blackpub1995] </a>. Advances in technology created the means for people to connect across the nation and the globe so that the Black public sphere is no longer confined geographically; instead, Black people throughout the diaspora across class lines, gender identities, and age groups have the opportunity to participate in discourse about the past, present, and future of the diaspora<a class="footnote-ref" href="#collins2010"> [collins2010] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#squires2002"> [squires2002] </a>. Studies that examine Black-centered public discourse find that participants feel free to express themselves without fear of alienating the dominant group. Within these spaces, Black people, people of color, and allies debate and commiserate about a range of topics from microaggressions within the work place; police-involved shootings of unarmed Black people; shared cultural and regional language; and in some instances, they use these spaces to reclaim and rearticulate Black collective memories of historical protest groups (such as The Black Panthers) as a way to create counter-memories that disrupt the dominant media’s narrative of a post-racial society<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2014a"> [florini2014a] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#payton2012"> [payton2012] </a>.</p>
<p>Despite the potential of the Black public sphere to be a significant site of Black discourse, limitations do exist. This is especially true considering that worldviews and perspectives are also shaped, to some extent, by one’s experiences related to gender expression, socioeconomic status, disability, and sexual identity<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hopkinson2018"> [hopkinson2018] </a>. As Dill and Zambrana point out, many people within a marginalized group are also situated in multiple and competing systems of social stratification based on class, ethnicity, geographic location, and even skin color<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dill2009"> [dill2009] </a>. While The Collective examined physical spaces (barber shops and churches) and cultural spaces (Hip-Hop music and movies) to examine Black-centered discourse, since then, other scholars have acknowledged online spaces as sites of critical Black-centered discourse<a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2012"> [brock2012] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2014b"> [florini2014b] </a>. The combination of the educational nature of podcasts along with its capability to foster resistance raises questions about the medium’s potential to serve as a critical site of discourse to develop new pathways to Black liberation; therefore, this study limits its analysis to the following broad themes: community-building, resistance, and voice.</p>
<h2 id="background-on-podcasting">Background on Podcasting</h2>
<p>A podcast is defined as an episodic digital audio file that is consumed from either streaming on or downloading from a computer, mobile phone, or other digital device<a class="footnote-ref" href="#newman2019"> [newman2019] </a>. Although the term was coined by Ben Hammersley in 2004, as an amalgamation of Apple’siPodandbroadcast, the creation of podcast technology can be traced to Dave Winer’s development of Really Simple Syndication (RSS) software in 2000 that allowed for the creation of digital feeds that could push audio content to subscribers<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bottomley2015"> [bottomley2015] </a>. Podcasting was largely considered to be niche until 2014 when what is referred to as the “boom” occurred. This boom is largely credited to the success of the podcast <em>Serial</em> , which received millions of downloads in a short period of time and became the first podcast to win a Peabody award<a class="footnote-ref" href="#berry2016"> [berry2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bottomley2015"> [bottomley2015] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#newman2019"> [newman2019] </a>. Yee notes that since 2014, podcasts have grown from more of a niche hobby for what could be considered theaverageperson to becoming a platform leveraged by media personalities in order to strengthen their personal brand<a class="footnote-ref" href="#yee2019"> [yee2019] </a>. Podcasts are usually free to listeners and available for download from a variety of Internet hosting sites<a class="footnote-ref" href="#berry2006"> [berry2006] </a>. Based upon Apple’s listings alone, there are approximately 770,000 existing podcasts as of 2019<a class="footnote-ref" href="#newman2019"> [newman2019] </a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ubiquity of podcasts makes it an ideal medium to reach mass audiences. In 2013, Apple announced its one-billionth podcast subscription<a class="footnote-ref" href="#zickuhr2013"> [zickuhr2013] </a>. According to research conducted by Edison Research and Triton Digital survey data, as of 2018, more than half of Americans over the age of 12 have listened to a podcast at some point, which is up from 9% in 2008<a class="footnote-ref" href="#audio2019"> [audio2019] </a>. Some of the most popular mainstream podcasts, such as those hosted by National Public Radio (NPR), boasted more than seven million listeners in 2018<a class="footnote-ref" href="#audio2019"> [audio2019] </a>. Podcasting has also become quite lucrative. A yearly study conducted by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicts that podcast advertising revenue will reach over one billion dollars by the year 2021<a class="footnote-ref" href="#audio2019"> [audio2019] </a>. Unfortunately, it is not clear what percentage of these advertising dollars will be used to support Black podcasts because there is still very little data and research available that centers Black podcasts.</p>
<p>Similar to other popular user-generated media such as blogging, podcasts challenge barriers that limit media ownership and provide a space for marginalized voices to have a platform. Therefore, it is important to consider the ways marginalized groups leverage podcasts for social justice, resistance, education, community, and more. This research is concerned with the ways Black podcasters use podcasting as a medium to create a counter-public and the resulting implications for the future of Black-centered public discourse.</p>
<h2 id="black-podcasting">Black Podcasting</h2>
<p>Danielle &ldquo;Berry&rdquo; Sykes, a Black woman and self-proclaimed lover of podcasts, launched her website<a href="https://www.podcastsincolor.com/">PodcastsInColor.com</a>in March 2015 as a means to catalogue and memorialize Black and other people of color (POC)-centered podcasts<a class="footnote-ref" href="#berryND"> [berryND] </a>. Sykes recognized the lack of visibility for marginalized groups’ podcasts on major podcasts lists; leveraging the power of Black Twitter, Sykes put out a call for Black podcasters to send her links to their podcasts. What started as a simple database of Black podcasts has since developed into the most comprehensive list of Black and other POC podcasts available on the Internet. Though PodcastsInColor.com does not purport to have a complete list of Black podcasts, it is significant for demonstrating the breadth of Black podcasts.</p>
<p>According to Florini, Black people use the medium of podcasting as a counter-public in much the same way that Black people have used public spaces such as Black barbershops and beauty salons to engage in Black-centered discourse and to organize and promote social justice movements<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2015"> [florini2015] </a>. In the analysis of the Black online media network, <em>This Week in Blackness</em> or <em>TWiB!</em> , Florini notes that Black podcasters use their shows in addition to other platforms like Twitter to organize and mobilize political action<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2017"> [florini2017] </a>. Apiyo’s [2019] thesis research related to Black podcasting also supports the significance of Black podcasts in reinforcing cultural identity by producing specific, targeted content that centers the experiences, perceptions, and worldviews of the racial in-group<a class="footnote-ref" href="#apiyo2019"> [apiyo2019] </a>.</p>
<p>One important aspect of Black podcasts is the ways in which language serves as a significant cultural marker. Black podcasters use the medium to talk about news and information that is not typically covered on mainstream media, and they do so in a style not used in mainstream media — Black podcasters tend to embrace the use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2015"> [florini2015] </a>. Signifyin’, another sociolinguistic marker of the Black racial identity as described by Florini, is a popular style of banter used by several Black podcasters<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2014b"> [florini2014b] </a>. Signifyin’ describes the use of humor and sarcasm within cultural context, and it requires the listener to possess certain cultural, historical, and political knowledge to understand the resistance and double-consciousness embedded within the communication style. The practice of signifyin’, historically, was used by Black communities as a form of critique against the dominant group. Though Florini is specifically analyzing communication practices of Black Twitter users, this sociolinguistic feature can also be applied to Black podcasters, and this is demonstrated in the way many Black hosts name their podcasts<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2014b"> [florini2014b] </a>. As an example, the podcast, <em>The Black Guy Who Tips</em> , is sarcastically named as a means to resist the stereotype that Black people do not tip their wait staff in restaurants.</p>
<p>Podcasting, a convergent medium, has served as an important outlet for Black creatives and content creators — Black podcasters have been able to use relatively inexpensive digital technologies to build mediated communities, contest their marginalization, provide a counter-narrative to stereotypes, and assert a more nuanced perspective on current issues facing Black communities globally. Similar to social media, podcasts allow for the masses to navigate around more traditional media gatekeepers to produce their own content. Also, like social media, podcasts have been proven to operate as sites of resistance for marginalized groups especially as it relates to issues with media representation.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p><em>Podcasts in Color</em> serves as the primary source of data because it is the largest comprehensive directory of podcasts by people of color<a class="footnote-ref" href="#berryND"> [berryND] </a>. The website lists hundreds of Black podcasts on a broad range of topics with hosts from a broad range of backgrounds. The data set was collected from <em>Podcasts in Color’s</em>  “2018 Top Podcasts” list which was compiled by Sykes, the website administrator, and based on host and listener feedback. The “2018 Top Podcasts” list contains a range of podcast categories that include comedy, women-hosted, LGBTQIA-hosted, art and culture, and business. This list yielded an initial population of 100 podcasts. From this list, 20 podcasts were randomly selected to be examined by both researchers. This meant that each podcast had an equal chance of being selected for analysis. Random sampling was selected as a means to generate an unbiased sample of the data population. The appendix contains a full list of the podcasts included in this study.</p>
<p>Podcasts included within the sample met the following criteria: (1) the podcast had at least one Black-identified host; (2) the podcast was included on the <em>Podcasts in Color</em>  “2018 Top Podcasts” list; (3) the podcast produced an episode within the timeframe of April 1, 2019 to April 1, 2020; and (4) the podcast was accessible via the Apple podcast application. The researchers acknowledge that podcasts are accessible through a number of applications such as Stitcher, SoundCloud, Spotify, and Podmatic; however, the Apple podcast application tends to be the most widely used to access podcasts.</p>
<p>After the sample list of Black podcasts was developed, the researchers selected the most popular episode within the specified timeframe for each podcast according to ratings available through Apple iTunes as of April 3, 2020. Each researcher independently listened to each of the selected episodes and identified the most prevalent topics covered on each episode, along with a short summary of the key points covered under each topic. While listening to the episodes, the researchers incorporated an audio analyzing methodology utilized by Lindgren that “involves stopping frequently to take notes about the content” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#lindgren2021"> [lindgren2021] </a>, and wrote down the timestamps of quotes that they believed best represented the identified topics. After independently identifying key topics and points for each episode, the researchers reconvened to compare observations, organize notes, and synthesize findings. Show topics included mainstream news stories; pop culture stories; and personal narratives related to sexism, Black women’s participation in motor sports, people-pleasing, fashion, community-building, graphic design, self-care, the 2020 pandemic related to COVID-19, health, women’s empowerment, entrepreneurship, religion, race, music, and travel. Through discussion, the researchers synthesized reoccurring, underlying topics which apply to the broad themes of community-building, resistance, and voice. The most prevalent topics among the podcasts selected for analysis were identity, self-definition, Black visibility, community, and resistance. Specific examples to illustrate the significance of each topic are analyzed in the following section.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>In popular Black podcast style, the five topics analyzed are aptly renamed: We are not a Monolith (identity); I Looked at Myself, and I said,Self(self-definition); Everywhere You Think We Ain’t (Black visibility); U-N-I-T-Y (community); and Going Against the Grain (resistance). Keeping in line with the signifyin’ that occurs within Black podcasts, both in the language used in conversations and the show titles, the researchers embrace the practice of signifyin’ through the naming of each topic to emphasize the double-consciousness embedded in Black discourse.</p>
<p>The first topic, identity, which represents the range of diverse identities in Black podcasting and summarized in theWe Are Not a Monolithsection, focuses on the breadth of perspectives based on varying life experiences related to region, ethnicity, gender expression, sexual identity and more. The title of the section is significant as, in recent years, it has become a popular phrase used to recognize the diversity of Black people. The second topic self-definition, represented by theI Look at Myself and said, Selfsection describes different podcasters’ means of self-exploration. The section title is a paraphrase of a quote from the 2008 Tyler Perry movie <em>Meet the Browns</em> . Although delivered as a comedic line, the phrase represents the current push for self-reflection and growth.</p>
<p>The third topic Black visibility orEverywhere You Think We Ain’taddresses the issue of representation, or rather a lack thereof, for Black people, and this topic highlights the stories and experiences of those who occupy spaces (hobbies, regions, jobs) where Black people are under-represented. The fourth topic of community, which represents the community building that occurs within Black podcasts in theU-N-I-T-Ysection, concentrates on the ways that Black podcasters use their platform as a means to connect with and address issues within their communities. The section title derives its name from the 1993 Grammy award-winning rap song by mogul Queen Latifah, and this classic rap song is about creating unity and strengthening the Black community. The final topic – resistance – is summarized in theGoing Against the Grainsection.Going against the grainis a popular colloquialism, and within the context of this study, its meaning is more straightforward as this section describes how Black podcasters debate and discuss resistance to invisibility and marginalization.</p>
<h2 id="we-are-not-a-monolith">We Are Not a Monolith</h2>
<p>The podcasts selected for analysis highlighted a wide variety of perspectives based on a variety of identities related to gender, sexuality, class, and nationality. This first topic refers to the intersecting identities embraced by the podcasts’ hosts rather than the specific content produced in that there was such a broad range of Black identities represented and acknowledged. As an example, <em>Jesus and Jollof</em> is hosted by two Nigerian-American women who incorporate their experiences of being the children of immigrants into their conversations. One co-host, Yvonne Orji stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re listening and you are a child of immigrants, this is how we adopt people pleasing. We&rsquo;ve all been there when your mom is like,ahh. I have to make a pot of stew for the meeting. I’m so tired I just worked 40 hours. Oh, but if I don’t, if I don’t do it then they’ll say I’m a bad person<a class="footnote-ref" href="#orji2020"> [orji2020] </a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within this conversation, the hosts are stating that there are some experiences and sentiments that are distinct to Black immigrants that influence their actions and feelings. Orji’s comments suggest that an urge to please others at the detriment to oneself might be one result of those experiences.</p>
<p>Florini’s work acknowledged that Black podcasters, likely due to a sense of comfort stemming from being in a Black mediated space, tend to embrace the use of AAVE<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2015"> [florini2015] </a>. This was found to be the case for many of the podcasts in this study, however, shows such as <em>Jesus and Jollof</em> , <em>Black Gals Livin Podcast</em> and <em>I Said What I Said</em> expand that notion as all of the hosts of the included podcasts are not African American. The latter two podcasts have hosts that reside in the United Kingdom and Nigeria, respectively. It would be more appropriate to say that Black podcasters embrace their own regional dialects and accents while speaking English that incorporates their varied identities whether it consists of being American, British, Nigerian, etc. or a combination of multiple identities.</p>
<p>Podcasts such as <em>Whoreible Decisions</em> , <em>Keep It</em> , <em>HIM.</em> and <em>Strange Fruit</em> are ones in which the hosts identify as members of the LGBTQIA community and their content reflects that experience. On these shows, the hosts often insert perspectives and experiences that those who are not members of the LGBTQIA community would likely not share. For example, <em>Strange Fruit</em> contained a conversation with Dr. Ibram X. Kendi that spoke to how society views Black LGBTQIA people as inferior to Black, cisgender, heterosexual people, which impacts their lived experiences. The show, by discussing a court case in which an employee’s pay was allegedly cut once their employer found out he was gay, exampled that some of these different experiences could manifest as workplace discrimination.</p>
<p>Although one’s identity as a marginalized person influences one’s experience and will often be reflected in conversations, it is important that Black people are not confined to this narrative. For example, a large part of <em>HIM.</em> &rsquo;s episode was a conversation on dating and the five love languages. It is important that the hosts were free to have a general conversation on dating without it having to be specifically about dating as a gay Black man.</p>
<p>These diverse identities are important in that they help to showcase there are multiple perspectives and experiences that encompass the Black experience, giving even more credence to the adage thatwe are not a monolith.These podcasts prove that the Black experience is not just limited to straight, cisgender, American men. These podcasts highlight the differing experiences inherent in the Black identity, and this is an important factor to highlight in Black media. Black podcasts make it much easier to expose these varied Black experiences to help combat the few and often negative depictions of Black people in mainstream media<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wilson2013"> [wilson2013] </a>.</p>
<h2 id="i-looked-at-myself-and-i-saidself">I Looked at Myself, and I said,Self</h2>
<p>Common across all the podcasts was a focus onself– self-healing, self-motivation, self-acceptance, self-love, self-employment, and self-care. Although these can all have very different meanings and applications, a common topic of the podcasts revolved around motivating listeners to look inward, reflect and become attuned with one’s needs. Much of the focus on self was in response to the trauma that structural oppression places upon Black people. This is especially true for the messages of self-care, self-love and self-healing. The podcast hosts and guests recognized that oppression inflicts a severe amount of trauma, both mental and physical, upon Black people; Black podcasters advocate for their listeners to take the time to care for themselves. Shelah Marie, the guest on <em>Dreams in Drive</em> , a podcast focused on entrepreneurship and hosted by Rana Campbell, provided insights on what led her to creating a healing space and stated that “women of color, and especially Black women, are tired of being told about themselves by people who are not Black. We’re tired of being told how to heal by people who are not sharing our same journey” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#campbell2019"> [campbell2019] </a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the podcasts also recognized that society’s negative depictions of Black people can sometimes influence one’s own ideas about their Blackness, which is why self-acceptance was also present. In relation to this, Bose Ogulu, the guest on <em>I Said What I Said</em> , a podcast hosted by FK and Jollz, two Black millennial women living in Lagos, spoke about being fortunate to grow up in a household that taught her about the harm to global Black populations resulting from apartheid and colonization. As a result of gaining this understanding at an early age, she “grew with the realization that I was Black. African. Umm, that wouldn’t change. So part of being comfortable in your own skin is accepting and embracing yourself” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#abudu2019"> [abudu2019] </a>. The guest goes on to speak about how part of being able to embrace her Blackness is also tied to her ability to travel and engage with Black people in different countries and recognize similarities in culture while understanding that the perceived divisions among Black people were created by colonizers<a class="footnote-ref" href="#abudu2019"> [abudu2019] </a>.</p>
<p>In addition, some podcasts also pushed forth the idea of self-employment as a way for Black people to take more control of their own lives and careers. Both the hosts, Nubia Younge and Frantzces Lys, and guest, Sha’Cannon, on <em>Chronicles Abroad</em> , a podcast dedicated to Black women living as expatriates, spoke at length about the need to move away from working in the traditional corporate America structure because of the stress it caused. Sha’Cannon spoke about having to deal with poor leadership, office politics, working extra hours, and various other hurdles that prevent one being able to enjoy their work. She proclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re just not happy. And then when you finally get a chance to get vacations approved. Did you hear that? You know, I have to ask for what is supposed to be a benefit to me. You know.Can I go away? Because you’re draining the shit out of me. Can I go recharge?You know, once you get it approved and you go, you almost can’t enjoy the vacation, because it’s short lived you know… by the time you really are into the vacation it’s over and you’re damn near depressed because you have to do what? Go back to the traffic and corporate America<a class="footnote-ref" href="#younge2020"> [younge2020] </a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this statement, there is an expression of the levels of stress that can come along with working for someone else, especially under the corporate America structure, thus positioning self-employment as a more freeing option.</p>
<p>Something of importance to note in these examples is that Black podcasts often encourage Black people to reach out across the diaspora in order to gain a greater sense of self. This is especially so for the concepts of self-healing and self-acceptance. Several of these podcasts seem to recognize the damage that White supremacy has done to Black people and view the Black diaspora as a restorative resource.</p>
<h2 id="everywhere-you-think-we-aint">Everywhere You Think We Ain’t</h2>
<p>Several of the podcasts focused on increasing visibility of Black, and sometimes other marginalized groups, in areas that they are normally not represented. This includes traveling abroad, certain pop culture spaces, and the graphic designing world. As an example, on the episode of <em>Chronicles Abroad</em> , Nubia exclaimed that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chronicles Abroad</em> started because when we were, you know researching, or when I was researching, I didn’t find people that look like us. You know. Or in our age bracket. So that’s how it got started. And then I was so surprised that once I moved abroad, there were so many of us out here<a class="footnote-ref" href="#younge2020"> [younge2020] </a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nubia’s comments speak to her podcast having an explicit intent to fill a void in the lack of representation of Black people as international travelers.</p>
<p><em>Revision Path</em> is a podcast dedicated to highlighting Black digital creatives, artists, designers and developers who normally go unnoticed within mainstream design industries. During the introduction, the show’s creator explains that the podcast is a, “weekly showcase of the world’s Black graphic designers, web designers and web developers. Through in-depth interviews you learn about their work, their goals and what inspires them as creative individuals” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cherry2020"> [cherry2020] </a>. Although much of the interview focused on gaining insights on the guest’s experiences and career in graphic design, it was clear that race was a significant factor in the guest’s career trajectory — the guest often mentioned the issues he faced being one of the few Black graphic designers in the industry.</p>
<p>The focus on featuring Black people in spaces where Black people are not typically visible in mainstream media is evident in a number of other podcasts. For example, the analyzed episode of <em>Strange Fruit</em> included a segment that focused on Black women motorcycle clubs, and the guest on <em>Dreams in Drive</em> discussed the impetus for launching her self-care business, noting that there were very few visible women in this space.</p>
<h2 id="u-n-i-t-y">U-N-I-T-Y</h2>
<p>While the concept of community-building was a broad theme examined in this study, topics related to community gatherings, community development, and grassroot organization tended to be a significant topic in most of the podcasts analyzed. Some of the podcasts focused on discussing different ways that the Black community could be uplifted; some podcasts commented on national Black liberation, and others commented on strategies for freedom specific to Black women and queer communities. <em>Tea with Queen and J.</em> exemplify this with their “Pay Black Women Segment” in which they promote the financial support of Black and Indigenous women, cisgender women and transwomen, as well as non-gender conforming Black and Indigenous people, by highlighting a person or persons who the listeners should support. By doing this, the hosts acknowledge that Black people who are not straight, cisgender men face many more obstacles and forms of oppression and are often overlooked in society.</p>
<p>Similarly, Malik Little, one of the hosts of <em>HIM.</em> , spoke about the efforts he makes to support the Black queer community by providing food, shelter and funds if needed. The host voiced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know me bitch. If anyone of y’all talm’bout some y’all need a haircut, y’all need food. There have been people who have hit me up through the podcast who’ve asked for food, and bitch their refrigerators have been fulled. And y’all know how I feel about that, and that’s just because of the things that I’ve been through here<a class="footnote-ref" href="#little2019"> [little2019] </a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is of importance here is that the host is connecting how the podcast itself plays a role in supporting their community. He is not only exampling how he supports those who he personally knows in need, but also those who solicit help via the podcast.</p>
<p>Additionally, Alex Elle, the host of the <em>hey, girl</em> podcast, which espouses sisterhood among Black women, spoke about the importance of building community for self-care. She stated that, “For me, building community is important for my self-care, accountability and just for having a support system” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#elle2019"> [elle2019] </a>. This sentiment was also shared on other podcasts, especially in reference to maintaining one’s sense of self in quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic. Podcast hosts also spoke of building a stronger podcast community by promoting stronger engagement with their listeners or other Black podcasts. Many of the podcasts have segments where they read listener emails or encourage the continuation of the conversation on social media with the hosts and other listeners.</p>
<h2 id="going-against-the-grain">Going Against the Grain</h2>
<p>Ever present within many of the podcasts was a sense of resistance, both directly and indirectly. All of the prior topics can be viewed as acts of resistance in their own way and all of the observed episodes held some resistance to structural oppression to varying degrees. Some shows such as <em>Tea with Queen and J</em> are direct about it; in their introduction, they state their intent to dismantle “White supremacist patriarchal capitalism” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#muhammad2020"> [muhammad2020] </a>. While some of the other podcasts might not state it as blatantly, their actions push against the status quo. For example, the guest on <em>Chronicles Abroad</em> spoke at length about self-employment and moving further away from the stress and constraints that corporate America creates<a class="footnote-ref" href="#younge2020"> [younge2020] </a>. Myliek Teele, founder and owner of a popular subscription service that features Black beauty products, encourages her show’s listeners to “make sure that you’re putting the same energy and effort into your personal life as you are into your professional life” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#teele2019"> [teele2019] </a>. For Black women, who are often taught to put everyone before their own needs, this serves as a means of resistance.</p>
<p>As most of the podcast hosts identify as women and/or queer, much of the conversations also included resistance against sexism, transphobia, homophobia and other intersecting points of oppression. For example, on <em>Strange Fruit</em> the hosts’ conversation with Dr. Ibram X. Kendi discussed how cisgendered, heterosexual Black men do not make up the entirety of the Black population and to defend Black people, you must also defend Black women and LGBTQ people. Furthermore, it was also acknowledged that even though Black women and LGBTQ people often face the most vitriol within the community, they are also the ones who are most prominent in organizing for Black liberation. The Black Lives Matter movement, which is largely lead by Black women and LGBTQ people, was cited as a significant example<a class="footnote-ref" href="#story2019"> [story2019] </a>.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this study was to identify the significance of Black podcasts as a counter public sphere meant to construct or disrupt narratives about the Black experience in America. Using the Black public sphere as a guide and placing Black podcasting within the context of more traditional forms of Black media, this research primarily focused on three broad themes of community-building, resistance, and voice. To distinguish these themes from the aforementioned topics, the five topics identified in the analysis represent the most prevalent discussion points covered in the podcasts. These topics were then used to help explain Black podcasts’ unique contributions to the overarching themes of community-building, resistance, and voice that are present in the Black media landscape at large.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>Community-building among Black podcasters is a significant theme within this study, made most evident by theU-N-I-T-Ytopic. This is not surprising considering, historically, Black media such as print news, has been a unifying force for Black communities. This study demonstrates that podcasters utilize their platforms as a beacon to attract and engage community members and provide links to resources. In some respects, some podcasts, such as <em>hey, girl</em> and <em>Black Gals Livin’</em> , promoted the importance of community building, often discussing how it is important for one’s own self-care. In this way, the podcasts are essentially stressing the importance of having a support system, which is something that many marginalized people might feel they need living in a society founded on systemic inequality.</p>
<p>Some of the podcasts also promoted engagement with their own listeners, creating space for feedback through email and social media. Taking into account that podcasting is considered to be an intimate medium, one could view this as a way that the hosts are ensuring that their listeners feel even more included in the conversation. Although the scope of this study does not include an examination of the podcasts’ social media engagements, the promotion of continuing the conversation on different platforms allows for listeners of the show to connect with other listeners, potentially building a digital community around the podcast. Some of the shows also mentioned and promoted other Black podcasts and social media accounts, implying that the hosts recognize the importance of promoting other marginalized voices. This ideally creates a loose network that helps to link listeners to other Black resources and communities.</p>
<p>Some of the podcasts also use their platform to support the Black community outside of the digital space. This is perhaps best noted in <em>Tea with Queen and J.</em> and <em>HIM</em> . In the former, the hosts have a segment dedicated to financially supporting Black people who do not identify as cisgender males because they recognize how they are disproportionally disparaged in society and may be in need of extra financial assistance. The requests made in this segment can range from asking for support of a business, organization or initiative to sending money so that a particular individual can buy food. Although it is not an official segment of <em>HIM.</em> , one of the hosts did speak about how he responds to requests made by the podcast listeners for food or financial assistance. In these varying ways, Black podcasts have a tendency to be community-oriented and are using their platforms to support the Black community, especially those whose life experiences are negatively impacted by multiple and intersecting systems of oppression. Black podcasters may also view their podcasts as a way to digitally connect different parts of the community that may be geographically separated.</p>
<h2 id="resistant">Resistant</h2>
<p>Historically, traditional forms of media have not been representative of Black people both in terms of quantity and quality, which results in the perpetuation of Black stereotypes. Black media have been critical for resisting these stereotypes by providing counter-narratives of the Black experience. The second theme, resistance, shows up in a number of ways in Black discourse via Black podcasting, and this is primarily done by the increased representation of diverse Black voices and worldviews.</p>
<p>The topicsWe Are Not a MonolithandEverywhere You Think We Ain’tdemonstrate that Black podcasts are pushing against dominant narratives of Black people, which limits them to being categorized as one of a few different stereotypes, by showcasing just how varied our voices are. The hosts were experienced and engaged in a range of different topics and areas including, but not limited to sex, pop culture, graphic design, nutrition, traveling abroad, entrepreneurship, and the music industry. Simply placing Black voices in these spaces is an act of resistance against the false perception that Black people are not present there or capable of holding knowledge on a multitude of topics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the hosts did not identify as straight, cisgender men, who are the dominant group within a patriarchal society. To the same effect that increasing the visibility of Black voices in media is a form of resistance against racial oppression, incorporating the voices, perspectives and lived experiences of people with intersecting, marginalized identities is an act of resistance against misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia, etc. Oppression in the form of racism has severely narrowed the representation of the Black experience in media, and Black podcasts are contributing to broadening that perspective.</p>
<p>The poor representations of Black people in media can have a negative effect on how Black people view themselves. Therefore, ideas of self-love and self-acceptance as described in theI Look at Myself and Said, Selfsection suggests that self-reflection and self-definition can also be considered a radical form of resistance. Accepting and loving one’s own Blackness leads to accepting others’ definition of Blackness and has the potential to promote community building.</p>
<p>Aside from self-definition as a form of resistance, some of the podcasts were much more straightforward in their notion of resistance and used their platform to lambaste White supremacist patriarchal capitalism. While the hosts of <em>Tea with Queen and J.</em> are the only Black podcasters (within this study) to explicitly state this as the purpose of their podcast, many others shared similar sentiments. At various points during the episodes analyzed, the hosts would critique capitalism, racism, sexism and homophobia. Sometimes the criticism was indirect, as was the case in <em>Chronicles Abroad</em> where the hosts and guest made several comments speaking to how flawed and stressful the structure of corporate America is. Other times it might present as a blatant statement such as the one made by one host of the <em>HIM.</em> podcast, “We’re all living in this capitalist bullshit society” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#little2019"> [little2019] </a>. In <em>Jesus and Jollof</em> , one of the hosts made a reference to how men often use the term “crazy” to reduce and define women who make demands that the man is incapable of fulfilling<a class="footnote-ref" href="#orji2020"> [orji2020] </a>. As this analysis suggests, resistance for Black podcasters has different meanings and different potentiality; however, it is clear that for Black podcasters, the concept of resistance is both meaningful and significant, which historically, has always been a primary mission of Black media.</p>
<h2 id="voice">Voice</h2>
<p>The third theme examined in this study focused on the diversity of voice within the Black public sphere. For this study, voice describes more than just the sonic representation of Blackness (though that is significant as well); voice also describes the perspective, attitude, and opinion of different Black people whose life experiences have been shaped by the region where they live or grew up, their socioeconomic class, their sexual identity, their gender, and to some extent a shared history of slavery. Black podcasts expand the Black public sphere, increasing the number of voices that participate in it, therefore making it more representative of the diversity of Black communities globally.</p>
<p>Perhaps, what is the most unique about Black podcasts is the medium itself. As the literature uncovered, podcasting as a digital medium is widely accessible and creates an avenue for individuals to navigate around traditional media gatekeepers<a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2015"> [florini2015] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#steele2018"> [steele2018] </a>. This generates an opportunity for more Black people to build an online platform and share it widely; including those who might not have access to own and/or participate in more traditional media formats as a result of barriers related to class, gender, sexual identity, disability, and various other factors.</p>
<p>Beyond helping to remove media gatekeepers and financial barriers, Black podcasting as a digital medium also help to remove geographical barriers, which adds to the diversity of voice. With the help of digital technology, listeners can access shows hosted by Black people throughout the diaspora. While Black newspapers and Black radio were often limited in their reach, Black podcasts can attract Black listeners from nearly anywhere in the world. Nigerian podcast shows such as <em>I Said What I Said</em> have the potential to expand their listener base to Americans; conversely, Nigerian listeners can also access Black American podcasts such as <em>Dreams in Drive</em> – this is how cross-cultural interactions happen. Therefore, public discourse that may once have been locally confined can now invite a wider range of voices and people to participate globally. Whether physical or intangible, the barriers that podcasts remove allow for more Black people of varying identities and experiences to participate in public discourse with each other.</p>
<p>While scholars such as Thakur argue that the digital landscape creates too many voices, making it difficult to have one single agenda, it is important that Black people are recognized as a diverse group<a class="footnote-ref" href="#thakur2020"> [thakur2020] </a>. As a diverse group of people, Black communities will have different interests and needs. TheWe Are Not a MonolithandEverywhere You Think We Ain’ttopics provide examples of the variety of Blackness from identities to geographic locations to hobbies and career interests. Furthermore, theU-N-I-T-Ytopic shows that, even among all of these varying voices, there still exists a unifying desire to uplift all Black people. Black podcasts recognize that efforts aimed at supporting the unique needs of different Black communities do not have to be at odds with each other and can serve to uplift Black people as a whole. Black podcasting highlights the diversity of Black critical debate and it offers a space for the development of cross-cultural interactions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Using a sample of 20 podcasts, this study demonstrates the significant contributions Black podcasts have made to the Black public sphere. Despite podcasting’s major contributions to Black representation, Black media production, Black resistance, and Black community building, this study focuses on a small sample of Black podcasts, therefore, some limitations do exist. Considering the breadth of platforms available to create and listen to podcasts and the fact that there is not an all-inclusive database, several podcasts were not included in the data population. Future research should compile a more comprehensive list of Black podcasts and analyze a larger sample. Additionally, this research explores Black podcast commentary but does not focus on audience engagement. Future research should also consider examining audience engagement to determine how Black podcasting shapes audience perceptions about topics salient to the Black community. Finally, research demonstrates that not all Black voices and experiences are represented equally within the Black public sphere, therefore, future research should take a more intentionally intersectional approach to exploring Black podcasts to ensure that women, LGBTQIA, disabled and other marginalized voices across the Black diaspora are included.</p>

Black Women’s Lives Matter. The lives of Black women such as Saartjie Baartman, Anna Julia Cooper, Charlotte Maxeke, Victoria Earle Matthews, Antoinette Sithole, Pauline Hopkins, and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela have mattered greatly. Yet, for many, these names mean very little. For others, many of these women were pioneers, and some might even argue, Afro-Futurists, women who seemingly anticipated the urgency of DH debates during these pandemic-ridden times, who looked at progress, social change, and world-building in Black communities well before others of their day. As a scholar of race, gender, and the built environment, I could not help but have Black women’s lives matter to me. In the U.S. and South Africa (where much of my current scholarly work is situated) the lives of Black women in racial uplift have always been critical, but have never been properly valued, documented, or recognized. Black women’s lives matter in both of these geo-political contexts because of the labor they contributed in the making of the empires of both the English in colonial America and the Dutch in the Cape Colony of Southern Africa. These histories cannot continue to be ignored, erased, overlooked, or silenced without making certain of the many contributions that were made at great personal and collective costs by so many Black and Brown women – these same women who ultimately found ways to begin dismantling the legacy of settler-colonialism<a class="footnote-ref" href="#nieves2020"> [nieves2020] </a>. These histories are unique in many significant ways, but the tools of white supremacy, racial capitalism, and genocide are very much the common thread that stitches these living tableaus together. I remind you what Audre Lorde once wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house. They may allow us to temporarily beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. Racism and homophobia are real conditions of all our lives in this place and time. I urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives here. See whose face it wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all our choices.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lorde2007"> [lorde2007] </a><br>
I have, since 2004, been working in South Africa on a series of digital projects informed by community-driven participatory practices. That work has raised a number of issues for me, and what I consider to be some of the core values that are needed today when working in Black DH – values especially informed by feminist and intersectional epistemologies. Working to establish a series of foundational guidelines for this work reminds me that I was the signatory of an earlier call to action, the “eBlack Studies Manifesto” , sponsored by the African-American Studies Department at the University of Illinois Urbana in 2008 that defines eBlack studies as “the ongoing application of current digital information technology towards the production, dissemination, and collection of historical knowledge critical to the discipline of Black Studies and to the overall black experience” &ldquo;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#alkalimat2008"> [alkalimat2008] </a>. The authors, of whom I was just one out of fifteen, outlined nine imperatives to guide and grow the fledgling discipline. Some 16+ years later we have grown eBlack Studies significantly, despite daunting challenges faced during the economic crisis of that same year in 2008, and the subsequent global recession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, a queer scholar of color who still cannot easily separate my everyday lived reality from my activist and social justice-based pedagogies – the kind of activism that embraces thepersonal is political– I am often left to wonder how scholarly practice for some in the ivory tower are just what they do from 9am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. As a Black DH practitioner who cannot ignore my own positionality as a scholar of color, I do not see a neat separation between my day-to-day lived reality from my digital practices. And as I write this short reflection piece, we are once again facing a global crisis, a pandemic, brought on by COVID-19 that has impacted Black and Brown people, here in the U.S., and across the African Diaspora, in disproportionate numbers. We might never know the full extent of the damage done by the pandemic because of the mis-handling and willful neglect of the necessary data to more fully and qualitatively document its impact.</p>
<p>So, what is possible when those who have long been the victims of racial hatred, violence, and segregation learn to harness themaster’s tools? I urge us to consider a new way forward, for a Black DH, that as a social movement and as a political project once again challenges the still white-dominated field of digital humanities without hesitation or apology – and is unapologetic about its commitment to racial justice. Black DH, as Moya Bailey, Kim Gallon, and Jessica Marie Johnson have argued elsewhere, should be simultaneously experimental, analytical, computational, speculative, and have unique design capabilities as a series of practices and in shaping the field’s future<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2015"> [bailey2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#day2020"> [day2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2018"> [johnson2018] </a>. In response, we have already seen large-scale efforts, often funded by Foundations outside the academy, to address the kind of disciplinary focus of, and adherence to the dominant fields and tools created in support of a very Eurocentric-focused model for digital humanities – something we continue to see at our yearly international Association of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) conference with significant pushback from our European colleagues who disavow race as a legitimate category of analysis or humanistic inquiry<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ciotti2017"> [ciotti2017] </a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately we have been able to break free from that white-male centered, heteronormative, overtly text-based monolingual analytic focus, making significant inroads through DH2018 in Mexico City and other interventions across the Americas, the Caribbean, and digital projects that readily engage with racial justice including the African American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities (AADHUM) program at the University of Maryland-College Park; the Colored Conventions Project (CCP) at the Pennsylvania State University; the Forum on Digital Ethnic Studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; and the History of Black Writing (HBW) at the University of Kansas-Lawrence, and the Reckonings Project at Northeastern University. Each of these institutions is making significant progress in training students and modeling the kind of scholarship that is currently needed to address racial and systemic inequalities in digital humanities. With institutional support, and alliances with one or two senior faculty who have also leveraged their positions in their respective fields (along with their reputations), Black DH is becoming more “mainstream.” However, it is still seen at many institutions as niche or the result of digital faddism, or worse, is subject to the pressures of neo-liberal administrators seeking new funding streams for embattled Black, African American, and Africana Studies Programs and/or Departments. Rectifying the financial and socio-political imbalance of Black, African American, and Africana Studies Programs and/or Departments must come along with the full embrace of digital humanities. All this still impedes a clear way forward for Black DH without some sort of agreed upon set of practices, community building strategies, and new knowledge-making frameworks. Fortunately, this special issue of <em>DHQ</em> that looks ahead and features the work of a new generation of digital scholars, provides us with the sorts of examples where Black DH is now heading.</p>
<p>Therefore, much like the “eBlack Studies Manifesto” , I too propose a set of key practices, an alternative primer, for Black DH projects in this special issue. I propose that we in the Black DH community consider these ten principles of practice:</p>
<p>Build opportunities to promote collaborative co-creation models of teaching and research, while also understanding that collaboration requires a VERY different conception of project timelines, workflows, deliverables, and expectations when undertaking a Black DH project;Find ways to address the need for multi-layered, messy, truth-telling narratives about the Black experience across the African Diaspora that confront embedded legacies of race, racism, and anti-Blackness;Value the process of scholarly inquiry, Black knowledge-making, and discovery over the final product;Study power, privilege, and access as a series interconnected technologies that have been used to disempower Black communities, narratives, and forms of cultural production and that require a different way forward for practicing a Black DH (for eg. understanding power and how best to address power relations);Help librarians, archivists, and information specialists working to advance Black DH projects/scholarship to embrace their own positionality;Harness the breadth of digital expertise, in Black social media, and Black software and hardware design while developing new forms of digital scholarship;Promote an ethics of care in Black DH practices, especially in teaching and research;Articulate new DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) opportunities and programs to coincide with the making of a range of Black DH projects, especially in the service of racial and social justice;Develop a complex theoretical and applied Black DH framework where Black politics and ideologies are embedded in its methods, pedagogies, and research practices;Center and immediately prioritize Black women and queer voices and perspectives in Black DH.</p>
<p>I started this essay naming some of the many women from across the African Diaspora who have influenced my own feminist digital scholarly praxis and who deserve further research. Finding ways of bridging Black women’s lived realities while also attempting to articulate some guidelines for doing the work of Black DH (and embracing the phrase,the personal is political) is worthy of discussing and debating further, but only as to those next, actionable steps. Inaction is not acceptable.Pearl clutching, hand-wringing, and talking things to their untimely demise can no longer be the default. Instead, institutions of higher education must pivot from their dependence on soft-moneysupport(on external monies that do not necessarily seed long-term pedagogical change) and, instead, begin now to endow student and community-based Black DH practices. We must find more creative long-term funding strategies that help us pay community partners for their time and labor on projects, if we are serious about acknowledging their contributions in co-creation. It is said that for every crisis there exists also an opportunity. Today’s pandemic and economic downturn mark exactly the right moment to make these steps part of every institution’s new set of priorities over the next decade.</p>

<p>If we were to create a timeline of significant events in the rise of the digital humanities, then 2008 would certainly be a year of great importance. The National Endowment for the Humanities <a href="https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/dhi-now-odh">announced</a> the creation of a new office: The Office of Digital Humanities. However, an event that might be missed in the genealogy of the digital humanities and significance of 2008 is that a month later the conference,<a href="https://archive.mith.umd.edu/diaspora2008/"> “Digital Diasporas: Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies” </a>occurred at the University of Maryland from April 30th to May 3rd. “Digital Diasporas” was the first conference of its kind to bring together the fields of digital humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies, though certainly not the first efforts to establish a relationship between Blackness and digital technologies in the Academy. For that origin story, we might look to 1983 and The<a href="https://hbw.ku.edu/"> <em>History of Black Writing (HBW) Project</em> </a>by Maryemma Graham. As an early Black digital humanities (Black DH) project, the HBW project, then known asThe Computer Assisted Analysis of Black Literature,recovered Black writing through a comprehensive checklist and database. Thus, in 2008, the “Digital Diasporas” conference was a manifestation of decades of work by Graham and other Black scholars in charting a relationship between digital technologies and knowledge about the Black experience.</p>
<p>Ten years later, in 2018, the<a href="https://arhu.umd.edu/events/conference-intentionally-digital-intentionally-black"> “Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black” </a>conference, which also took place at the University of Maryland from October 18th to October 20th in 2018, expanded the connection between the digital humanities and Blackness. For example, the Digital Diasporas conference featured Alexander G. Weheliye’s project, “Black Studies and the Digital Archive” which sought to expand the contours of the field with the digital life of resources on Blackness. “Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black,” also featured projects and scholarship which examined the ways that gender, race and technology operate online through Black women’s use of social media as represented by the panel, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0f-V4VQqA">Always at Work: Black Women Online</a>.” In addition,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhOvS4y3dtU">This Code Cracks: A #BlackCodeStudies</a>roundtable featured Marisa Parham who presented her work, “<a href="https://mp285.com/sections/portfolio/">.break.dance</a>” a project that explores the interplay between Blackness, time, space, and digital experiences through basic web technologies such as html, javascript, and css. These two events, separated by a decade, highlights the ways Black Studies scholars have not simply kept apace but also anticipated the development of the digital humanities as a field, and more importantly the rise of Black DH. In essence, Black DH work has consistently been on the cutting edge of the digital humanities.</p>
<p>Presently, a<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZwucjyAAR7QiEZl238_hhRPXo5-UKXt2_KCrwPZkiQ/edit">list</a>of over 400 projects and scholarship, that is maintained by the “<a href="https://coloredconventions.org/">Colored Conventions Project</a>” , indicates the growth of Black DH that demonstrates the value of the work that recovers and restores Black humanity. Yet, even as we continue to see exciting work in Black DH emerge, there are only a few projects that center topics such as Black pleasure and sexuality. Many projects on the list are focused on Black people’s historical and contemporary struggle for liberation. This should not surprise the avid student of the Black experience. In some sense, Black DH has followed the trajectory of traditional scholarship on the Black life and its investment in heteronormative values and respectability politics that tend to focus on Blackness in relationship to the struggles for social justice.</p>
<p>Still, the outlook for work that examines expansive notions of Blackness is bright when we look at a small but growing body of Black DH undertakings. For example, Camille Lawrence’s project, the “<a href="https://www.blackbeautyarchives.org/">Black Beauty Archives</a>” takes up beauty culture in the African diaspora through digitized images of beauty tools, magazines, and advertisements and creates a digital space where pleasure and joy are located, shaped, and developed from Black aesthetics. Similarly, “<a href="https://www.blacklesbianarchives.com/">The Black Lesbian Archives</a>” by Krü Maekdo uses music, videos, and still images to powerfully archive and curate the rich history of Black lesbians’ lives and experiences throughout the United States and beyond. Finally, LaShawn Pittman’s “<a href="https://realblackgrandmothers.com/">Real Black Grandmothers</a>” not only offers a digital archive of Black grandmothers’ lifesaving role in Black communities but provides an opportunity for people to playfully participate in the cultivation of a digital space where Black grandmother wit and “<a href="https://realblackgrandmothers.com/her-sayings/">sayings</a>” are preserved and shared through Twitter.</p>
<p>Together, these three projects represent the future of Black DH through digital humanists&rsquo; use of digital technologies to recover the joy and pleasure of Blackness.</p>

Following their initial inquiry, I raised concern around the language ofinclusion,countering that inclusion implies bringing people into an already existing center. I asked if their BIPOC users really wanted to be included or if they wanted to be allowed to exist on the platform without being disproportionately surveilled. My ability to garner the attention of a social media platform and then critique its work is not something I envisioned for myself when I started out in DH.</p>
<p>As an elder millennial, born in the US, I was an early adopter of multiple digital platforms. I was a high school student who built my own website in HTML and a college student who used LiveJournal and Blogspot to connect with a community of women of color activists and artists who grew up online. I used Ning to create a niche Facebook for quirky Black girls and we used Last.FM, Blip, Friendster, Myspace, and whatever else existed, to make room for ourselves on the internet. We shaped corners of those platforms into little safe havens of connection that allowed us to develop our leftist political thinking as we endeavored to make change in the communities from which we came. We were feminists, womanists, radical women of color finding our voices in the liminal spaces of the internet and it was beautiful.</p>
<p>As a grad student at Emory University, I was able to link the organizing I was doing through digital platforms to digital tools I could use in my research, something that had previously never occurred to me. It was at THATCamp Southeast, one of the initial THATCamps that energized the field of digital humanities in the US, that I saw the possibility of bridging my digital activism with my scholarship. The Humanities and Technology Camp was my first encounter with an unconference, where we as participants created the sessions we wanted to attend. In these sessions I learned how to use Omeka, ViewShare (R.I.P.), Voyant and other digital tools from the people who created them. I transformed my dissertation with digital tools that made my project more compelling and easier to execute. THATCamp introduced me to the field of DH and I was instantly connected to the network of blogs, and later tweets, that were the central nodes of DH community.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long to realize that the same issues that me and my social justice minded social media friends lamented, were alive and well in DH. The field was a boys’ club, a white boys’ club at that, and there was such an emphasis on doing and building, that critique and reflection were considered ancillary. An early blog post I wrote, “All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave,” addressed this all too familiar phenomenon of the DH big tent’s inability to recognize its own practitioners if they didn’t fit a conventional mold<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2011"> [bailey2011] </a>. The piece was shepherded through the publication process by Natalie Cecire who used her relative postdoc privilege to add an addendum to the first issue of the <em>Journal of Digital Humanities</em> that brought critical theory into the DH mix. The zero degrees of separation of a small but digitally invested field, connected through well-funded unconferences and conferences alike, fueled my ability to get published, get a postdoc position myself, and ultimately helped me land a tenure track job.</p>
<p>And yet, I can’t help but feel the sails of DH starting to deflate. THATCamps are almost entirely gone as the initially generous philanthropic Mellon Foundation funding ran out. DH blogs and Twitter posts have reached a saturation point that thwarts the communal watercooler conversations they used to encourage. The big tent of DH has gotten bigger in terms of faculty and librarians who see themselves as practitioners in the field but the number of graduate students looking to DH for career advancement seems to be plateauing if not dwindling in the US. DH and alt-ac careers are slowly losing their shiny veneer as the market itself offers fewer options for all PhD graduates.</p>
<p>The early concerns of hack vs. yack – can you code or are you just talking about code – remain entrenched and I worry that students are still subtly taught that their DH doesn’tcountif it’s not heavier on the digital than it is on the humanities. I see students trying to teach themselves coding languages on top of completing their regular coursework. Initiatives to bring HBCUs and liberal arts colleges into the DH universe seem to be about making these smaller communities mirror the larger better funded universities when these schools don’t have the same capacity. Simple tools that make our research easier to do and more accessible to students and communities remain on the margins of the field’s center of gravity. The way that digital pedagogy and its practitioners are subtly disparaged and considered less authentically DH comes to mind.</p>
<p>At the same time, I am heartened by the persistent if not growing number of BIPOC in the field of DH and its companion disciplines of communication studies and computer science. The creators of this volume and their white allies are doing the work to ensure that DH remains attentive to issues of race, ability, sexuality, and class as the ground of the field continues to shift. Texts like this one provide such an important possibility model for DH collaborative work and I hope we are in store for more.</p>

<p>By <em>infrastructure</em> , I mean the full suite of social and technological systems that converge in DH and the work of memory institutions: platforms and tools, certainly; but also systems of selection, arrangement, and description of cultural materials deemed worthy of attention — and the practices that shape those decisions at scale, distributing or reifying authority, security, and privilege. These latter range from our very conception of how funding and resourcing can function in this sphere, to our practices of hiring, evaluating scholars for tenure and promotion, and instituting organizational habits and patterns that either retain and uplift people of color or harm and drive them away. It is tempting to frame this complex and eroded infrastructure — in all its overwhelming fullness — as something the present generation of DH scholars, librarians, archivists, museum workers, technologists, and administrators has simply inherited and must drag along. But that would be to diminish the shaping role of the choices we make within living systems, every day.</p>
<p>There is no longer any excuse for disengagement with what an activist Black or Africana studies offers the digital humanities. Black scholarship and organizing on the one hand, and human survival and flourishing on the other are deeply interlinked. Professions and institutions that persist in old patterns without surcease — despite overwhelming evidence that change is needed and a better world is possible — participate in the same willfully self-destructive logics that drive environmental degradation, piss-poor pandemic response, and emboldened White supremacy.</p>
<p>I offer here — as an invitedmeta-reflection— a brief set of concepts and concerns that have become most meaningful to me as an academic and administrator, in setting my own agendas and the organizational ones I am able to influence.</p>
<p>First, thanks to scholars like Johnson, Moya Bailey, Kim Gallon, Marisa Parham, and Safiya Noble, we can feel increasingly confident that an unfruitful techno-utopianism in DH is well and truly dead. It is now evident that the same tools and systems that make generative and counter-cultural Black digital practice possible have the potential to be (or already are) technologies of misrepresentation and misogynoir, of the continued quantification of BIPOC bodies, and of surveillance and control.</p>
<p>But that is not to say that more hopeful, technological futures have been foreclosed. I hang my hopes on a core tenet of Afrofuturism, as outlined by Kodwo Eshun and other artists and thinkers: that <em>the primary marker of a people’s autonomy lies in their ability to craft and control their own, collective intellectual infrastructure</em> . I therefore ask: what generational imaginations will be liberated, for the benefit of everyone, when cultural heritage systems, digital libraries, and techno-social platforms of all kinds are built around new philosophies of organization and community ownership — for instance, no longer on progress narratives and master-slave or parent-child paradigms, or on admin/moderator-based models of control, but on frameworks with roots in <em>ubuntu</em> , cooperatively governed, holistically understood, and nurtured to new ends?</p>
<p>The implications for our digital libraries, archives, museums, and research infrastructures are extreme. As just one example — which, inspired by Rasheedah Phillips, I have explored in a number of talks and essays — truly supporting Black futures will not only require ceding ownership over history and its digital delivery mechanisms, but even challenging regulated, linear time.</p>
<p>Doing this needed design work requires <em>a fundamental shift, not only in institutional but in personal control</em> . I believe that the majority-white generation of leaders who presently dominate cultural heritage and DH need to make this shift possible, by deliberately leveraging our power and privilege to resource Black-led projects and to position BIPOC, queer, and other minoritized colleagues as voices of authority. Then, most importantly, we need to get out of the way.</p>
<p>The same systems that have positioned us to do this work will — at a moment when “diversity” efforts have become institutionally trendy — reinforce and reward our remaining in loci of power past our usefulness in supporting others. Alternately, such systems will remove us prematurely when it becomes evident we do not support <em>them</em> . Therefore, we must commit to the project, wherever it takes us. It is also crucial we recognize and vocally acknowledge that our (perhaps newly) good and earnest intent does not wipe away past harms or preclude new ones, nor does it substitute for the embodied experiences and deep expertise of scholars and archivists of Black culture.</p>
<p><em>Capital, too, can be shifted</em> , as we have recently seen through the altered priorities and patterns of decision-making that have come with changes in leadership in our major funding agencies. This shift needs to happen in our libraries, digital humanities centers, museums, and archives as well — for budgets are moral documents. Resourcing cannot productively proceed along the charity-based frameworks that groups like the Shift Collective identify as problematic in funding community archives, and which have propped up what <em>INCITE!</em> terms thenonprofit industrial complex<a class="footnote-ref" href="#incite2017"> [incite2017] </a>. Scholars of race, class, and labor (whose work reinforces the expressed, lived experiences of presumed beneficiaries of such partnerships and gifts) demonstrate compellingly that large organizations too often work against their ostensible and noble aims — serving instead to extract resources and, in the case of nonprofits, not to elevate dissent, but to channel and quell it.</p>
<p>Instead, robust networks of <em>mutual aid</em> — based in equity and reciprocity, and meeting actual, core needs of our communities — are as necessary in DH and digital libraries as they are in the urban and rural settings of our failing state. The daily maintenance and long-term sustainability of digital humanities projects (not merely as technical systems but as <em>human</em> ones) is an unsolved problem in our institutions and town-gown collaborations as currently configured. Top-down funding models, well directed, can spark desperately needed, momentary change — but may never sustain nor truly serve the goals of a new, grassroots Black digital practice.</p>
<p>Most fundamentally, <em>we do not know what will happen</em> if we succeed in empowering and centering people, collections, and community concerns that have long been marginalized. We don’t know <em>what</em> true shifts in resources and authority might bring. We don’t know what an Afrofuturist digital discovery and cultural heritage platform might look like — because we have never had one. New scholars and practitioners of the digital humanities in search of research questions may find <em>these</em> the most exciting, over-arching ones in our field.</p>
<p>The intersection of Black studies with DH and digital cultural heritage reminds us to think across time and globally, through the Diaspora — understanding that abolition, memory, the creation and use of tools, and the political, ecological, and interdisciplinary projects of decolonization are on trajectories long and broad. We have pathways forward and tantalizing hints, but can scarcely imagine what it will mean to shift from extractive modes of digital research and curation — quantifying, fragmenting, pinning, hoarding — to ones that are generative, healing, open-ended, and which make us whole. What might we build next?</p>

Maybe it began on instant messaging platforms like AIM or MSN Messenger, truncating, puttying, and shaping language for new platforms. Maybe it was in re-watching early viral videos — “Chocolate Rain” still is and always will be a bop — and thinking they related to something that might mean identity. Or perhaps it came earlier with the affective thrill on hearing the distinct buzz of a dial-up internet connection, so foreign a sound whirring through Caribbean breeze. I know it wasn’t in a classroom, or — no offense Mavis Beacon — learning how to type, or formatting a resume in MS Word ’95. See, the appeal of the digital to me, aninside chilegrowing up in Trinidad (face usually in a book or screen) never was assimilation into some larger arc of intellectual or technologicalprogressor change; one thing that drew me in to thinking about the ways digital technologies culture us or how we culture them was possibility. And I don’t mean possibility in thediscoveryorrecoverysense: I refuse the idea that the goal of Black digital technologies and their uses remains building some Black canon of texts, some particular archive of artifacts, a catalogue of ways of being in the world somehow authentically emerging fromBlack experience.I also refuse the notion thatBlack digital humanitiesmight help us find some place among the long arching shadow that is the figure of the “human,” even as snuff videos stay circulating of cops killing us with pleas for humanity on social media. I suppose possibility, to me, conjures constant shift(in’)-forms.</p>
<p>Following Black feminist scholars and activists who take up approaches to digital humanities situated in a Wynterian theoretical genealogy, like Tara L. Conley and Ashley Greene Wade for example, I understand digital technologies and media for their viral potentials to undercut the overrepresentation of man as Western bourgeois male subject, as human<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conley2017"> [conley2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#greenewade2017"> [greenewade2017] </a>. But my hope in virality lies not in building a single vision or static versions of what might mechanize responses to Sylvia Wynter’s call for “new genres of being human” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#wynter2007"> [wynter2007] </a>. Nah, I believe that virality inherently offers — through distribution — constant space for mashing up contexts, artifacts, identities, and the very frameworks on which settler-colonial, racial capitalist projects lie. We need not construct or overrepresent sub-genres of what being “human while Black” might look like by digital means and watch them appropriated toward our own demise. The plurality of Wynter’s call (in <em>genres</em> , rather than genre) suggests that Black studies might offer the digital the idea that no singlehumanorhumanisticmetric, discipline, or idea may measure or signify Blackness <em>in toto</em> . #BlackGirlMagic, #BlackBoyJoy, #BlackLivesMatter, none need look or mean one way because Blackness don’t need to look one way. Magic, joy, whatever don’t have to <em>matter</em> according to normative (affective) scripts. Difference — which Achille Mbembe reminds us Blackness signifies in extremity — rather, suggests we could augur n/other planets: places, terrains, digital geographies where reiterative negation of otherhood might help us fever dream something different<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mbembe2013"> [mbembe2013] </a>. Together, by using digital media to turbulently disturb, spread, alter any received sense of what we are or could be in the continued heat of racial capitalism, let’s dream nutha planets.</p>

<p>I came to digital humanities through Black Studies, looking for answers to a question — and found more questions. But the answer was always clear: we are the ones we’ve been waiting for to create the space for digital humanities to more fully realize the promise of the democratization of knowledge and to improve representation of minoritized communities in the digital cultural record.</p>
<p>In the late 2000s, beginning my dissertation on what W.E.B. Du Bois called the “global color line,” I struggled with the limits of written text as I tried to articulate flows of knowledge between social movements influenced by Black radicalism. Paper seemed ill-equipped to contain what was coming to life as a vibrant, multidirectional exchange around the world. Every attempt to pin it down seemed a pale (pun intended) representation of beautiful complexity that lived in institutional and community archives.</p>
<p>One day, everything changed. Doing research in the Huey Newton Papers at Stanford University, I came across subscriber rolls of <em>The Black Panther</em> newspaper, a globally circulated periodical from the Black Panther Party. While many countries represented on the rolls were unremarkable given the history of Black internationalism (Cuba, the USSR, Algeria), others were surprising (Norway, Denmark, Poland). Perhaps, if I could put this data on a map, I’d have a heuristic to think through ideas I struggled to commit to paper. A digital humanist was born.</p>
<p>I didn’t know this was calleddigital humanities,and I’m not sure many who were working in the burgeoning field knew that either.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> While digital humanities has well-documented, if contested, roots in areas like humanities computing and computer and writing, I found digital humanities — and digital humanities found me — in its early years, not long after the termdigital humanitieshad been introduced through publication of <em>The Blackwell Companion to Digital Humanities</em> in 2004.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Becoming part of a conversation in its nascent moments, where the terms of the engagement were being hashed out in the early 2010s — and, unusually for academic discourse, hashed out through Twitter hashtags — was empowering and discouraging in equal measure, particularly when one comes to it as I did: as an answer to methodological problems I encountered in Black Studies. I had not come to digital humanities through the same routes of other digital humanists of my generation, many of whom were graduate students at universities with senior digital humanities scholars, but by accident.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Not having a pedigree linking me to the emerging community of digital humanists was simultaneously liberating and precarious. I was conscious — and anxious — that I didn’t have anyone in the senior ranks to vouch for me,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> but I also had the freedom to raise concerns, at times pugnaciously, about where discussions of race fit into digital humanities. During those early conversations on Twitter in the early 2010s, which accelerated the formation of digital humanities, I quickly realized that while two senior scholars — Amy Earhart and Tara McPherson<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> — were asking trenchant questions about race, it really wasn’t a topic that many white digital humanists wanted to touch. And, to be blunt, entering that conversation — particularly as a woman of color — was terrifying.</p>
<p>Mercifully, I was not alone. While Twitter was a point of entry into the fray of digital humanities, it was also where I began to find my people — other graduate students of color, as well as senior allies and those in adjacent fields like new media studies, who’d found their way to digital humanities and shared my concerns about the ways that digital humanities elided questions of race and colonialism.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> We set about finding new friends and building new worlds within digital humanities, hoping that the next generation of graduate students working in Black Studies and other ethnic studies fields could find a place without having to fight to make a place. Starting in the early 2010s, though this work remains ongoing, we created projects, organizations, journals, and scholarship to clear space for digital humanities in many areas of study — Black Studies, Caribbean studies, Latinx studies, Native and Indigenous studies, postcolonial studies.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>But there were battles every step of the way.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> While it’s no longer controversial to address race in digital humanities in the early 2020s, these were tough conversations in the late 2000s and early 2010s. As was explained to me in my early days in digital humanities, the most visible, senior scholars in digital humanities had been toiling in obscurity, their voices unheard, their scholarship misunderstood for so long. And their work was finally being recognized — digital humanities had stepped onto the red carpet in our professional organizations, and it was <em>their</em> time. It was not <em>our</em> time.</p>
<p>I have never been swayed by arguments about whosetimeit is because power — in this case, the power of academic discourse — operates precisely by dividing and conquering competing claims. It forces a fictive sense of prioritization, the sense that only one pressing need or concern can be at the forefront of conversation. Instead, the question we should be examining is how addressing the operations of race — and its relationship to gender, sexuality, nation, disability, and colonialism, among others — is nothing less than a matter of scholarly integrity and must be put at the center of digital humanities inquiry.</p>
<p>We aren’t there yet — but could be. And now <em>is</em> the time. It’s always been our time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By memory, those fond associations and ties of love which unite us together on earth, will be preserved in eternity&hellip;Memory should be cultivated. Like all other faculties of the mind and body, its vigor and activity depend on its exercise. The more the memory is exercised the stronger it becomes.<br>
<em>-J.B. Harrison, Greenville Settlement, 1864</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>95-year-old Cleo Fay Goens Mason is determined to narrate her own story. In her words, “Everybody has their own idea of what’s important. And you have to respect that” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#mason2019b"> [mason2019b] </a>. Perhaps this was a lesson she learned from her mother, who kept the books at Bethel Wesleyan Church in the early 1900s and held on to many of the items that adorned her during her life. Mrs. Mason, like her mother, is a memory keeper and descendant of the historic Longtown community, formerly known as the Greenville Black Settlement and now visible as Longtown on a map of Ohio. Mrs. Mason’s participation in the September 29, 2019 history harvest at the annual homecoming of Longtown, and the deliberate ways in which she unveiled her family&rsquo;s heirlooms, suggests that her memory work is a practice cultivated across generations to bridge the gap of time and space between ancestor and descendant, between past and present, between the collections built by an individual and those housed in independent community archives<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mason2019a"> [mason2019a] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#flinn2009"> [flinn2009] </a>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason’s contributions to <em><a href="https://longtownhistory.github.io">Remembering Freedom: Longtown and Greenville History Harvest</a></em> , henceforth <em>Remembering Freedom History Harvest</em> , extend her own memory work into a collaborative space that includes both Longtown descendants and a group of researchers and volunteers from Indiana University–Bloomington<a class="footnote-ref" href="#powell2018"> [powell2018] </a>. Like other history harvests, this history harvest paired the ethical concerns of community archiving with university partners, including the Institute for Digital Arts &amp; Humanities and the Center for Research on Race and Ethnicity in Society, to digitize, preserve and showcase community historical artifacts in an open-source digital archive project<a class="footnote-ref" href="#universityofnebraska"> [universityofnebraska] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#rondo2017"> [rondo2017] </a>. This shifts focus away from mainstream archives, the collections of predominantly white institutions that pose as inclusive and representative but fail to label Black people and their material as authoritative and constitutive. Women like Mrs. Mason and her female ancestors often show up in these institutional archives, both physical and digital, as nameless, faceless, victimized, objectified, or in the perspectives of others<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cifor2018"> [cifor2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#zavala2017"> [zavala2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#hartman2019"> [hartman2019] </a>. Like the <em><a href="https://omeka.macalester.edu/rondo/">Remembering Rondo History Harvest</a></em> , <em>Remembering Freedom</em> was created, and will be owned and sustained, by the individuals who have defined these descendant communities, foregrounding what rural Black women have been able to accomplish, across time and space, through an inherited practice of preservation work.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mason’s own ancestors shaped and preserved the memories that she then preserved for her own granddaughters and contributed to the <em>Remembering Freedom</em> in a conversation between individual, ancestral line and contemporary community that we are calling <em>descendant archival practices</em> . This approach explores alternative conceptions of community archives and memory work to expand the definition of slavery’s archive specifically. From historical documents stored in manila folders and cardboard boxes to memories invoked at her own will or with her granddaughter’s persuasion, Mrs. Mason’s individual contributions to the Longtown history harvest reveal the strategies of memory keeping individual women contributed to the communal legacies of Longtown’s history, which have not been erased but were instead preserved in plain sight. They left marks on the land they bequeathed their descendants, at the schools and churches in which they labored, in the secret rooms fugitive women used as safe havens, in the photographs they commissioned to recast the image of Black womanhood, and in the documents they passed down to their children and grandchildren.</p>

<p><em>Descendant archival practices</em> cites as experts the many generations of Black women elders whose memory work preserves their history, and it holds as custodians the present generations of Black women whose power and agency connects their memory-work inheritance with their future descendants. The <em>Remembering Freedom History Harvest</em> builds on these intergenerational processes — which encompass on the collaborative aspects of community archiving, the individual actions of descendants who choose to keep their family’s histories, and the collection practices of history harvests — to examine free and fugitive Black women’s experiences of freedom in the rural Midwest who have been overlooked in accounts of slavery and freedom. Over the past five years Jazma Sutton has worked collaboratively with individual Longtown descendants to center the sources, archives, and narratives produced by nineteenth-century Black women and their descendants, illuminate the multiplicity of archives that descendants of free and enslaved people have managed to create and preserve despite the constraints of white colonial power and white supremacy. <em>Descendant archival practice</em> foregrounds the individual and communal archival power of Black women, past and present, to “confront inequalities of power in the production of sources” as we look toward a digital future<a class="footnote-ref" href="#trouillot2015"> [trouillot2015] </a>. The project thus grapples with the methodological and ethical concerns situated between archival excess and absence across the digital and analog divide. In a world that has always conceived of Black women in opposition to others, but never on her own terms, <em>Remembering Freedom History Harvest</em> builds a local Indiana historiography that relies less on resistant readings of archives and more on the community archives and memory work that join together in <em>descendant archival practice</em> as a way to generate Black women’s histories.</p>
<h2 id="sowing-the-seeds">Sowing the Seeds</h2>
<p>The Greenville Settlement, which overlapped the borders of Indiana and Ohio, was one of the earliest and most prosperous Black communities in the region. The settlement was founded in 1818 in Darke County, Ohio, by James and Sophia Clemens. By 1822, it extended over the state-line into Randolph County, Indiana where Thornton Alexander purchased the first tract of Black-owned land in the county. At times, Indiana and Ohio both passed state laws that prohibited immigration into the state, denied access to public schools, promoted Black immigration to Africa, and stripped Black people of any rights and privileges in court. Despite this, by the mid nineteenth century the free and fugitive Black people of Greenville had collectively amassed the most Black-owned land of any county in Indiana. They had established Wesleyan and African Methodist Episcopal Churches, founded an integrated, co-educational school of manual labor known as the Union Literary Institute (ULI), and operated safehouses on the Underground Railroad. In these ways, Greenville pioneers forged a community that was conducive to rural life and anti-slavery activism.</p>
<p>Today, the Clemens farmstead, a disintegrating ULI school building, and three cemeteries, one of which stands neglected in the middle of a white-owned farm, are all that remain of the settlement’s built-environment. The joint forces of racial violence, industrialization, agricultural innovation, and mass migration decreased the Black population of Longtown to 0.76%. Roane Smothers, a family historian, asserts “When this has happened at other African American settlements, the buildings and cemeteries were demolished and the story about these African American pioneers are forgotten and buried” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#staff2015"> [staff2015] </a>. Sustained resistance to archival and cultural erasure has allowed Longtown descendants to digitize hundreds of historical documents and artifacts, to obtain historical markers, and to restore old buildings and register them on the National Register of Historic Places and as Underground Railroad sites with the National Park Service. Despite what Greenville descendants have been able to achieve through grassroots preservation practices, we still know very little about the women who W.E.B. Du Bois noted, after visiting the settlement in 1909, “took hold of the community” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dubois1909"> [dubois1909] </a>.</p>

<p>In this changing landscape of the Indiana-Ohio borderland, it was the women of Greenville and Longtown who carried its history into the present. Prior to the Civil War, Greenville women created spaces for themselves as free people, citizens, and women. Landownership and rural seclusion enabled Black women to raise families that could not be separated or destroyed, to educate their children, and to manage their own farms and homes. They labored as mothers, wives, caregivers, farm hands, and community leaders for the sake of community survival. The meager evidence that exists about Greenville women in male family members’ estate records, white men’s and women’s reminiscences of the Underground Railroad, and some oral histories suggest that they were savvy. They adjusted to, and spearheaded at times, the latest agricultural, technological, industrial, and political advancements in arguably one of the most anti-Black states in the Midwest at that time — Indiana.</p>
<h2 id="nurturing-the-archive">Nurturing the Archive</h2>
<p>The historical examination of slavery and freedom in the Northwest Territory (present-day Midwest) has been slow. A move towards engaging the lives of free, enslaved and fugitive Black women who lived in the territory’s hundreds of free Black communities has lagged even further behind. Scholars like Erica Armstrong Dunbar, Amrita Chakrabarti Myers and Jessica Millward focus on urban spaces, pushing us to consider enslaved and free Black women’s lived experiences of freedom, their definitions of freedom, and the varying degrees of freedom they occupied. To a certain extent, they each rely on traditional records such as court records, wills, church minutes, city directories, other official documents, and in rare cases like <em>A Fragile Freedom</em> , Black women’s friendship albums to partially piece together the lives of free Black women who often left little to no sources behind about their lives<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dunbar2008"> [dunbar2008] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#dunbar2017"> [dunbar2017] </a>. In <em>Forging Freedom</em> , some of these women were considered exceptional, having owned property and other enslaved people, yet they appear in the archive, not strictly in their own right, but mainly as a result of their legal negotiations or sexual relations with white men<a class="footnote-ref" href="#myers2011"> [myers2011] </a>. Millward, in <em>Finding Charity’s Folk</em> is fortunate to have one formerly enslaved woman’s manumission papers, will, and court case, but is also aware that these records alone can not reconstruct the multifacet lives of enslaved and free Black women. In search of Charity Folk whose “ghost refuses to be silent” , Millward turns to memory, descendants of enslavers and enslaved people, historical buildings, and cemeteries to chronicle the life of a single woman<a class="footnote-ref" href="#millward2015"> [millward2015] </a>. In <em>All That She Carried: The Journey of Ashley’s Sack, a Black Family Keepsake</em> , historian Tiya Miles uses a single artifact from Black women’s material culture — a sack filled with a tattered dress, three handfuls of pecans, and a braid of hair, which one enslaved woman bequeathed her daughter before being sold away — to trace the lives of a mother, daughter, and granddaughter trio during slavery and its immediate aftermath. Miles’ treatment is an innovative assessment of the inheritance practices Black women drew on to maintain family connections between generations when the forces of slavery severed those connections all too readily<a class="footnote-ref" href="#miles2021"> [miles2021] </a>. Millward and Miles show us what is possible when historians of enslaved women step outside of the confines of the traditional archive and demonstrate the importance of naming <em>descendant archival practice</em> to acknowledge the many contexts in which it appears in Black women’s history.</p>
<p>Saidiya Hartman in “Venus in Two Acts” finds Black women in the “archives of slavery” in similar deplorable conditions — “No one remembered her name or recorded the things she said, or observed that she refused to say anything at all” . To make meaning of this sort of archival encounter with “Black Venus” , for Hartman, is akin to entering a mortuary — it permits one final viewing and allows for a last glimpse of persons about to disappear into the slave hold<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hartman2008"> [hartman2008] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#hartman2006"> [hartman2006] </a>. Her account is as much an account of the violence of the archive as it is of enslaved women. Like Hartman, in <em>Dispossessed Lives,</em> Marisa Fuentes, reckons with archival power, the violence of the archive, and the impossibilities of writing about Black women during slavery. While Hartman encourages historians to “respect the limits of what cannot be known” , Marisa Fuentes suggests that we stretch these limits by “reading against the bias grain” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#fuentes2016"> [fuentes2016] </a>. Instead of focusing solely on the lived experiences of enslaved women, she shifts her methods to examining the production of historical narratives that result from “archival fragments” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#fuentes2016"> [fuentes2016] </a>.</p>
<p>Black digital humanists have engaged a number of insurgent archival practices that, like <em>descendant archival practice</em> , model best-practice collaboration with community partners and bring digital methods to bear in both the practical and ideological transformation of tools and organizations that “resist and counteract slavery’s dehumanizing impulses” as Jessica Marie Johnson notes in “Markup Bodies: Black [Life] Studies and Slavery [Death] Studies at the Digital Crossroads” . Johnson further defines Black digital practice as “the revelation that Black subjects have themselves taken up science, data, and coding, in other words, have commodified themselves and digitized and mediated their own Black freedom dreams in order to hack their way into the system (modernity, science, the West), take root, and live where they were “never meant to survive” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2018"> [johnson2018] </a>. In that vein, <em>descendant archival practice</em> in <em>Remembering Freedom</em> echoes the engaging public-facing, community-based digital research done at #DigBlk, the Center for Black Digital Research at Penn State University in its community involvement. It orients towardinformationwith the intent of bringing technology into play as a platform for descendants to convene regular conversation, as do the spaces defined by eBlack Studies, Black social media, and conversations like those at the Afrofuturism listserv.</p>
<p>Descendant archival practice builds on the concept of community archiving to understand Black women’s personalized familycollectionsas sites of resistance, identity formation, and community empowerment<a class="footnote-ref" href="#zavala2017"> [zavala2017] </a>. While institutional examples of post-custodial approaches like the University of Texas Libraries or the University of Nebraska’s history harvest offer community empowerment through the collection of community owned objects, descendant archival practice offers a community-owned model built on history harvests like <em>Remembering Rondo</em> , in which the community and the institutional partner hold joint ownership of the digital records themselves<a class="footnote-ref" href="#alpert2019"> [alpert2019] </a>. This community ownership makes explicit the give and take between individual family record-keeping done by descendants and the labor required to build digital community histories that will continue to bind those discrete families together into a whole in the future<a class="footnote-ref" href="#alpert2019"> [alpert2019] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cook1994"> [cook1994] </a>.</p>
<p>Like the <em>South Asian American Digital Archive</em> , <em>Transgender Archive</em> , and <em>Documenting the Now</em> , the <em>Remembering Freedom History Harvest</em> acknowledges and respects the agency and values of rural Black communities, and emulates the participatory and activist approaches of exclusively digital post-custodial archives<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cifor2018"> [cifor2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#jules2018"> [jules2018] </a>. However, instead of focusing on the documentation of current events or a contemporary activist focus, <em>Remembering Freedom</em> is most interested in what the material culture of Black women can tell us about the intergenerational memory work of Black women descendants. In that way, descendant archival practice follows Black women archivists Chaitra Powell, Holly Smith, Shanee’ Murrain and Skyla Hearn, themselves connected to this culture of care and memory-keeping, in understanding how a culture of dissemblance and careful management of archival practices within a closed community keeps that community safe. As historian Vanessa Holden puts it “silence saves lives” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#holden2021a"> [holden2021a] </a>.</p>
<p>As these studies show, some of the most innovative methodologies for studying free, enslaved, and fugitive women have emerged from encounters with colonialism, silence, fragmentation, and violence in the archive. The <em>Remembering Freedom History Harvest</em> builds on these methods by examining free and fugitive Black women’s experiences of freedom in the rural Midwest who have been overlooked in accounts of slavery and freedom. As part of <em>descendant archival practice</em> , we expand the definition of the archive of slavery to include living individuals who hold, in their ancestry, an inheritance that keys to what is unknown. The major ethical concern driving the <em>Remembering Freedom History Harvest</em> is the normalization of silence and violence in the narratives, archives, and methods we use to write about Black women during slavery. At the same time, <em>descendant archival practice</em> does not accept that enslaved women must always appear nameless, faceless, and forgotten in the archives of slavery. In fact, attention to the preservation practices of descendants and other Black digital humanists who are concerned with centering overlooked Black communities and issues of accessibility allow us to create intentional practices to ensure that this does not happen in the future.</p>
<p>Because of its joint emphasis on openness and digital-community-engagement structure, the history harvest model offers a platform for enacting the elements of <em>descendent archival practice</em> that hold space for the individual and communal voices of Black women in particular. A more adequate counter-history of slavery — a history of the past and present intertwined — privileges the overlooked communities of descendants, the archives they have produced, and the stories they have to tell. For the descendants of Greenville, women have taken up this call. One such archive is<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Remembering-Freedom-James-Clemens-and-the-Longtown-Settlement-170627093017850/">their Facebook page, “Remembering Freedom” </a>, which serves as a core inspiration for this history harvest. As a digital archive, and an easy-to-use platform for community empowerment, the “Remembering Freedom” Facebook page echoes the technical expertise that has always been necessary for Black people to flourish in rural communities. The ability to learn, adapt, and invent technologies was one of the hidden hallmarks of free Black rural communities, and Longtown&rsquo;s women descendants are carrying on that tradition in digital and analog spaces. Its near-ubiquity as a social media platform — Pew Research estimates 69% of adults had Facebook accounts in 2019, and 74% of those users visited the site daily<a class="footnote-ref" href="#perrin2019"> [perrin2019] </a>— and its ease of use offers equitable access to Longtown descendants, historians and other interested parties from across many demographic groups to collaboratively fill the silences in Longtown’s history. At the same time, Facebook’s proprietary approach to and control over its data means that, without consideration for backups or presentation elsewhere, any digitized archives on Facebook’s platform are prone to unexpected loss and erasure (though to be fair, this isn’t a concern limited to Facebook for born-digital archives). Its algorithmic presentation of a “feed” selected for each user also serves to make the silences and gaps in that feed invisible and unknowable to the average Facebook visitor.</p>
<h2 id="reaping-the-harvest">Reaping the Harvest</h2>
<p>An emphasis on <em>descendant archival practice</em> helps surface the voices of enslaved, free, and fugitive Black communities in parallel with those of their individual descendants in the present. As we considered how to honor this parallel in both the in-person and digital components of the <em>Remembering Freedom History Harvest</em> , several projects informed our work. Some of these projects were good models for the technical and community-engagement portions of the history harvest; others provided grounded examples of our theoretical frameworks expressed in practice.</p>
<p>Our first reference point was the project’s namesake, the<a href="https://historyharvest.unl.edu">first history harvests at Nebraska</a>in 2013.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#universityofnebraska"> [universityofnebraska] </a>. The basic principle is built on community contribution of objects, with academic support in order to digitally preserve family heirlooms that might otherwise not be included in the historical record without removing them from the families whose history they tell. These history harvests provided a service-learning model that puts historians into dialogue with the public-history needs of local community members. Such digital-public-engagement projects foster collaboration between community members and the academy, a democratization of history that still maintains the academic-history connection between preservation and the analysis of change and continuity. While a later K-12 model extends the history-harvest practices to<a href="https://www.ops.org/InvisibleHistory"> “Invisible Histories” in Omaha’s minoritized communities</a>, the prominent early models presented in the<a href="https://historyharvest.net/?page_id=152"> “History Harvest Handbook” </a>are those in which undergraduates worked in classroom settings with largely white homesteader audiences in the communities surrounding Lincoln<a class="footnote-ref" href="#friefeld2015"> [friefeld2015] </a>. While contributions solicited by undergraduates from these rural Russian and German immigrant communities lack some representation in the archives, the experiences of rural white communities in general are already well represented in academic history.</p>
<p>To bridge that gap, we looked then to <em>Remembering Rondo</em> History Harvests for a community engagement model that emphasized the efforts of Detroit’s largest red-lined Black community working to preserve the community’s memory of the community before and after it was forcibly divided in 1956 by the construction of the I-94 freeway<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wingo2020"> [wingo2020] </a>. These history harvests focused on the importance of community agency and operational oversight, a process driven by now-retirement-age community members. The community’s interest in these history harvests were meant not just to preserve Rondo’s memory of itself before the I-94’s construction. The history harvest team also served as one prong of many community efforts to highlight and publicize Rondo’s unity through its long physical divide, as Rondo’s residents sought to address the physical reuniting of Rondo through, among other efforts, construction of a land-bridge over the I-94. Rondo’s model of community custody with university-provided sustainability, compared to the post-custodial models in previous history harvests, was particularly instructive.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked to the<a href="https://www.thetexasfreedomcoloniesproject.com">Texas Freedom Colonies Project</a>, which has elements of the community contributions that are central to history harvests but re-focuses the communal element of the history harvest on pre-existing Black community preservation practices that can be supported and extended through digital means<a class="footnote-ref" href="#roberts2018"> [roberts2018] </a>. This project is also driven by what founder Andrea Roberts, calls “critical sankofa planning — a process of looking back, believing there’s wisdom there, and applying that knowledge to current dilemmas” . As she points out, the social justice aim embedded in critical sankofa planning is especially relevant to “rural or unincorporated [black] spaces” like Longtown, dealing with “gentrification and cultural erasure” in the present.</p>
<p>To continue redressing the absences and erasure in the archive, we focused on five features that reshaped some of the history harvest digital conventions in ways that center the existing community practices unique to Longtown descendants. Two of these shifts were part of the history-harvest day itself. First, we were invited to participate in an already scheduled community homecoming day. We also shifted away from archival-level capture practices that emphasize specific preservation quality (and therefore equipment) requirements. Instead, we focused on low-cost easy-to-use equipment that community members would be likely to have on hand already (cell phones, desk lamps) or could purchase for very low cost (e.g. homemade cardboard lightboxes or inexpensive pop-up lightboxes to improve photo quality<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> ). Both of these considerations are directly connected to the idea of the archive as a nexus of community-academy partnership, rather than a site of academic praxis that seeks to meet purely academic standards.</p>
<p>The other three technical shifts are situated in the digital context of the history harvest: a series of vocabulary changes to the history harvest site, a move to<a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, and the interleaving of the community’s Facebook page with the history harvest page. Each of these technical considerations was driven by our digital-engagement theory. Compounded, all five draw on considerations of “racialized design” — an intentional challenge to uninterrogated project management and design standards that perpetuate racism<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mercer2019"> [mercer2019] </a>. The choice of Github Pages in particular meant that we could effectively support community custody of the web site with a free, stable, sustainable hosting solution that emphasizes simple, static web pages. That in turn allowed us to draw on university-sponsored resources and workflows to facilitate regularbackupsof the <em>Remembering Freedom History Harvest</em> web site on the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/2021*/https://longtownhistory.github.io">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a>, ensuring long-term public access to the site regardless of community hosting considerations. Together, these five changes radically transform the history harvest from a space that perpetuates “white colonial power” in present-day archives and narratives to one that truly promotes “innovative new authentic learning initiatives” for the future through the historical productions of overlooked people.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-pews-at-longtown">In the Pews at Longtown</h2>
<p>First, we scheduled the event day around several pre-existing community traditions centered on gathering at the physical site of Longtown and Greenville itself. Descendant Brenda Jett was responsible for organizing the event at the local Bethel Wesleyan Church, and she functioned as the main contact between researcher and community. Homecoming events like the one at which the history harvest took place are evidence of how the community sees its past as a source of identity and a guide for future conduct. The invitation to participate in the history harvest portion of the homecoming event was explicitly focused on memory as an heirloom. By signaling that oral histories rooted in the built environment itself, in an ancestral home, were equally valid as contributions of digitized family heirlooms, we acknowledged the silences of free and enslaved voices in archives that are often dependent on physical objects and traditional historical texts to anchor a community’s history.</p>
<p>Second, we centered the event on digitization tools that would minimize the amount of computing and technology necessary to generate a digital archive and situate that digitization effort in the community’s most familiar spaces<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gil2016"> [gil2016] </a>. This minimal-computing approach, which we address more fully below, allowed us to be flexible and take community direction once we arrived at the homecoming, rather than requesting guaranteed access to WiFi or power outlets, which might redirect community focus to our needs rather than theirs.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, we were invited to attend the community’s Homecoming church service. Our digitization efforts would be located at the church and began at the conclusion of the Homecoming ceremony. In a small room behind the sanctuary, where we were able to access a few power outlets, we set up a single, foldable light box, a scanner, and a sign-in table. Members crowded the space; some were holding a few folders, others carried boxes filled with decades-old materials. Still, others toted nothing but their personal stories and histories. We sent a few graduate and undergraduate students to the pews with handheld battery-powered audio recorders for interviews and began encouraging community members to fill out our paper forms.</p>
<p>Standing together in the small room, we issued directions and were also directed. One descendant sought accommodations for Shari Petersime, a family historian who is visually impaired. Shari, still residing in the Longtown area, contributed a draft of the family history book she was writing titled, “Only God Can Make a Tree: Tracing my Burden Family Roots” &ldquo;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#petersime2019"> [petersime2019] </a>. A couple of months after the history harvest, she contacted Sutton via phone and made arrangements to send her a copy of the final project. Sutton has since then cited the publication, which has a wealth of information on antebellum women from the settlement, in her dissertation and consulted Petersime’s expertise to weave together archival fragments. This is also when we first met Mrs. Mason, who offered the largest collection of documents and objects of any descendant. The particularity with which she handled her material or responded to our requests was evidence of the intentionality that generations of rural Black women have placed on how they wanted to be remembered. Mrs. Mason, highlights the ways in which rural Black women and their female descendants have subverted the fate of Black Venus. We could not ignore the care and concentration with which she chose the information she wanted to share from her personal archive.</p>

<p>As the example of Mrs. Mason makes clear, the amount of material to collect far exceeded the number of hands and time available to do the work of collecting. We worked with descendants to choose – or limit — what they wanted scanned, photographed, or recorded, but those choices were circumscribed by the sometimes-slow nature of high-quality digital capture. In some cases, we compromised the quality of the digitization process in order to acknowledge the importance of a memory or heirloom. In each of these cases, the question looming over our labor is one of theoretical, practical, and historical importance: Would those interested in seeing this archive, whether they be researchers, descendants of the public, “emerge from the encounter [with the archive] with a sense of incompleteness and with the recognition that some part of the self is missing as a consequence of this engagement?” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hartman2008"> [hartman2008] </a>. We were compelled to contend with the possibility that, in our efforts to address the silences and violence of the archive, we had sustained them because of the twin limitations of time and technical ability.</p>
<p>At the same time, we did not “stumble upon her in exorbitant circumstances that yield no picture of everyday life, no pathway to her thoughts, no glimpse of the vulnerability of her face or what looking at such a face might demand” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hartman2008"> [hartman2008] </a>. In fact, we encountered her — Venus, rural free and fugitive Black women, Mrs. Mason — because she made the decision to show up. The sum of Mrs. Mason’s collections — birth, death and church records, marriage certificates, property deeds, poetry, sewing baskets, photographs, a kerosene light, photos of the 1850 home built by the founder of the settlement in which she was born and raised — yield a picture of everyday life that no archive in the states of Indiana and Ohio, together, has been able to reveal<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mason2019a"> [mason2019a] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#mason2019b"> [mason2019b] </a>. Looking at her face and witnessing the choices she made about the information she wanted to share, demanded that we see her as evidence of the past and allow her to narrate her own story.</p>
<h2 id="longtown-online">Longtown Online</h2>
<p>This worry stayed with us after we returned home, and the remaining three of our five changes were driven by the ongoing realization that we would need to do more work to address the archive as a site of erasure. To that end, our third major change reoriented the web site around the idea of descendant voices, even down to the variable names. As we noted earlier, our pre-event Call for Contributions included a call to contribute voice in addition to object; on site, we stressed the importance of descendants’ preferences for digitizing the items that were significant to them — not to us or anyone else — as a way to emphasize the community’s archival power. To echo that emphasis, what would have been theCollectionsandItemsportion of another history harvest site is now called “Descendant History” In that section, we bring digitized objects together with descendant interviews and give both equal weight as part of the preservation efforts. We also addressed the divide betweencontributor,creator, andownerin the language of the original history harvest metadata, a holdover that assumes creation, ownership, and contribution have a transactional nature. These divided roles are gone, replaced bydescendantto acknowledge the inheritance that makes descendants like Mrs. Mason the guardians of their own history.</p>
<p>Fourth, the “Remembering Freedom” Facebook page created by Lori Archey, which is descendant-driven and will see more regular updates than the history harvest page, is embedded front-and-center on the history-harvest home page and on the page that documents the 2019 homecoming event<a class="footnote-ref" href="#archey2011"> [archey2011] </a>. Similarly, some of the photos that are part of the community’s own archive on Facebook are re-presented as part of the history harvest collection, clearly labeled and with additional links to the Facebook site and its preserved heirlooms. These embeddings and linkages highlight the active role Longtown and Greenville’s descendants have taken for years in their own ongoing preservation efforts. Just as Mrs. Goens’ particularity in person is matched digitally in how her history is told in the history harvest, the interweaving of Facebook and history harvest is a visible expression of the community’s own notions of preservation as a link between their past and their present.</p>

<p>A fifth change required more substantive effort as we considered the entwined issue of sustainability, affordability, and access in archive building and digital preservation. The community’s Facebook preservation efforts are robust, well-organized and literally well-liked in Facebook terms. Community organizers, however, acknowledge that the platform is less well suited to long-term permanence. The need for stability, combined with a low-cost solution that encourages community ownership of the archive, led us to GitHub. Most history harvests are built on a custom Omeka installation, a boutique university-built content-management system with built-in metadata processing that makes duplication in a university-sponsored repository easy. It does so at the cost of ongoing access to paid hosting with more complex requirements that require academic intervention; these requirements also make it more likely that academic ownership of the site would become the default. We instead opted for a simple, static, text-only site hosted using<a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>in Github Pages, a free platform whose primary function is shared, collaborative technical practices. This hosting choice also better supported the necessary metadata vocabulary changes that acknowledge the need to move away from colonizing ideals of creation, contribution, and ownership. While we are committed to partnering for whatever technical needs the Longtown/Greenville community identifies in the future, this platform choice is part of an overall design shift that offers the community full stewardship of their own preservation practices, including more history harvests in the future, with minimal computing needs<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gil2016"> [gil2016] </a>.</p>
<p>In the near future, we intend to engage more fully with one necessary feature of digital projects generally, and history harvests in particular: documentation. This effort has begun, but our long-term documentation efforts will be designed to offer a sustainable method for Longtown and Greenville’s communities to incorporate the history-harvest option as one of their own preservation efforts. We chose a well-documented Jekyll theme<a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mediumish">Medium-ish</a>on which to build our template, which gives future history-harvest preservationists a community of practitioners that is much larger than the IUB history harvest team<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sal2019"> [sal2019] </a>. Our own customization, including storage and naming convention for images and text, builds on the standards built into that existing structure, making it more likely that anyone with basic web skills can learn how to update and add to the site. Finally, we have begun the process of documenting our approach to customizing Medium-ish through a combination of in-person training,<a href="https://longtownhistory.github.io/documentation/">video tutorials</a>, and in-line commented code. In this way, too, we actively sought to subvert the supposed “clarity and simplicity” of code that obscures and excludes non-white voices and use it intentionally to support Longtown’s descendants as they voice their own preservation<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcpherson2012"> [mcpherson2012] </a>.</p>
<h2 id="let-she-who-has-watered-be-watered">Let She Who Has Watered Be Watered</h2>
<p>As we look forward into the future of the <em>Remembering Freedom</em> History Harvest, our thoughts turn to an emphasis on what the descendant community will need to guide their preservation and outreach efforts moving forward. That will take on several dimensions. As academic collaborators, we need to address not just the transfer of the accounts and passwords that provide access to Github and the email addresses that are used for Github logins. We also need to center the community’s Facebook practices as we work together to grow the site; new additions to the Facebook page that encourage community cohesion can go hand in hand with the stability of Github preservation. These endeavors should also situate a more formal university partnership, which should address backups and long-term file migration support for permanent preservation. In all of these formal partnership efforts, we will work with the community to emphasize a similar centering of descendant community needs that brings Black voices back into archival spaces without reifying the archive as the only legitimate site of preservation. To make this history harvest the site of true change, however, we need to consider one final step: a clear provision of outreach, time, tutorials and resources so that other communities can draw on this site for their own preservation work in the absence of the extractive patterns that are the hallmark oftraditionalacademic archives. Our hope is that this focus on community-based archival production and sustainability — using digital technologies and platforms that are easily adaptable for the creation of sustainable/equitable/democratized archives for the future — will continue to serve those whose lives and experiences have been left void by traditional archives.</p>

Sessions were held at the University of Sheffield, which had recently been the location of the popular British film <em>The Full Monty</em> . The movie had dramatized the plight of unemployed steel workers and their precarity under Thatcherism. Consequently, the conference seemed to me very disconnected from questions of class as well as those of race and ethnicity. In addition to being a very obviously white space in terms of who was in the room at any given moment, there was definitely a sense that the urban landscape outside needed to erased from the consciousness of participants in order to focus on the output of elite institutions and their scrupulous digital annotations of canonical texts.</p>
<p>At the time there was a strong emphasis on the preservation ofcultural heritagewithout a lot of reflection about whose heritage was being preserved and why, who would have access to it and how, and who would be curating and interpreting these objects of study in the future. I was very interested in the politics of digitization at the time and how nation-states were rhetorically positioning themselves with millennial enthusiasm as they launched ambitious initiatives for national digital libraries that promised universal access to rare materials connected to a country’s founding myths. I was doing a lot of field work interviewing librarians and visiting archives in the US, France, and the UK, but institutional administrators were very reluctant to let me chat with people actually sitting at digitization machines. I found the outsourcing of labor in this workflow to immigrants or workers in former colonial possessions particularly repugnant. There were oftenmistakesin which a Black or Brown person’s hand would be visible on a digitized page or the insertion of nonstandard language or classification would appear, and I wanted to know about these people and their stories.</p>
<p>In 2000 there was also growing recognition that there would need to be more standardization so that digital humanities projects could be more sustainable and interoperable. Many of the sessions at the Sheffield conference were about TEI, which seemed like a cutting-edge innovation, although it had apparently been around since the eighties. Publishers were also trying to capitalize on subscription database services. I vividly remember a rather clunky demo of JSTOR, which was still in its infancy, and there was also much discussion of Google Books. Yet, no one seemed to be talking about the politics of classification or the exclusionary practices of proprietary corporations, even though they were clearly part of the DH mythology that I was seeing being formalized firsthand.</p>
<p>These early experiences really drew me to seminal work in Black digital humanities that aired issues in the field that were clearly being suppressed. Regardless of their affiliation or status or chosen mode of publication (since blogs were important venues for Black DH), these were the first major critics in the field in my opinion. These were the voices that raised substantive questions about politics, access, participation, labor, prestige, corporate influence, the surveillance state, and the racist and colonial legacies of supposedly universal standards. By 2010, people like Anna Everett, Beth Coleman, Marisa Parham, and Kim Gallon were also asking fundamental questions about the definition of the digital humanities itself and the limitations of grounding its origin story in corpus linguistics rather than transmedia storytelling, collective world-building, digital activism, or civic media. When I teach seminars or workshops in the digital humanities, I see work by Black and Brown digital humanists as central, and I am perplexed by those who devalue this important corpus of scholarship as peripheral. Jessica Marie Johnson, Moya Bailey, Catherine Knight Steele, Angel David Nieves, Dorothy Kim, and Roopika Risam are always on my syllabi.</p>
<p>Although I would hope that international digital humanities organizations would do more to use their platforms as transnational, multilingual communities of scholarship to elevate Black DH, too often I hear nonsense that reinforces a falsequality vs. diversitybinary among decision makers. Moreover, too often committees and task forces composed of already overworked faculty of color are charged with changing the culture and infrastructure of DH organizations without the means for effecting the unfunded and unresourced mandates that they have been assigned. Having been around for two decades, I have seen multiple restagings of these supposedly good faith efforts. The cast of characters changes, but the problems remain.</p>
<p>Instead it might be more useful to invest energies in regional digital humanities organizations that treat access-oriented institutions and communities of color with more respect. For example, Ravynn Stringfield has argued that conferences like “Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black” and “Race, Memory, and the Digital Humanities” energize graduate students and other emerging scholars because they sustain networks of care and repair. These conferences in which most of the presenters are Black are also connected to particular geographies of shared practice and lived legacies of oppression rooted in space and place that must be addressed by Predominant White Institutions (PWIs).</p>
<p>Having taught in the Netherlands and having been part of research groups based in Norway and Germany, I don’t think that these place-based DH approaches should just be the domain of U.S. exceptionalism, even if American truth and reconciliation processes still need to acknowledge the continuing and lasting damage of mass incarceration, redlining, segregation, Jim Crow, and the Transatlantic slave trade in a matrix of material and digital relations. Digital humanities projects everywhere can make space for restorative justice that comes to terms with colonial institutions, racist immigration policies, and ethnic genocides by decentering White voices and opening up opportunities for true collaboration with initiatives led by Black and Brown scholars.</p>

<p>-June Jordan, From Sea to Shining Sea</p>
<h2 id="pomegranates89-cents-each">Pomegranates…89 cents each</h2>
<p>These are the words that close June Jordan’s poignant poem, “From Sea to Shining Sea” , published in 1983 in the the now seminal <em>Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology</em> edited by Barbara Smith. Following the rise of Ronald Reagan and his ascendence to the presidency in 1980 this poem is one of escape, incommensurability, and refusal in the face of an authoritarian shift, reductive politics, and the normalization of precarity. In short, this is a poem of survival beyond the regulating edges of possibility. The poem opens with a scene of economization and the regulation of everyday life.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Natural order is being restored.</p>
<p>Natural order means you take a pomegranate</p>
<p>that encapsulated plastic looking orb complete</p>
<p>with its little top a childproof cap that you can</p>
<p>neither twist nor turn</p>
<p>and you keep the pomegranate stacked inside a wobbly</p>
<p>pyramid composed by 103 additional pomegranates</p>
<p>next to a sign saying 89 cents</p>
<p>Each</p>
<p>Natural order is being restored</p>
<p>Natural order does not mean a pomegranate</p>
<p>split open to the seeds sucked by the tongue and lips</p>
<p>while teeth release the succulent sounds</p>
<p>of its voluptuous disintegration</p>
<p>The natural order is not about a good time</p>
<p>This is not a good time to be against</p>
<p>the natural order.</p>
<p>In this scene Jordan describes the quotidian spread of economic dispossession through newly liberated ﬁnancial markets that mark the Reagan administration and a stark shift towards neoliberal economic policy in the U.S. This rise corresponds to an increase in supply chain logistics, managerial monitoring, just in time production, deindustrialization, the contraction of public benefits, shifts in surplus state capacity, the financialization of the market, and builds the architecture for a global marketplace later inscribed through Free Trade Agreements<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gilmore2007"> [gilmore2007] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#harvey2007"> [harvey2007] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cowen2014"> [cowen2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#delara2018"> [delara2018] </a>. This attention to the exact number of pomegranates piled into a wobbly pyramid, the labeling of the price, the line break beforeEach,are intentional moves that draw our attention to what Murphy would call the economization of life. By this she means, “a historically speciﬁc regime of valuation hinged to the macrological ﬁgure of national economy. It names the practices that differentially value and govern life in terms of their ability to foster the macroeconomy of the nation-state, such as life’s ability to contribute to the gross domestic product (GDP ) of the nation. It is distinct from commodifying life or biocapital, or from the broader history of using quantiﬁcation to monetize practices” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#murphy2017"> [murphy2017] </a>.</p>
<p>In this passage Murphy is speaking to the ways in which life becomes valued by its ability to contribute to larger consolidated national and international markets. Additionally, she is pointing to the transposition of this valuation into a larger logic underpinned by quantiﬁcation, aggregation, scale, calculability, and monetization. Central to the functioning of this shift is an imposition of separability<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and the reification of the individual. The pomegranates are not sold in pairs or by the bunch but each. Each pomegranate is assigned an exact value as an individual. Returning to Jordan, she describes this transposition as natural order being restored”. As the poem continues, Jordan describes vividly the violences and repercussions of this restoration.</p>

<p>She uses the line, “This was not a good time to be a _________” , each time inserting a different subject position, as a device to show both the pervasiveness of who is affected as well as the sectarian divisions that rose in response. Jordan speaks to this tension in a 1981 interview with Adriane M. Livingston, Peter Merchant, and Mary Elsie Robertson stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really think that I know that Americans now are simply overwhelmed; like what is happening, what can we do. Everybody&rsquo;s tendency is understandably to try to take care of yourself; cover your back, make sure you have a house, a door for the key. I say that as understandable as that is, it seems to me that we cannot afford to divorce ourselves from what is happening in South Africa, for example, or for that matter, what is happening in West Germany, or Poland any more than the Reagan administration divides these issues. I think that the Reagan Administration and people in that; they see everything in global terms. From Brooklyn to Angola is not a big jump for them at all. I think that unless we, the people, begin to think in the same way, to make these connections, really on a visceral level, I feel for the survival of the species<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jordan1981"> [jordan1981] </a><br>
Jordan’s words resound today as an echo. At the time of this writing, we are currently entangled in cascading scenes of stark economic inequality, increasing climate crisis, mass global displacement, a rapidly growing global pandemic, and intensified state sanctioned and extra legal racial violence centered in xenophobia, anti-blackness, and cis-hetero patriarchy. While the edges<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> of this violence continues to expand — encircling those previously thought safe, hunkered behind thin walls of whiteness, denial, or entitlement, the scale of this precarity seems to be matched only by the consolidation of land, computing power, and capital. These hubristic endeavors seek to remap our social, educational, occupational, commercial, and sex lives. Such enhanced on-demand services are built upon massive computational infrastructures. Referring to this dramatic enclosure of vital aspects of our lives as the Screen New Deal, Naomi Klein describes the potential looming future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screensharedon a mediated platform. It’s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors, and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control) and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It’s a future that claims to be run onartificial intelligencebut is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centers, content moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants, and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyperexploitation. It’s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable, and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#klein2020"> [klein2020] </a>.<br>
Yet today, as was the case in 1980, is not a time of futility but of radical reimagining and visceral reconnection. In the closing of this poem Jordan returns to the pomegranate ﬁnally succumb to desire, voluptuously disintegrating. In the ﬁnal lines she writes that this is the only time to come together, “Fractious Kicking Spilling Burly Whirling Raucous Messy Free Exploding like the seeds of a natural disorder” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#jordan1981"> [jordan1981] </a>. Built on the longstanding rigorous work of Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Mariame Makaba, Joy James, Incite! Women of Color Against Violence, and Angela Davis amongst many many more, known and unknown, abolition has announced itself again within the popular imagination. Abolition is not simply decarceration, but the undoing of punishment and violence as responses to organized abandonment<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> within our society. Abolition then moves beyond just the removal (not mere defunding) of police and prisons and opens a capacious landscape of ways to live and be in relationships with each other that treat life as precious. Referring to radical abolition Gilmore states:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The abolition I speak of has roots in all radical movements for liberation and particularly in the Black Radical tradition. The abolition I speak of somehow, perhaps magically (meaning we don&rsquo;t yet know how, which is what magic is, what we don&rsquo;t know how to explain yet) - the abolition I speak of somehow, perhaps magically, resists division from class struggle and also refuses all the other kinds of power difference combinations that when fatally coupled, spark new drives for abolition. Abolition is a totality and it is ontological. It is the context and content of struggle, the site where culture recouples with the political; but it is not struggle&rsquo;s form. To have form, we have to organize.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gilmore2007"> [gilmore2007] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see the form of abolition organizing in the flourishing of public acts of rebellion, mutual aid projects, community accountability practices, transformative justice trainings, everyday people gathering to block evictions, calling in organizers, and hosting popular education workshops beyond the university. This organizing can also be seen in the connections made between surveillant technologies and carcerality. Increasingly, pressure is being placed on the ban of facial recognition technology<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> as well as big data itself<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> . Embedded in these calls is a politics of refusal. To refuse the grammar of the present order. To come together in all the ways that are sought to be exorcised, messy, spilling, and raucous. It is a call to entanglement, to fugitivity<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> , and to emancipation in the fullest sense of the word that is endlessly committed to life.</p>
<p>This essay takes up this call. It wrestles with our present moment, by which the old world is dying. This paper takes seriously the call that June Jordan makes and the emergence of a fugitive politics of refusal, so that the new world can be born.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> It takes aim at these competing worlds, one which writes the complexity of life as calculable units rendered as GDP, as productivity, as debt, within an ordered whole of insurmountably different pieces. The other begins with refusal of the present order of things. It embarks upon various inventions of flight finding the suturing ties that subtend “the beauty of black ordinary, the beauty that resides in and animates the determination to live free, the beauty that propels the experiments in living otherwise” (Hartman 46).</p>
<p>Possible but not eventual, the present offers a moment of clarity. It is the time to ask — Why does anti-blackness seem to perpetually overdetermine and saturate the operating system regardless of who is programming it? How do we begin to move to forms of critique and resistance that relinquish a certain focus on the apparatus<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> and begin to disassemble the episteme<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> , that seemingly transparent foe that perpetuates the endless production of violent techne<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> ? How might this make desirable the pursuits of situating computation elsewhere and towards a poethic<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> of endured proximity? How might such a proximity allow for the messy work of sharing risk together instead of the violent clarity of prediction?</p>
<p>What follows are the beginning sketches towards what I am calling Black Computational Thought. Built upon a long history of prior work,<a class="footnote-ref" href="#english1999"> [english1999] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#nakamura2012"> [nakamura2012] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#keeling2014"> [keeling2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#mckittrick2014"> [mckittrick2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2018"> [johnson2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#noble2018"> [noble2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#benjamin2020"> [benjamin2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2020"> [brock2020] </a>. Black Computational Thought engages Jessica Marie Johnson and Mark Anthony Neal’s call to “refute conceptions of the digital that remove Black diasporic people from engagement with technology, modernity, or the future” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2017"> [johnson2017] </a>. In doing so Black Computational Thought takes critical aim at the residues of Post-Enlightenment thought as it maps onto and subtends contemporary computational logics. Black Computational Thought denaturalizes these residues and situates them as spatial temporal onto-epistemologies<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> that are highly narrow and specific, rather than universal, axiomatic, or natural. Instead these residues are entangled with and are the basis for past and continued acts of subjection<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> , expropriation, extraction, and the totalizing violence of enclosing land and labor. By placing computation within such genealogical bounds, we are free to ask the question, what other proximal places might we look to to recover computational practices that challenge colonial logics of coercion? What other genres<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> lay in wait? Black Computational Thought holds open these proximal possibilities and directs our attention to the quotidian, social, opaque, woven, and fugitive practices of computation born from Black diasporic movement. Blackness here is always in an appositional love affair with queerness, transness, and feminist orientations of the world that fight the simplicity of calculated separability, and instead contend with their relationship to difference, kin, collectivity, risk, non-normativity, non-linearity, ambiguity, and trust.</p>
<p>I will work primarily from two points of departure. The first engages the scholarship of Black feminist + trans studies scholars as they speak through grammars of fugitivity into othered ways of being and sharing knowledge that disrupt the coherence of the enlightened Subject as individuated, rational, and self determining. I then extend these thoughts through a reading of the Freedom Quilts, a clandestine system of mapping escape routes for enslaved Black people, as a vital form of computation that forces us to rethink what computing can be when freed from its dependence on colonial pursuits of managing bodies, spaces, and resources.</p>
<h2 id="fugitive-repertoires">Fugitive Repertoires</h2>
<p>In the closing lines of From “Sea to Shining Sea,” June Jordan leaves her readers with a deceptively simple request — to come together. Jordan speaks of a coming together that is raucous, messy, whirling, spilling, and free. Coming together is an effusive act. It is a particular voluptuous disintegration. It is the pomegranate sucked by tongue and lips. This stands in sharp contrast with the wobbly, precariously stacked pyramid described in the opening. Pomegranates 89 cents each. The stark individualized metrics of value are succumb to a cacophonous spilling overflow. Coming together is an act of both encounter and attrition, finding each other to shed our individualized selves<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> . In Them Goon Rules: Fugitive Essays on Radical Black Feminism, Marquis Bey describes this coming together as “the critical intimacy we share with one another when we come together to pull things apart” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bey2019"> [bey2019] </a>. Bey describes this mode of being as fugitive. In this section I will engage Bey’s thoughts on Blackness, gender, and fugitivity as critical practices for enacting Jordan’s call to come together.</p>
<p>For Bey, fugitivity is primarily a praxis that makes real other ways of living together in the world. On this they state, “It is not necessarily a model or template; it is, in fact, deﬁant of these. It is a ﬂash, a glimmer, a ﬂicker that forces us to see and do differently. It engenders our doing something, not our being something; it engenders our moving with others on unruly grounds” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bey2019"> [bey2019] </a>. This is a crucial passage for thinking about the intimacy of relations that fugitivity can offer beyond the individual as the standard unit of measure. To engage in the necessary work of undoing together, means to live in the postures and folds of the fugitive as a perpetual state of becoming otherwise through actions taken together. Blackness holds that there is no reconciliation to be found in the individual Subject, that it cannot be taken for granted as the site of liberty. Blackness rememberers the original sin from which liberty was born, and frees us from unquestioningly returning to it. It then follows that Blackness exposes the limits at the end of justice, calls into question attempts at inclusion, dismantles the center from which the invitation of inclusion<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> is sent, and cracks the logics of categorical purity that even whiteness fails to uphold. Or as Bey would say, “&lsquo;Blackness&rsquo; names, gives discursive ﬂesh to, a critical existence, a disobedient world-working, an irruption upon the norm that crisisizes the scene so we can reimagine the terms and meanings of the world in which we live” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bey2019"> [bey2019] </a>. It Is important to stress that Blackness in this conception is born from the racial but doesn’t reside there. Blackness is a critical mode of being that struggles through the violences of modernity to foster other ways of being because it must. Fugitivity as the repertoire of Blackness reminds us of the price of admission, the cost of subjection. Blackness is carefully attuned to the residual, the left over, the over ﬂow that spills, through, and beyond subjective categorization and ﬁxed normality. It collects this excess in overlooked corners ﬁnding togetherness in the undoing, spreading into aberrant intimacies of how to be together in the vulnerability of non subjects. Blackness, as a way of being in relation, is in fact a natural disorder of voluptuous disintegration.</p>
<p>Many scholars across Black studies, trans studies, queer studies, and Black feminism<a class="footnote-ref" href="#spillers1987"> [spillers1987] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cohen1997"> [cohen1997] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ferguson2005"> [ferguson2005] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#weheliye2014"> [weheliye2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#snorton2017"> [snorton2017] </a>have emphasized the inherent queerness of Blackness and its fugitive resistance to hegemonic subject formations. This resistance to categorization extends to interrupt the projected stability of such attendant formations such as gender and sexuality. Race, gender, and sexuality are not mere categories additively summed, but are also relational practices that yield different social and political formulations. This is important as it contrasts sharply with mechanistic understandings of being by which identity is merely a summation of discrete inputs. Instead the scholars above emphasize the mutual constitution of race, gender, and sexuality as immanent processes, not destinations. For Bey this kind of fugitive relationship to gender opens the space for a particular kind of self determination. While self determination has held a long track record within Black political movement building and radical thought, Bey works to remove it from its more militant nationalistic trappings and instead positions it as a commitment to each others’ processes of becoming. On this Bey writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is a demand placed on us all to ensure that self-determinative spirit for others as well, to come at them with an utter, terrifying openness, presuming nothing, letting them show us as much or as little of themselves as they wish. This is how we form a different world worth living within: the radicality of all this movement work we’re doing rests in the ability to be fractured and critiqued by the forgotten, to give oneself, radically open, to the unknownness of the other, and to accept as a gift the various iterations of “Y’all need to get y’all act together<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bey2019"> [bey2019] </a><br>
This understanding of self determination that Bey offers cannot be held individually but is always a practice of relating to others while moving through unknown currents. Gender here is not something that can be presupposed or preﬁgured. This also begins to open the space for engaging gender as a non-proprietary relationship. Bey draws a relationship between one’s ability to determine their own gender and the openness of receiving that determination by another. This reﬂects some of Bey’s earlier points about the intimacy that fugitivity offers in coming undone together. In this fugitive space the assumption to know someone based on their temporal presentation is undermined. Such a practice of intimacy begins with compassion and humility to ask, return, and re-return. This leaves space for the ﬂuidity of gender while not eliding the ability to ﬁnd temporary homes in its folds. Coming undone is not a permanent place of residence. This is crucial as it doesn’t disavow the material ways in which we move through the world and the imposition of gender. Rather, at its best this fugitive gesture allows for a reﬂection of the power relations by which subject formations occur. This posture recognizes the power in normative gender formation as a particular performance and asks where power might be built elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thinking fugitivity in this way sets it apart from the enclosure of method, technique, or model and instead bears a strong resemblance to Diana Taylor’s work on repertoire. Rather than a static archive, repertoire “enacts embodied memory: performances, gestures, orality, movement, dance, singing — in short, all those acts usually thought of as ephemeral, nonreproducible knowledge” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#taylor2007"> [taylor2007] </a>. She goes on to state, “The repertoire requires presence: people participate in the production and reproduction of knowledge by being there, being a part of the transmission. As opposed to the supposedly stable objects in the archive, the actions that are the repertoire do not remain the same. The repertoire both keeps and transforms choreographies of meaning” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#taylor2007"> [taylor2007] </a>.</p>
<p>This focus on fugitivity as repertoire, as embodied knowledge, as gesture, and movement extends Bey’s fugivitity from being a critical response to subjection and raises questions about the ways in which such a radical undoing can also be a practice of information sharing and knowledge production. The repertoire requires presence as its mode of transmission. Through the presence of participants coming together again and again, knowledge is produced and reproduced. It is held in the fleshy extensions of those that share space on unruly grounds. In this context the transmission of information is not separate from the material embodiment of those involved. In fact it is dependent on material bodies in relation. The data is encoded and transmitted through acts taken together. It remains local.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> As a mode of information sharing and knowledge production the fugitive repertoire is encased in shared cultural practices made available through the intimacy of coming together. It is not interoperable or modular. Instead it requires something of you. To partake in the knowledge you must learn the choreography, the gestures, the furtive movements. The repertoire makes explicit endured agreements of trust, building practices of interdependence in order to share risk together<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> . Both Bey and Taylor stress the importance of presence and “being there” as vital components of engaging in unstable practices together. There is a productive redundancy here. The vectors that Bey and Taylor describe are circular<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> . They thrive on their ability to repeat and return — recursive, not linear. Such acts require endurance, an endurance capacious enough to meet uncertainty, an endurance that supports proximity without fixing boundaries. This makes self determination an act of coming together again and again to be undone while holding the intimacy of how we can be together in motion.</p>
<p>My engagements with fugitivity are an attempt to struggle with what it means to live in the theory of fugitivity. Rather than just theorizing on what it can promise, I am interested in how we can begin to recognize a fugitive praxis. In doing so I turn to Tina Campt’s seminal text, Listening to Images. Rather than speaking to fugitivity as a constant exhaustive physical act of movement and escape, Campt is interested in the quiet and quotidian. Campt works from this position toward a theory of fugitivity and situated understanding of the politics of refusal. Writing on this Campt states, “the quotidian must be understood as a practice rather than an act/ion. It is a practice honed by the dispossessed in the struggle to create possibility within the constraints of everyday life. For blacks in diaspora, both quiet and the quotidian are mobilized as everyday practices of refusal” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#campt2017"> [campt2017] </a>. Here Campt is quite clear that fugitivity cannot only be used as metaphor or merely an act of escape but is held in the ongoing practices of the dispossessed to survive in a world that isn’t ﬁt for their survival. These practices are found in sites of everyday life. This in part returns fugitivity to the body without entombing it, it is where ﬂight meets the ground, without landing, it is in the sweat that permeates pores, the exhaustion as breath leaves the lungs, the smell of fresh soil during midnight maurades. It is a fugitivity that is situated rather than ﬂattened, and made to spread so thinly that it is all encompassing and ambiguous.</p>
<p>Keeping with this focus on the mundane, Campt works through identiﬁcation photography as her primary material to think with. She theorizes these photographs has having a sonic quality that operates at a haptic level, only understood through feeling. Borrowing from Georges Perec, she refers to these photographs as “infra-ordinary, — everyday practices we don’t always notice and whose seeming insigniﬁcance requires excessive attention” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#campt2017"> [campt2017] </a>. These infra-ordinary practices and objects are moments of refusal that are essential for the possibilities of Black futurity. These practices themselves, as fugitive refusal, should not be understood simply as rebelliousness or revolt, but are born from an insistence to strive for futurity, to matter, to survive. Here is where the stakes and promise of fugitivity come into full view. When put in relationship to futurity, the fugitive cannot remain a romanticized ﬁgure freed from attachments, in constant pursuit of an ultimate unmediated freedom. Rather, the fugitive is one who contends deeply with the daily violences of life to be able to have a future beyond them.</p>
<p>Despite its complications, or perhaps because of them, fugitive praxes are important to break open the disciplining logics of rationality and separability. Fugitivity at its best is a repertoire that requires interdependence for care and regular maintenance. I am invested in practices of computation that emphasize such interdependencies while moving through the processes of sharing, storing, and making meaning together. Here, the social and the technical are explicitly intertwined rather than ignored or mechanistically separated. In what follows I hope to show how fugitivity opens computation to being a practice in the making, co-constituted through social repertoires and formations. It is not universal or standard but operates through specific genres. I believe it is within such genres that we might find social processes that make the space to return again and again while immersed in the practices of sharing information and risk together.</p>
<h2 id="black-computational-thought-as-endured-proximity">Black Computational Thought as Endured Proximity</h2>
<p>In this final section I will bring forth Bey’s subject come undone, Taylor’s repertoire, and Campt’s infra-ordinary to bear as I locate them within the Freedom Quilts as a future leaning computational past and a living body within Black Computational Thought. I frame this discussion through David Golumbia’s computationalism. In his text, The Cultural Logic of Computation, Golumbia makes a distinction between computers and computationalism. For him computationalism is “is the view that not just human minds are computers but that mind itself must be a computer — that our notion of intellect is, at bottom, identical with abstract computation, and that in discovering the principles of algorithmic computation via the Turing Machine human beings have, in fact, discovered the essence not just of human thought in practice but all thought in principle” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#golumbia2009"> [golumbia2009] </a>. Golumbia expands upon this term “as a commitment to the view that a great deal, perhaps all, of human and social experience can be explained via computational processes” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#golumbia2009"> [golumbia2009] </a>. Over the course of his text Golumbia tries to show the ways that the digital computer inherits much of its logic from a Post-Enlightenment high rationality. By engaging the work of Decartes, Hobbes, Kant, and Liebnitz, Golumbia positions this rationality; “computationalism entails not merely rationalism per se, but a particular species of rationalism with clear conceptual and historical weight, which we nevertheless seem all too ready to forget” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#golumbia2009"> [golumbia2009] </a>. The basis of Golumbia’s critique lies at the episteme from which computational logics emerge solidified in formal reason and syntax.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Golumbia is attempting to show the ways that computationalism understands cognition itself as an inherent computing process, and by extension, all matters of phenomena in the world can be understood as a function of computation. This eerily mirrors the Screen New Deal future that Klein details, by which the economization of life is aggregated, totalized, tracked, mined, and brokered. This world is imagined as an ordered whole made of distinct intrinsically different pieces that can only be understood through their secondary effects of measure<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> . This is the world that the economization of life emerges from and continues to validate. It is the world of big data, Amazon Web Services, financialized global economies, calculated abandonment, and Eric Schmidt. In this imagination of the world the Subject is the only self determining thing gifted with cognition and capable of measuring the rest of the world through modalities of difference and claims of universality. In short the Subject is granted interiority. Golumbia reminds us that this interiority is thought to operate upon the same mechanistic principles as a computing device, taking in cold empiric data and making assessments and measures through cognition. In fact this model often passes for objectivity and is upheld as an ethical principle within much of computer science. It is a principle based on separability, distance, and asociality. Accordingly to Golumbia “Interiority qua universal subjectivity emerges from numerical rationality applied as an understanding of human subjectivity, and not vice versa. This is not to reject the idea of subjectivity outside of rationalist modernity: it is rather to suggest that the particular and elaborated form of interiority we associate with present-day modernity underwrites an unexpected and radical mechanism” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#golumbia2009"> [golumbia2009] </a>. This radical mechanism and its assumed neutral evaluation sits at the center of much of modern representation and performances of objectivity ethics. Bringing these insights from Golumbia into conversation with Denise Ferreira da Silva, thisuniversalethic falls away is in fact embodied within white European signification. da Silva argues that, “in both cases, cultural difference sustains a moral discourse, which rests on the principle of separability. This principle considers the social as a whole constituted of formally separate parts. Each of these parts constitutes a social form, as well as geographically-historically separate units, and, as such, stands differentially before the ethical notion of humanity, which is identified with the particularities of white European collectives” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dasilva2007"> [dasilva2007] </a>.</p>
<p>Through the principle of separability which da Silva grounds in Kantian reason, the different pieces which are imagined as components of an ordered world are incommensurable with each other. Their relationship is one of unbridgeable difference and distance. The mechanism that Golumbia describes sits at the center of this ordered world and is inscribed in the moral project of the human, written as white, European, and male. Therefore the others of Europe can only be measured by their difference to white European humanity and are therefore subjected to partial protections through rights and partial violence. This undergirds one of da Silva’s primary questions, “How the racial combines with other social categories (gender, class, sexuality, culture, etc.) to produce modern subjects who can be excluded from (juridical) universality without unleashing an ethical crisis?” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#dasilva2007"> [dasilva2007] </a>. This also helps us begin to understand one of my own questions which opens this article, Why does anti-blackness seem to perpetually overdetermine and saturate the operating system regardless of who is programming it? Because of the ways in which the Subject is written simultaneously into white European embodiment as well as computationalist rationality, it will continue to carry anti-blackness in its bowels even in the face of the most strident claims of universality and objectivity. For this reason Black Computational Thought allows for speculation beyond the Subject as mechanism, computing as computationalism, and separability as ethics. To ground some of this speculation<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> I work through a reading of the Freedom Quilts as Black Computational Thought in practice. Though containing many formal computational aspects<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> , this reading of the Freedom Quilts is centered in computation as it works with Blackness to unsettle computationalism, objectivity, separability, and the Subject.</p>
<p>One of the primary tactics that informs the design and function of the Freedom Quilts is the use of everyday objects to circulate information within traditional African societies. Speaking on the power of everyday objects Tobin and Dobard state, “Communicating secrets using ordinary objects is very much a part of African culture, in which familiarity provides the perfect cover. Messages can be skillfully passed on through objects that are seen so often they become invisible. These objects are creative expressions of African artisans and give tangible form to the cultural and religious ideas of their kingdoms” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#tobin2000"> [tobin2000] </a>. Tobin and Dobard document this practice through the role of the griot as the guardian of culture and societal history. Based in oral traditions, the role of the griot was to remember and share ancestral lineage, customs, beliefs, histories, and legends from generation to generation. The griots “learned and taught via an oral tradition, based on memory, aided by the use of specially designed mnemonic devices. Encoded staffs, stools, memory boards, sculpture, and textiles chronicled the history of a people. But only the griots and the diviners were able to read them” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#tobin2000"> [tobin2000] </a>. This practice is one that continued into the new world as enslaved Africans held onto their cultural memories and combined them with others stolen from their lands to create new creolized semiotic systems that crafted convert ways for enslaved peoples to communication with each other, circulate knowledge, and build wholly different cultural systems within the diaspora. These creolized symbols were the basis for a visual language that gave new identities to those for whom culture had been stripped as they were subjugated into objects. Here the materiality and cultural legacies meet in the interface of the quilts themselves. Repertoire becomes the means through which knowledge is archived and materialized within cultural objects.</p>
<p>The quilt code which Tobin and Dobard uncover, includes ten primary patterns and a number of secondary patterns. Each pattern had two meanings, both to signal to those enslaved to prepare to escape and to give clues to indicate safe directions on the journey. Following these instructions enslaved people would know when to gather the tools they would need for the coming journey, the time to escape from the plantation, ways to navigate hundreds of miles to Cleveland (as a prominent location for continued travel to free destinations in the North), places to find fresh clothes and shelter, and practices for recognizing other confidants. This mnemonic device was used in addition to sampler quilts which held all ten primary patterns in sequence to aid in recognition while on the run. After leaving the plantation enslaved people would encounter quilts bearing single patterns left in public to air. These quilts became the constitutive matter that held together disparate subterranean connections. Because the circulation of information traveled widely and lacked centralization, the mnemonic devices used and patterns themselves changed often to insulate from outside parties learning and understanding the quilt code. For such a complex system to work it required a tremendous amount of labor, maintenance, and shared risk. This means that aside from the use of everyday objects, the making of shared diaspora cultures through the combining and mixing of cultural artifacts gave rise to fugitive formations themselves, in Bey’s sense of the word.</p>
<p>Here, computation is not an internal process housed in the Subject (in a vacuum of interiority) that sees and measures the exterior world as a series of different bodies upon which forces are acting. Instead the Freedom Quilts become a site in which Blackness is being written through the creolization of symbols, meanings, context, and codes that literally calculate pathways to fugitive escape and flight from the plantation. Programmability, in this context, complicates the temporality of code as executable function, as cause and effect. The Freedom Quilts generate a type of code that doesn’t execute automatically but makes the act of interpretation explicit. While encountering quilts left in public fugitives would discern the code and simultaneously have to read it in context, within the geography of placement. In this instance the executability of code is halted as a declarative axiomatic language imagined within syntax. Code is not an absolute instruction but is read in addition to landscape. Differing from the programming of second-order cybernetics, the landscape is not reintegrated into code, making it workable. Instead the limit of computation is held by the materiality of space, it is not transcended. Black people on the run would read the code with the landscape and continue on their journey. Computation in this instance does not need to be a totalizing logic that engulfs everything but lives alongside bodies in motion, in relation to geography, reading both simultaneously.</p>
<p>This relation between Black sojourners, geography, and the quilt code also extends to ancestral calculations.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> The creolized semiotics that become the patterns encoded with meaning and stitched into the quilts are reflections of knowledges and sense-making done by ancestors prior. The quilt code carries these knowledges into present function. In Campt’s formulation<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> certain ancestral calculations were what had to have been for the future-present to be lived now through fugitive acts of flight. The quilt code makes this connection clear, as these creolized semiotics were essential for cultural encryption and the protection of the code.</p>
<p>Computation here engages difference outside of separability.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> Black peoples before capture, from various geographic, historical, and cultural sites, are not fixed in their ultimate difference upon which the only mediation is found through measurement. Perhaps even more importantly the transparent center from which they are measured is not grounded in white European standards. Instead, Black people exchange and reconstitute their own situated knowledges into new systems of information and communication. This is difference without separability.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> This then opens computation to practices of endured proximity. By this I mean that the measurability of difference cannot be displaced and remade as intrinsic separation. That as we measure and collect data about the external world, we cannot continue to think of ourselves as transparent or incommensurable in our relationship to what is being indexed. Instead we must contend with our relationship to the index. Black Computational Thought grounds computational ethics in this practice of contention. It refuses imaginations of the world by which calculable measurement is the only relationship between things and pushes us to meaningfully engage difference as a relationship that we are entangled within. Only by doing this will contemporary flights of liberation be imaginable. In this formation, endured proximity supplants objectivity and separability as the moral ground upon which to stand when working on data ethics, bias, or algorithmic violence. Black Computational Thought attempts to open the space for othered social formations that work in excess of measurable, separable difference, and towards staying with the difficult work of proximity, trust, sociality, and risk.</p>
<p>One such formation resides in the quilting bees on plantations. Quilting bees were collective circles of primarily women that sat together and constructed quilts in collaboration. Because these quilts were often sourced from various spare pieces of fabric they were piecemealed and required numerous people to collect and plan each quilt. Quilting bees were sites that were both social and operated as convergences for vital stops along the plantation grapevine. Referencing James Oliver Horton’s work in <em>Free People of Color: Inside the African American Community</em> , Tobin and Dobard describe the plantation grapevine as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>interregional communication system existing between free blacks of the Northeast, the Midwest, and the South and enslaved Southern blacks. Horton chronicles how enslaved blacks and free blacks were able to meet at inns frequented by traveling plantation owners who were accompanied by black slaves acting as drivers and servants. He discusses how black sailors were able to exchange information with enslaved blacks at port cities; how slaves who were hired out to shops were able to gather information; how the black churches, even under the scrutiny of whites, acted aspost officesfor messages containing escape routes and instructions for escape and survival; and how plantation slaves hired out to work in a neighboring town served as dispatchers of these messages<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#tobin2000"> [tobin2000] </a><br>
As Tobin and Dobard document, sites such as quilting bees became gathering spaces through which communication between free Black people in the north, white abolitionists, and the enslaved took place across numerous plantations and regions were able to send messages and communicate. Again, because agency was assumed only within the Subject figured as white, propertied, and male, enslaved Black people that accompanied their masters were able to play covert roles as dispatchers of secret messages. Likewise, quilting bees were seen as docile innocuous gatherings associated with craft and feminized labor. Yet, it is exactly this infra-ordinary quality of Black quilt making and its capacity for agency that allows for resistance to take place in the open. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at quilting bees in this way also allows us to build on Tiffany Lethabo King’s understanding of fungibility, as it relates to computation. <em>In The Black Shoals: Offshore Formations of Black and Native Studies</em> , King states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a Black fleshy analytic, I argue, Black fungibility can denote and connote pure flux, process, and potential. To be rendered Black and fungible under conquest is to be rendered porous, undulating, fluttering, sensuous, and in a space and state at-the-edge and outside of normative configurations of sex, gender, sexuality, space, and time to stabilize and fix the human category. Black fungibility is an expression of the gratuitous violence of conquest and slavery whose repertoire has no limits or bounds. It operates both materially on the body and produces Blackness (as idea and symbol) as a discursive space of open possibility.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#king2019"> [king2019] </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ways that Blackness works in the diaspora to give rise to various gatherings blurs this line between the separability of things, echoing Moten’s definition of blackness as “a specific upheaval, an ongoing irruption that anarranges every line.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#moten2018"> [moten2018] </a>Because chattel slavery remakes the category of Blackness in the New World, formerly African peoples in part lost their connection to specific regional and tribal languages, customs, practices, and histories. This illustrates how various African people affected by chattel slavery became organized through various forms to mount resistance. Yet, the highly adapted systems of communication, cultural creolization, and trust that gave rise to the Freedom Quilts involved consistent forms of sociality and fungibility such as the quilting bees by which the piecemeal formation of the quilts as a vital interface parallels the makings of Blackness to form different possibilities on the edge of subjection. Quilting bees became important gatherings where enslaved people “were able to compile facts regarding geography, landmarks, places to avoid, obscure trails, mileage, and the locations of safe places where food and rest were waiting, many escaping slaves knew where to go and how to get there. Former runaways shared their own tactics and routes of escape. Most early escape attempts were individual efforts by slaves, not part of any organized cooperative ventures headed by Northern abolitionists.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#tobin2000"> [tobin2000] </a>In this way, Blackness became a constituting position through which computing systems were produced and are entangled with the materials, people, cultures, and places that enacted them.</p>
<p>Elsa Barkley Brown speaks brilliantly about the ways that material cultures carry alternate understandings for socially, economically, and politically ordering the world. Speaking specifically about Black women’s quilting practices she writes, “African-American quilters prefer the sporadic use of the same material in several squares when this material could have been used uniformly because they prefer variation to regularity…In other words, the symmetry in African-American quilts does not come from uniformity as it does in Euro-American quilts; rather, the symmetry comes through the diversity” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#brown1989"> [brown1989] </a>. Brown connects the errant quilting practices of Black women to other Black cultural forms such as jazz improvisation and polyrhythmic drumming. Both united through a considered practice of making structure through contrast and difference, Brown articulates theses forms as expressions of true democracy, “…for each person is allowed, in fact required, to be an individual, to go his/her own way, and yet to do so in concert with the group-to be an individual in the context of the community” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#brown1989"> [brown1989] </a>.</p>
<p>Here the digital is returned to the digit, to the hand, to haptics, textures, and textiles, to the process of making through material and proximal relations to each other, to making through endured engagements with difference. Brown’s reflections on Black women’s quilting practices carry aspects of Bey’s self-determinism as a repertoire for ways to share information and knowledge with each other through endured practices of risk taking.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to be clear: Black Computational Thought is not just a historic recovery of the fact that Black people have done some shit with numbers. It is an epistemic confrontation with the logics of computation situated elsewhere and challenges the very nature of what we consider computation to be and to have been. It is an argument for forms of computing embedded in technologies of living,<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> connected to care work, to fullness, to difference, and to shared practices of risky meaning making. Returning to Campt, this is not a matter of hope, but is one of tense. She describes this tense as, “humble, and strategic, subtle and discriminating. It is devious and exacting. It’s not always loud and demanding. It is frequently quiet and opportunistic, dogged and disruptive” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#campt2017"> [campt2017] </a>. In thinking about futurity as tense Campt offers what she calls, Black feminist futurity. Elaborating on this term she writes, “It strives for the tense of possibility that grammarians refer to as the future real conditional or that which will have had to happen. The grammar of black feminist futurity is a performance of a future that hasn’t yet happened but must….It is the power to imagine beyond current fact and to envision that which is not, but must be. It’s a politics of preﬁguration that involves living the future now — as imperative rather than subjunctive — as a striving for the future you want to see, right now, in the present” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#campt2017"> [campt2017] </a>. In her understanding of futurity there are no guarantees, there is no safety in eventuality, there is nothing promised to us. In the face of this, Black feminist futurity is one that must be made. It is an understanding of the future real conditional, of that which would have had to have happened for us to exist in the future. In this sense futurity is present work upheld by the daily practices of refusal. This makes clear the stakes of fugitive computational practice and the work of Black Computational Thought. It is not a site of salvation or assimilation but instead does the deep work of radical Black feminism, “grappling with precarity, while maintaining an active commitment to the everyday labor of creating an alternative future” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#campt2017"> [campt2017] </a>. I believe this is the call that closes June Jordan’s epic poem, written almost 37 years prior to Campt’s text, towards a natural disorder. My engagements with fugitive computation are indebted to understanding this natural disorder, this turn to ensuring a future through fugitive acts taken now. To move beyond the paralysis of precarity, preparing a new world in the face of extinction.</p>

<p>I evoke this term in the ways that Denise Ferreira da Silva mobilizes it from Kant. In “On Difference Without Separability” da Silva identifies separability as a key element of Kantian thought that still influences contemporary political and ethical projects.

<p>I use the term genre in reference to Sylvia Wynter’s work on the sociogenic principle as well as the ways that she takes up Aimee Cesaire’s call for a new science of the word. Wynter argues that humans are hybridly evolved as both bios and mythoi, meaning that our brains have evolved in a way by which language and the semiotics we use to describe ourselves carry meaning into scientific empiricism. Science then is never separate from the social, cultural, and political context articulated through language. For this reason Wynter describes humans as existing in different genres given the symbolic and cultural context of language. This challenges universal rationality. I aim to similarly challenge the universal assumptions that computation denotes, instead situating computing practices within specific social, cultural, and political contexts. For further reference see Wynter’s work in “Unsettling the Coloniality of Being/Power/Truth/Freedom” and “Toward the Sociogenic Principle: Fanon, Identity, the Puzzle of Conscious Experience, and What It Is Like to Be Black ” .&#160;<a href="#fnref:14" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Throughout this article I have spoken about risk multiple times. My interest in shared risk taking is to make clear alternate ways to respond to the violent utility that predictive analytics authorize. As prediction seeks to identify and control risk preemptively, it simultaneously reifies the Subject as a self determining being in conflict with exteriority. Violence becomes naturalized and justified as a requirement for maintaining the interiority of the Subject. This same logic undergirds predictive analytics and risk assessment models justifying violence as a way to meet perceived risk, read as non-white, poor, ungovernable, and irrational. In the book Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity During This Crisis (And the Next) Dean Spade writes, “Mutual aid can also generate boldness and a willingness to defy illegitimate authority. Taking risks with a group for a shared purpose can be a reparative experience when we have been trained to follow rules” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#spade2020"> [spade2020] </a>.

<p>Here it is important to address the scrutiny and criticism following Tobin and Dobard’s text <em>Hidden in Plain View: A Secret Story of Quilts and the Underground Railroad</em> . Since its publication it has been the primary reference detailing the use of the Freedom Quilts. It has also been a text engulfed in controversy. Much of this controversy comes from quilt historians such as Barbara Brackman who point to various gaps in the historic documentation to confirm Tobin and Dobard’s account. Brackman’s argument tends to highlight the dearth of corroborating oral history accounts of the quilts and discrepancies about the popular use and re-use of certain quilting patterns such as The Log Cabin. Rather than prove the use of the quilts in either Tobin and Dobard or Brackman’s accounts I find promise in Saidiya Hartman’s work struggling with the archive as both an index of violence and an incomplete accounting. In “Venus in Two Acts” Hartman offers a method of critical fabulation to operate beyond the empiric authority of the archive and its inability to render the lives of the enslaved beyond objects. On this she writes, “I have attempted to jeopardize the status of the event, to displace the received or authorized account, and to imagine what might have happened or might have been said or might have been done. By throwing into crisis “what happened when” and by exploiting the transparency of sources as fictions of history, I wanted to make visible the production of disposable lives (in the Atlantic slave trade and, as well, in the discipline of history), to describe the resistance of the object, if only by first imagining it, and to listen for the mutters and oaths and cries of the commodity” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hartman2008"> [hartman2008] </a>. It is in this manner that I am attempting to approach my work with the Freedom Quilts. While the exact mechanics of the use of the quilts is in contention, the practices of enslaved people to engage in exercises of trust building and information sharing along the plantation grapevine cannot be ignored. Neither can the means of plotting and calculating paths of escape from the plantation. I am actively choosing to engage these narratives in ways that ascribe fugitive agency to Black people even without properly proving the mechanics of their actions.&#160;<a href="#fnref:22" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

She writes that this rule of modularity was adopted by a nascent neoliberal state and used to discipline and quell radical calls for liberation.

<p>In an interview with <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em> , Issa Rae, the creator of the web series <em>The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</em> and the television show <em>Insecure</em> said: “So much of Issa&rsquo;s [the character on the show] journey has been about denying who she is, not being honest about her feelings, and just really being obviously insecure about so much of her life. So, a happy ending to me would just be Issa feeling happy and satisfied to give her <em>whole self to the world.</em> ” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#betancourt2020"> [betancourt2020] </a>. Rae’s retrospective and foreshadowing pontification about the upcoming fifth and final season of her hit series, <em>Insecure</em> , exemplifies the journey fans found themselves on alongside Rae and in community with each other on social media platforms. <em>Insecure</em> , created by Issa Rae for HBO in 2016, is a comedy/comedy-drama that chronicles a thirty-year-old, Black heterosexual woman who, at beginning of the series, is dissatisfied with her career and love life. The show explores dating, family, friendship, sex, career issues, and race throughIssa Deeas a character, which borrowed Rae’s first name as the protagonists’ name, and her best friend Molly’s relationship. <em>Insecure</em> is loosely based on one of Rae’s earliest YouTube produced web series, <em>The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</em> , that premiered in 2011. <em>The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</em> — also referenced in this article as <em>Awkward Black Girl</em> or <em>ABG</em> — features Issa acting as the characterJwith a similar premise. The protagonistJchronicles her career, friendships, and romantic life under the comedic guise of being awkward. Her awkwardness propels the comedy’s conflict and character development much like Issa’s insecurities does for <em>Insecure</em> &rsquo;s plot.</p>
<p>This article examines the online fandom of <em>Awkward Black Girl</em> and <em>Insecure</em> to explore the affective relationships Black people have to their fandom objects, their own intimate lives, the creator’s intention, and the digital fandom expressed on social media. Following in the footsteps of televisions shows from the 1990s and early 2000s, such as <em>Living Single</em> and <em>Girlfriends</em> , <em>Awkward Black Girl</em> and <em>Insecure</em> continued the comedic expression of Black intimacy and interiority by focusing on friendships, romantic partnerships, and family relationships. Rae’s foray into producing the web series on her own on YouTube and her usage of fan engagement to continue producing and prop up its popularity that eventually turned into the iteration of <em>Insecure</em> on HBO is a fascinating case study on digital creation, social media, and fandom that supports and propels shows into mainstream media.</p>
<p>I focus on the intimate relationships characters have with each other and those developed by fans in social media spaces. Black familial and relationship studies emphasize the ways Black Americans forefront their intimate relationships as a foundational tenet and an affective motivating factor to continue to fight oppressive systems. Scholars of a journal special issue on Black Love state “…what sustained black Americans was love — communal, familial, and carnal…” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#jelks2019"> [jelks2019] </a>. Amidst all the turmoil and triumphs, relationships have sustained Black communities. Combined with Black feminisms, my research develops the affective mode to interrogate how Black communities have sustained themselves. Specifically, Black feminism grounds my affective theoretical approach through womanism’s assertion of love as a central tenet. Womanism’s definition of love is “a woman who loves other women, sexually and/or nonsexually. Sometimes loves individual men, sexually and/or nonsexually. Committed to survival and wholeness of entire people, male and female” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#walker1983"> [walker1983] </a>. The emphasis on community, love, and sexuality within womanism’s description attends to how I am examining Black affect through intimacy and how Black communities have deep roots in love for self, others, and the community that continues in online spaces. It is the pursuit of wholeness as praxis — as sustaining and eventually thriving in Black communities’ personal lives. I assert that one way to trace this pursuit is in the active discussions about fandom. Fans have a specific understanding and relationship to their objects that center romantic, communal, and familial storylines. Rather than speculate and theorize about these processes through only examining the cultural productions themselves, we can turn to the words of fans as well as their reflections on the characters and their own lives as evidence of the affective struggles and triumphs in Black interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Fandom studies is the lens by which Black feminisms and digital studies combine in my research. Fandom scholars have traditionally centered the affective and intimate through demonstrating fandom as inherently participatory. The two definitions of fandom, affirmative and transformative, are central to how I am conceptualizing digital participation and fandom engagement as well as how the cultural productions are informing how their fans are analyzing their interpersonal lives. Affirmative fandom describes fans that like, or affirm, the productions they center their fandom on. Transformative is defined as taking the interest and creating a new work inspired by the fandom. Fandom scholars, especially fandom scholars of color have evolved and taken up this question&hellip; ” should be “Fandom scholars, especially fandom scholars of color, have evolved and taken up the definitions and arguments of the field in various ways. I intervene through combining both definitions into an amalgamation that states that Black fans demonstrate affirmative transformative fandom in digital spaces. Further, fans shared their insights about the characters and storylines and the overlap with their own lives through witnessing the pain, joy, growth, setbacks, stagnation, and transitions explored in both shows through character arcs and narrative choices. Rae’s usage of the YouTube as a new media platform fueled by fan engagement spurred the popularity of the television series where the characters showcased their whole selves, and fans responded enthusiastically on social media to Rae’s creation of complicated characters that struggle with their inner worlds and how it affects their relationships. Centering the community that Black digital fandom spaces create, I engage Black studies, digital humanities, and fan studies to examine connections fans make to Rae’s media output and their own interiority and intimate lives amongst each other using the comments on YouTube and hashtags on Twitter.</p>
<p>This article is driven by several interlocking questions: What does the digital fandom of the <em>Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</em> and <em>Insecure</em> reveal, complicate, and demonstrate about romance, friendship, and community? Further, how does the representation of these stories effect their fans interior lives? How does the expression of their interior lives on social media build community and challenge notions of hegemonic intimacy that is both expressed in the interpersonal sense and in online spaces? I posit that by examining interpersonal intimacy and interiority in cultural productions and digital fandoms, we see the demonstration of the pursuit of love, wholeness, and intimacy as labor that sustaining acts for and by Black communities. Within the quotidian acts of social media usage and the small moments of reflection they provoke, Black fans pursue much needed forms of rest and respite in these public communities and find ways to self-make to imagine a different world within their own relationships and interrogating processes taken to heal from generational trauma, patterns, and actions. Black fans contend with their familial and romantic lives through the expression and labor for themselves of simultaneous affective and transformative fandom in collective digital spaces. I examine how these interactions serve two capacities. First, they do the meaningful and important work of recovery and healing for Black fandom communities to examine how hegemonic narratives about the intimacies of friendship, family, and romantic relationships are reinscribed through popular media and are challenged in the storylines and expressive digital fandom. Secondly, pleasure and play in fandom communities continues to foster personhood, worldmaking, and reimagining for Black people in the face of the dehumanizing power structures that they navigate daily.</p>

<p>Intimate partnerships are an extension of where we encounter and negotiate our interior selves and how they are expressed outwardly. Thus, our digital selves are an extension of these intimate negotiations and are a site to examine how our hegemonic ideals about our interpersonal relationships are reinscribed, challenged, and co-created with others in a public domain. Affect and queer theorist Lauren Berlant’s theoretical framing of intimacy as an intersection of interpersonal relationships that reverberate publicly situates my framework on Black relationships, the digital, and fandom. Berlant’s definition of intimacy is “an aspiration for a narrative about something shared” and that “the inwardness of the intimate is met by a corresponding publicness” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#berlant1998"> [berlant1998] </a>. Berlant’s assertion is that institutions that were supposed to teach us “democratic publicness” — a la Habermas — evolved and were fostered into “collective experience (s)” like cinema and other entertainment forms where there is “the desire for entertainment taken for pleasure” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#berlant1998"> [berlant1998] </a>. Yet intimacy also operates outside of these institutional realms in everyday mundane practices — such as my argument of logging into social media — that reproduce, challenge, and produce the stories that hegemonic ideals encourage us to follow concerning our intimate lives. As Berlant asserts we impact each other in these public ways and thus, I theorize that it also effects our intimate lives directly: both interpersonally and with each other in public in online networks.</p>
<p>Further, utilizing Berlant’s “inwardness” , I turn to definitions from Black studies and Black feminist scholars of interiority to assist in forming my critical intervention about Black digital fandom practices. As <em>Awkward Black Girl</em> and <em>Insecure</em> center a Black female protagonist, I utilize Joan Morgan’s “politics of pleasure” that is invested in “ <em>black female interiority</em> ” as it is exemplified in the storylines and their fandoms<a class="footnote-ref" href="#morgan2015"> [morgan2015] </a>. Morgan frames pleasure in analyzing cultural texts through different interventions such as the advent of social media and digital discourse for the possibilities of expressing interiority. Morgan’s definition of interiority is “to excavate the broad range of feelings, desires, hearing, (erotic and otherwise) that were once deemed necessarily private by the politics of silence ” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#morgan2015"> [morgan2015] </a>. Morgan grounds her argument in Black feminist Evelynn Hammonds’ “politics of articulation” rather than the respectable “politics of silence” thus, black female interiority provides a framework to examine Black women’s sexualities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#morgan2015"> [morgan2015] </a>. <em>Awkward Black Girl</em> and <em>Insecure</em> do not shy away from this articulation of pleasure and sexuality as the characters routinely question and speculate about their desires and intimate partnerships whether they are familial, friendship, or romantic. Therefore, the usage of interiority in public digital spaces go together when discussing the plots of the cultural productions, fans engagement with them digitally, and specifically how they utilize them to explore their own interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Queer and Black feminist theories of intimacy and interiority lend itself seamlessly to Black digital practices as they center intimate ways of knowing and resistance as scholars have demonstrated. Jessica Marie Johnson provides an anecdote for my questions by asserting that Black people use the digital in ways that are liberatory and revelatory. Johnson argues</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that black digital practice is the interface by which black freedom struggles challenge reproduction of black death and commodification, countering the presumed neutrality of the digital. Black digital practice is the revelation that black subjects have …commodified themselves and digitized and mediated their own black freedom ideas, in order to hack their way into systems …thus living where they werenever meant to survive<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#johnson2018"> [johnson2018] </a>. Black fans are exemplary to the digital practice Johnson describes and that Andre Brock examines in, <em>Distributed Blackness: African American Cybercultures</em> . Brock outlines that “political-economic analyses foreclose the sensual, the erotic, or the deviant by arguing that they have no value in a rational worldview, but the denial of their exchange value does not negate their existence. How does one value love or anger?” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2020"> [brock2020] </a>. Instead, Brock argues for libidinal economy that focuses on Black lived experience online. Especially, because “another benefit is the acknowledgement and theorization of Black communal identity as a meaning-making strategy” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2020"> [brock2020] </a>. Black digital fandom is a meaning making strategy because it is also libidinal as it “offers a release from considerations of Black digital practice as labor or commodity” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#brock2020"> [brock2020] </a>. Black fandoms are labor, but a labor of love for Black communities in terms of navigating their interpersonal relationships. Through putting Brock in conversation with Berlant, I argue that the libidinal economy of Black digital practice is then inherently intimate. Black digital practices that are fandom based is entertainment taken for pleasure and thus “pleasure-knowledge creates problems for the notional rationality with which collective critical consciousness is supposed to proceed” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#berlant1998"> [berlant1998] </a>. We can return to these places as they are produced relationally and “produce something, though frequently not history in its ordinary memorable, or valorized sense, and not always something of positive value” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#berlant1998"> [berlant1998] </a>. Black digital fandom practices relationally produce hacking their way into their own systems and presenting their whole selves to the world in intimate ways through the analysis and expression of interiority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the field of fan studies, scholars often define two distinct modes of fandom production and engagement: the affirmative and transformative. In the introduction of the <em>Fan Studies Reader</em> , Karen Hellekson and Kristina Busse offer a definition of the difference between affirmative fandom and transformative fandom. They explain, “affirmative fans tend to collect, view, and play, to discuss, analyze, and critique. Transformative fans, however, take a creative step to make the worlds and characters their own, be it by telling stories, cosplaying the characters, creating artworks, or engaging in any of the many other forms active fan participation can take” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#busse2014"> [busse2014] </a>. Hellekson and Busse emphasize that many academics focus on the transformative creations of fandom as they are new creations and sites for identity formation. I argue that Black fans demonstrate an amalgamation of both affirmative and transformative fandom as defined by the field to morph and become <em>affirmative transformative</em> works of fandom expression. It is affirmative through casual engagement with fellow fans — or those that dislike the cultural productions or antifans — and content creators while also being transformative through the creativity of Black social media users and their identification with fandom objects. Black digital fandom reflects both. I argue for a simultaneous configuration of both because the ways representation, identity, and function operate for Black fans. Further, the communal aspects of fandom expressed comprise Black digital intimacies where affective interiority and transformative ideals through world making and affirming are enacted. Black fans affirm the cultural productions because of the representation they demonstrate but also transform them into something else through creative usage of hashtags, podcasts, and other modes of creative fandom. This also works interpersonally as the feel affirmed through the representations they see and express personal transformation as they encounter what they are seeing on screen and how it reflects interpersonally in their romantic, familial, and friend relationships.</p>
<p>Black fandom scholars account for the ways that fan studies has typically not considered Black fandom practices. Wanzo, in her critical essay about fan studies genealogies and citational practices calls for an “identity hermeneutics” which places Black fan consumption, critique, and affective fandom in the center of any approach to Fan Studies<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wanzo2015"> [wanzo2015] </a>. I continue in this tradition of building upon Black fan studies scholars and how the field has expanded its definitions of fan works. I am in conversation with scholars who discuss fandom and the intersection of Black digital humanities with scholarship from from Kristen Warner, Aymar Jean Christian &amp; Faithe Day, Sarah Florini, Ebony Elizabeth Thomas [2019], as well as many other scholars in the recent special issue of <em>Transformative Works and Cultures</em> on Fans of Color that was edited by andré carrington and Abigail De Kosnik<a class="footnote-ref" href="#warner2015"> [warner2015] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#day2017"> [day2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#florini2019"> [florini2019] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#thomas2019"> [thomas2019] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#carrington2019"> [carrington2019] </a>. The amalgamation demonstrates the ways Black fans digitally practice fandom in ways outside of the intended or widely adapted usage. Black fandom practice at times connotes a different relationship to fandom for several reasons. This is in part due to a dearth of representation and/or at times harmful stereotypical depictions of Black people in media. Fandoms of the Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl and Insecure are case studies for Black digital intimacies and affirmative transformative fandoms because of the dearth of Black representation at the time of their debut and the ways the show continued the comedic traditions of the Black shows that inspired Rae. Digital intimacy as a subfield borrows from heavily from Berlant<a class="footnote-ref" href="#rambukkana2020"> [rambukkana2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#berlant1998"> [berlant1998] </a>. I am examining how Black digital intimacies work through centering fandom. To support my analysis of Black fandom fully, I preface Black feminist thought, Black digital studies, and queer analysis of intimacy. Berlant centers marginalized identities that have had to create new ways of being intimate by emphasizing that they have, and we must “rethink intimacy” and to do so is “to appraise how we have been and how we live and how we might imagine lives that make more sense than the ones so many are living” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#berlant1998"> [berlant1998] </a>. Or as Stuart Hall asserts that Black popular culture is where “we discover and play with the identifications of ourselves, where we are imagined, where we are represented, not only to the audiences out there who do not get the message, but to ourselves for the first time” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hall1992"> [hall1992] </a>. Through digital fandom practices we can see how Black fans speculate, reimagine, and world-make about their lives through sharing themselves with the world in intimate digital spaces.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>I employ close reading to analyze the cultural productions and data I gathered from fans through YouTube and Twitter. I also use participant observation as a self-identified acafan, an academic who also has insider knowledge of their object of study because they are also a fan, and autoethnography as I account for my own affective reactions to the productions. I gathered social media posts from YouTube from the first episode of <em>The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</em> and I documented conversations in real time from select episodes of <em>Insecure</em> on Twitter.</p>
<p>As a Fan Studies and an internet scholar, I am invested in the communities I study, thus I aim to be ethical in how I utilize and engage data. To maintain ethical transparency comments that affirm fandom about the show where there doesn’t seem to be any identifying attributes or revealing intimate details about their lives, I decided to forgo permission seeking. For the fandom expressions that utilize more personal thought about their relationship to the fandom object, I ask for permission to use those fandom expressions. These issues have been debated by fandom scholars and digital humanities scholars and my personal decisions are led by an ethics of care and what revealing these intimate issues will bring to the forefront for those discussing information. I aim for an ethics that centers Moya Bailey’s self-reflexive observations when conducting online and digital research<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bailey2015"> [bailey2015] </a>. Bailey explores the networks Black trans women create through Twitter. Bailey employs a feminist tactic of informed consent to combat the paternalistic IRB process, while considering the types of harm surveillance and exposure can bring to their lives. As I study affective fandoms that center on their interpersonal lives and information it is important that I consider if fans wish to have their comments shared.</p>
<p>Further, the two platforms I utilize for this article, YouTube and Twitter, have different affordances and terms of use and privacy policies. That necessitates a different engagement with the data used for each platform. I utilize pseudonyms for the usernames on YouTube because the platform’s privacy policy requires it. YouTube’s Terms of Service states the following: “The following restrictions apply to your use of the Service. You are not allowed to: 3. collect or harvest any information that might identify a person (for example, usernames or faces), unless permitted by that person or allowed under section (3) above” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#youtube"> [youtube] </a>. Thus, in order to be in alignment with my ethical considerations and YouTube’s agreement, I utilize specific comments and code for usernames. YouTube is also under the umbrella of Google products where users must use their e-mails and that typically features a real name over a pseudo-name.</p>
<p>Ethically, in addition to seeking permission I use high profile Twitter users that I define with 5k or more followers instead of smaller accounts with more casual usage. As I am studying “Black Twitter” and the popularity of these cultural productions, I carefully choose and curate the comments I analyze, and more popular tweeters reflect the breadth of thoughts Black Twitter encapsulates due to their networks that produce high engagement. The users who have public tweets with a higher follower count expect to have a larger audience with their tweets circulating more heavily, especially with the usage of hashtags related to the popular cultural productions I am examining. Users with smaller accounts might understand Twitter’s platform affordance ofpublicly availablebut may not desire to have their tweets to circulate beyond an audience of 200 to 500 or less due to the small nature of their accounts. Further, I will not use pseudonyms for usernames on Twitter as the public nature of the authors I use are identifiable to those who are aware of Black Twitter — both social media users and researchers. I also will not use any tweets that identify confidential information as users are tweeting their responses to the cultural productions. Finally, the affordances of each platform inform my decisions. Twitter allows me to personally message users for permission as opposed to needing to add another comment to the public discourse to ask for permission from YouTube. YouTube’s commenting communities aren’t as conversational as Twitter as a primarily audio-visual platform versus Twitter’s primarily text-based platform.</p>
<p>While YouTube’s policy for publishing comments requires anonymity, Twitter does not require the same. Twitter user privacy policy states the following: “By publicly posting content, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including through our APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same…But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#twitter"> [twitter] </a>. I will utilize direct quotes and twitter usernames for the purposes of this research. In terms of confidentiality, I will abide by Twitter&rsquo;s rules for researchers that outlines usage of tweets that are public — not under private accounts — and have not been deleted, and I will abide by both rules even as I ask for permission.</p>
<h2 id="_awkward-black-girl_-and-_insecure_-fandom"><em>Awkward Black Girl</em> and <em>Insecure</em> Fandom</h2>
<p>I begin by emphasizing the behavior and character construction Rae develops in both the web series and television show as an example of interiority she heralds as an essential part to the popularity and thus success of the show that began on YouTube and propelled the producer/actor/writer to mainstream media and HBO. Specifically, Black digital fan expression of affirming and identifying with this iteration ofawkwardnessand theninsecureinteriority connote affirmative transformative fandoms through Black digital intimacies on social media platforms. Some examples of the interiority expressed in the shows include the main characterJnarrating parts of the show, or Issa — the character on <em>Insecure</em> — talking to herself in the mirror and her mirrored self, talking back to her. <em>Insecure</em> also includes many daydream flashbacks as aesthetic and to aid plot development for the 30-minute comedy. Fans responded to this expression of interiority with their own thus creating intimate digital spaces through affirmative transformative fandom expression.</p>
<h2 id="there-are-other-awkward-black-girls">There are Other Awkward Black Girls</h2>
<p>While interiority and intimacy can connote many different types of emotion and affect, I want to focus on pleasure as aforementioned by Morgan due to <em>Awkward Black Girl</em> ’s and <em>Insecure</em> comedic aesthetic, genre, and expression of a different representation of Black women that was lacking in the entertainment landscape at the time. Ariane Cruz analyses <em>ABG</em> before <em>Insecure’s</em> 2016 premiere. Cruz argues that Rae was successful in exploring Black female sexuality through her usage ofawkwardin relation to the character’s identity and specifically J’s sexuality. Cruz contends, “the epithet of awkward mediates performances of Black female racial and sexual authenticity on the show, unveiling the ways that black female sexuality becomes authenticated in and through its ontological failure and nonbelonging, however comic” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cruz2015"> [cruz2015] </a>. Cruz places <em>Awkward Black Girl</em> in relation to other dominant representations of heterosexual Black women in the media at the time. Rae represented a different take on Black women’s singleness and sexuality at the time by being awkward and not being awifea la <em>Basketball Wives</em> , <em>Love &amp; Hip Hop</em> [all on Vh1], and <em>The Realhousewives of Atlanta</em> [Bravo] as depicted in many of the popular reality TV shows that were in their infancy at the time<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cruz2015"> [cruz2015] </a>. Cruz analysis of Rae’s exploration of sexuality focuses on the plot’s themes and construction of the web series as other scholars such as Carmel Ohman and Yael Levy have done for <em>Insecure</em> concerning the same interior subject<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ohman2020"> [ohman2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#levy2020"> [levy2020] </a>. I argue that understanding the behavior mediation of awkward and insecurity that <em>ABG</em> and eventually <em>Insecure</em> underscores alongside the fandom provides another analysis of the work these shows are doing for Black fans. Studying the series plot and aesthetic choices paired with fandom engagement demonstrates how a breadth of expressed emotions are received by fans — we can learn what fans learn from and ultimately do with their fandoms.</p>
<p>Additionally, Rae took advantage of YouTube’s new media promise through their slogan “Broadcast Yourself” through passing some of the constraints and challenges that come from pursuing a greenlight from traditional media may have posed. Aymar Jean Christian’s book <em>Open TV: Innovation Beyond Hollywood and the Rise of Web Television</em> examines the ways in which web series become sites where producers and content creators can connect directly due to the digital nature of the comment section<a class="footnote-ref" href="#christian2018"> [christian2018] </a>. Christian’s argument is that web series allow for Black creators, who have been marginalized from the process of producing shows on mainstream television, to produce original content without the “single-story/cookie-cutter” narrative mainstream producers perpetuate. By examining the digital ways fans interact and reflect on their fandom object, specifically focusing on the interiority expressed, I trace how digital community intimacy is built and how fans reflect interact with their fandom objects. YouTube prefaces audio-visual consumption due to its platform affordances and the commentary and interaction happens after an episode airs unless it is a live streaming event as opposed to Twitter where one can tweet simultaneously. Therefore, comment sections often reflect affirmative fandom which is the fandom that discusses and analyzes<a class="footnote-ref" href="#busse2014"> [busse2014] </a>. Analyzing representation alongside platform affordances, Christian continues, “She (Issa) created an original representation and then experimented with distribution in ways that deviated from and continued a tradition beginning with BET. <em>Awkward Black Girl</em> proposes to represent its community of fans — primarily but not exclusively black women — in a way unseen on legacy television, and does so convincingly” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#christian2018"> [christian2018] </a>. The web series allowed for Rae to “push the boundaries of normative Black female representation” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#christian2018"> [christian2018] </a>. I argue that mainstream television has seen awkward Black girls in mainstream television before 2011. Characters such as Sinclair from <em>Living Single</em> , Lynn from <em>Girlfriends</em> , Kim Parker from <em>Moesha</em> and <em>The Parkers</em> can arguably be seen as source references for J’s character. However, to build upon Christian’s point, new media allowed Rae the opportunity to circumvent censorship of legacy media by expressing explicit sexuality, as Cruz analyses<a class="footnote-ref" href="#christian2018"> [christian2018] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#cruz2015"> [cruz2015] </a>. To reiterate, the awkward mediation adds another layer of interiority and thus identification with fans while YouTube provides a platform for fans to comment.</p>
<p>In the comment portion of <em>ABG</em> ’s first episode, “The Stop Sign” which was uploaded to YouTube on February 3, 2011, fans readily affirm the show and relate to Issa’s short pilot episode — only 3 minutes and 40 seconds — where she introduces us to her awkward relationships with her coworkers, ex-boyfriend, and ultimately herself. The episode introduces us to J’s world where she states that she is Black and awkward which are “the two worst things anyone can be” ”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#rae2011"> [rae2011] </a>. To sum the episode: J pretends to be in a music video when she’s by herself in the car, tries to avoid her co-worker at stop-signs as they both drive in their respective cars to work, shows a montage of her boyfriend breaking up with her, J’s subsequent sleeping with the co-worker she’s trying to avoid because of her heartbreak, and making up rap lyrics disparaging the ex-boyfriend as coping mechanisms. J narrates the episode with rhetorical questions to set up her awkward misadventures. J’s awkwardness and Rae’s scripting drew the audience in and resulted in fans affirming the series through their comments. As representation for a new audience in the landscape of Black media in the early 2010s, women identified with a representation that reflects their interiority and could express it to the creator and others on YouTube. Under the first episode, a commenting fan wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BAHAHAHAHAA my first time watching this [yes, I live under a rock] and I am soooo happy to find another &ldquo;awkward black girl&rdquo; like myself :,D don&rsquo;t feel so alone in this world happy dance I also shaved my head to change my life&rsquo;s scenery, loved a guy named &ldquo;D&rdquo; [big mistake __], and rap/sing while alone while trying SO hard not to have a nicki vibe XD lolz,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sigh">#sigh</a>what i&rsquo;m trying to say is: you&rsquo;re cool, and ima insta-fan :]<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#commentingABG2011"> [commentingABG2011] </a>. The fan affirms every aspect of J’s character in the episode relating to being another awkward Black girl. The fan also includes reference to Nicki Minaj, a rapper known for her sexually explicit lyrics and branding representation as J’s character raps an original song for the show about a rapper’s sexual exploits. The fan also shaved her head to “change” her “life’s scenery” , and made a “mistake” loving a guy named D like J did in the episode. These other interior expressions of the fans’ life are both affirmative of the show, while being transformative to her life personally due to her relationship with the show and being “happy to find another awkward black girl like myself” . By commenting her pleasure with the show, she is invoking an affirmative transformative work and Black digital intimacy through naming herself a fan for Rae and others to see. It is affirmative by praising the show but also transformative that she can relate to and laugh about her interior and interpersonal relationships in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally, fans also expressed desire for the show to remain small to insulate it from changes that can happen on a larger production stage. One commenting fans discusses this aspect specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the whole season, and I know this is selfish to say, but I don&rsquo;t want this show to be on TV, I want it to be my little secret, and plus if it was TV it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same, they would have to censor everything, but at the same time I would want this show to make a lot of money, they deserve it, good script<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#commentingABG2011"> [commentingABG2011] </a>. The fan affirms the series, recognizes the platform affordances, but also transformatively understands its impact on the industry, and to a certain extent, other fans through sharing. I also recognize this comment to express affective ownership of the show as they identified so closely and enjoyed the web series, while also wanting it to do well without losing authenticity. Black fans have had a contentious relationship to media forms regarding representation. Alfred L. Martin’s describes the political ways Black fans engage with their fandom objects. The four interlocking discourses Martin introduces are: must-see blackness, economic consumption, pedagogical properties, and understanding the machinations of the culture industries<a class="footnote-ref" href="#martin2019"> [martin2019] </a>. The comment about the show not being censored but desiring it to make a lot of money collapses three of Martin’s assertions: the move to television and the potential economic boost underscores fan understanding the precarity of Black media such that it becomes must-see by knowing that money talks to produce more representations of Black media. The comment also prescribes Martin’s fourth way that Black fans engage through pedagogical properties which are the ways Black fans examine “how fit fan objects are for learning and role modeling” or “what can be learned from a particular fan object” about how to move throughout the world as a Black person<a class="footnote-ref" href="#martin2019"> [martin2019] </a>. Relatedly, to Martin’s exploration of Black fans I assert that the pedagogical properties for Black fans where pleasure and interiority allow them to learn more about their own interpersonal lives through transformative affective fandoms. Simply, what can fans learn about themselves with each other and from these cultural productions to world-build their own romantic, familial, and friend relationships?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another fan that commented on the show supports this the pedagogical effects of learning about oneself after watching a trailer for <em>Insecure</em> on HBO in 2016 before its premiere. She claims,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just saw the trailer for her new HBO show and had to come back and reminisce. In high school, there was no show on television I could relate to. Then a friend told me about this show and I was hooked instantly. I&rsquo;m overjoyed Issa made the bold choice to share with the world her incredible talents. And, in doing that, she gave so many of us a show we could actually relate to and helped us realize we weren&rsquo;t the only awkward black girl out there. So proud of Issa. I can&rsquo;t wait for Insecure to air!<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#commentingABG2011"> [commentingABG2011] </a>. She has learned that she is essentially not alone in her understanding of herself as she was represented in media. Notably, the comments I’ve chosen and their specific refrain of relating to theawkwardis important as it created bonds both digitally and in their personal lives to the television show. They are learning from their interior lives that they are not alone in how they feel asawkward back girlseven with theirawkwardsexualities that aren’t mired in the types of sexualities that were circulating widely in the media at the time. The digital intimacy Rae fostered for her fans to explore and world-build through continued with <em>Insecure</em> . The popularity of the series garnered a built-in audience for <em>Insecure</em> to build upon and shifted to other social media platforms, namely, Twitter and Black Twitter specifically.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-real-ass-conversation">A Real Ass Conversation</h2>
<p>Once <em>Insecure</em> premiered on HBO, Rae could push the boundaries of sexual expression to become more explicit and kept the affective interior plot device of being centered on one behavior from awkward to insecure. Cruz later acknowledges in the <em>ABG</em> article concerns about the creative authenticity in the show as it transitioned in form and platform from YouTube to HBO<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cruz2015"> [cruz2015] </a>. Rae curated <em>ABG</em> alongside Tracy Oliver as independent creators with full creative control as they didn’t have to answer to television executives about the direction of the series. While Cruz’s concerns were valid as the platform changed, they were expanded in an innovative way through the insecure mediation and pushing the boundaries of storytelling due to HBO’s established credibility in television. Specifically, with the move to HBO, Rae certainly pushed the sexual, language, aesthetics, and content boundaries even further, which may be an affordance of HBO as a platform that regularly pursues characters with blatant and expressed sexuality. As an innovative story arc, Rae flipped the romantic aspects of the show by depicting the woman cheating on her boyfriend, which is typically represented as a man cheating on a woman when heterosexual storylines are depicted. The audience is also privy to how issues in her relationship also reverberated in other areas of her life, such as her career and friendships. <em>Insecure</em> ’s characters are educated 30-somethings that run in a tight circle with each other due to romantic, professional, and friendship connections in present day Los Angeles. As viewers, we can explore the main character’s motivations through the long arc of many of the ancillary characters and how they navigate their many insecurities with themselves, their relationships, and their careers.</p>
<p>One evening on Twitter resulted in a flurry of conversation as a major turning point in the plot of <em>Insecure</em> . The comments happened in response to a conversation between Lawrence, Issa’s ex, and his new romantic interest, Tasha, on the third episode of the second season “Hella Open” where she calls him out on his actions, which inevitably ends their connection. The first season chronicled how Issa and Lawrence’s relationship devolved from what appeared to be Lawrence’s retreat into himself after losing his job and subsequently the loss of intimacy in their relationship. Instead of ending it, Issa cheated, and Lawrence enters a reboundingfriends with benefitsrelationship with Tasha who he met at his bank. He told Tasha that he would return to help her with her family’s cookout and doesn’t return from leaving to drink with his new co-workers. Tasha calls out the ways his intentions, both in words and actions, don’t align and is evident when he attempts to apologize for his actions by citing that he wasn’t ready for a serious relationship. She calls out his lack of accountability by stating that he is “a fuck nigga…who is worse than fuck nigga. You a fuck nigga who thinks he’s a good dude.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#insecure2017"> [insecure2017] </a>. Lawrence’sgood guycredibility is questioned. I found myself engaging with the dialogue on my timeline as I follow many fans of the show and realized at this point that I wanted to study <em>Insecure</em> rather than remaining only a fan of the web series and at the time the new the show on HBO. The sympathy fans garnered for Lawrence being cheated on were placed under scrutiny because of his behavior with Tasha.</p>
<p>I follow the author of one fan that tweeted a long thread after that episode. In it, @peoplesoracle writes about her views on relationships that was spurred by Lawrence’s behavior. She did not use the #InsecureHBO hashtag to make her comments visible to the fans and Twitter users that might click on the hashtag. This could be due to not wanting to engage in the dialogue about the show that centers hegemonic representations of relationships as she instead pushes the boundaries of these constructions with her comments or wanting the thread to stay within the confines of her followers. Black digital intimacy and knowledge of the timeline topics assisted me in knowing that she was indeed discussing <em>Insecure</em> at the beginning of the thread without mentioning characters. The fan states that she wishes to “preach a sermon” — which is a nod to Black oration and church culture — and discusses her views about the scene. In a thread with over 30 tweets, she discusses accountability and relationships needing core values as well as for a relationship to change you with the desire to change for the better<a class="footnote-ref" href="#peoplesoracle2017"> [peoplesoracle2017] </a>. She expounds upon relationship requiring skills and that Lawrence’s lack of self-reflection meant that he did not possess those skills by stating: “If being a good guy or not one of those chicks means that you can get to stay exactly who you are, then you can stay exactly by yourself” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#peoplesoracle2017"> [peoplesoracle2017] </a>. At the end of the thread, she mentions how she wishes her future relationships to “aid me in becoming more in alignment with my core values” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#peoplesoracle2017"> [peoplesoracle2017] </a>. Bringing her thoughts back to Lawrence and reading areal lifesituation into Lawrence’s actions she states, “So many say they want that. But like Lawrence, they act shocked and appalled when it’s time to stand &amp; be accountable. He wasn’t sorry. tuh.” ”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#peoplesoracle2017"> [peoplesoracle2017] </a>. She then drops the proverbial mic by tweeting “Love = accountability/fin” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#peoplesoracle2017"> [peoplesoracle2017] </a>. This thread is an example of affirmative transformative fandom as she expresses her thoughts about the show, her thoughts about relationships, and refers to her own experience. Her tweets garnered a modest amount of engagement and several people responded with various affirmative memes to her comments about the show and relationships. Her interior life as expressed on Twitter exemplifies Black digital intimacies as others joined in by affirming her comments. It is also transformative as other fans possibly learned something new about themselves building upon Martin’s argument about the pedagogical aspects of Black fandom<a class="footnote-ref" href="#martin2019"> [martin2019] </a>. They could reflect about their own relationships thus constitute world-building, rethinking, and reimagining their own intimate lives. The original fan also stated that she was considering putting the thread on her blog, which is another iteration of Black digital intimacies where she can engage another audience. The thread is an example of self-making and the affective usage of digital platforms that Black DH brings to the discipline of Black Studies, Fan Studies, and Digital Humanities.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the fourth season Lawrence and Issa encounter each other enough through mutual friends and situations that keep them in each other’s orbits. They decided to meet up and have a conversation about the demise of their relationship as a way of closure. “ <em>Insecuri</em> tea” is an HBO sponsored podcast about <em>Insecure</em> by @crissles and @heyfranhey, two prominent podcast hosts with their own amassed followings due to their podcasts <em>The Read</em> and <em>The Friend Zone</em> , respectively. The recaps of the show are another place of intimacy where fans can immerse themselves further as a fan practice to produce self-making. By naming it “ <em>Insecuri</em> tea” , Rae signals that the podcast is a Black fan space to further explore the real world and fictional implications of the show.Spilling teais a Black American queer lexicon of providing the latest information and/or gossip about a person but has expanded to indicate a hot topic or other salacious information. Rae is directly marketing to her targeted audience, those who know Black idioms thus indicating that this show is for Black audiences.</p>
<p>As an example, the episode “Lowkey Happy” aired on the Sunday after heightened protests due to news circulating around George Floyd’s death which defined the Summer of 2020 worldwide amidst Covid-19 pandemic<a class="footnote-ref" href="#insecure2020"> [insecure2020] </a>. One of the hosts, @crissles, of “ <em>Insecuri</em> tea” primed the audience for the show’s distractive nature from the constant news cycle when she tweeted: “if you need a break from reality you should <em>definitely</em> tune in to Insecure tonight, trust me. #InsecureHOB #Insecuritea” ”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crissles2020"> [crissles2020] </a>. At the time of writing this article, the engagement on the tweet had 299 and over 1,300 likes as her followers anticipated her livetweeted thoughts about the show. A few minutes later during the episode, @crissles later commented about the dialogue on the show “a real ass conversation only happens when both people are ready to put down their ego and be vulnerable. #InsecureHBO #Insecuritea” ”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crissles2020"> [crissles2020] </a>. This tweet garnered over 3,300 retweets and over 8,600 likes as it centered the more mature characterization the fans were seeing in the development of the characters. While much of the conflict and drama in the series consisted of the characters acting out of their insecurity, fans anticipated this episode as they saw the reconciliation of the main characters through relationship closure and them ending the show by engaging in sex after their conversation. While retweets and likes do not necessarily signpost agreement, they do demonstrate popularity and engagement with the sentiment and discourse surrounding the show. As a popular podcaster and the official show’s podcaster @crissles is also asserting and advertising her insider positionality to promote the show, the podcast, and continue to create community around both by using the hashtags. While the first tweet about the nature of the show is not affirmative transformative fandom, it does connote Black digital intimacy. Temporally, the show acted as a reprieve from the news cycle for Black Twitter users who “come together as a family” — an oft repeated phrase — for livetweeting Black cultural productions.</p>
<p>Rae is aware of the effects of fandom and social media’s affordances and how it fosters fan engagement and growth from fans, thus fans can continue to engage with the content beyond the episodes. The podcast is corporately sponsored by HBO; however, the emphasis is on what the episode can do transformatively for audiences in the crisis of the protests and recognizing continuing police brutality. To that end @crissles realizes the cultural necessity of the moment and the digital intimacy that formed by Black Twitter users and fans of the show. The second tweet about the “real ass conversation” is affirmative transformative fandom in the same way @peoplesoracle’s thread is in that it is expressing commentary on a general observation about relationships<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crissles2020"> [crissles2020] </a>. Add in the specific analysis on the stagnation or growth of the characters interior lives while indicating hashtags to inform followers about the context of the tweets. It is affirmative in the sense that it supports the show&rsquo;s development and transformative in the way that one can reflect upon and think about their own egos and vulnerability when it comes to their interpersonal relationships. The interiority reflected upon is done publicly with other fans and we can learn a lot about the status of interpersonal relationships from these fandom exchanges as fans engage with each other.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By focusing on Black digital intimacies in Black Digital Humanities we can delve into the ways in which culture can assist in identity development beyond hegemonic representations and center the quotidian. Another aspect of my research, and other Black digital humanists, contend that Black life is not always about recovering and responding to the injury of white supremacy, but that the mundane and quotidian aspects of life, like social media usage, should be considered as well. This is a project of Black DH as Kim Gallon writes, “Black studies as a unique role to play in dismembering how we think about humanity and the digital humanities by extension. A black epistemology will generate questions about the relationship between the racialization of humanity and the digital as power, ultimately fostering new inquiries and deeper understandings about the human condition” ”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gallon2016"> [gallon2016] </a>. Through studying digital fandom, epistemologies of interiority as expressed in cultural productions and fueled by Black digital intimacies opens a world of understanding about the human condition. As evidenced by @crissles stating that watching the show would be a break from the world in 2020. In a <em>Cosmopolitan</em> article, Rae was asked about the intention of centering the mundane. The interviewer states “ <em>Insecure</em> also proves that it’s OK to just show the mundaneness of black lives — not everything needs to be about harrowing black suffering, which can be overwhelming” ”<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jerkins2017"> [jerkins2017] </a>. Rae replies, “It’s important to show the mundaneness because it shows us as human, and we don’t get to have those moments of celebrating ourselves. We have a very specific struggle even in the mundane, like with microaggressions. But that doesn’t mean the world stops. We still keep moving. We’re so trained to continue” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#jerkins2017"> [jerkins2017] </a>. Affirmative transformative usage of the digital and understanding of fandom practices centers how we continue and open ourselves up to the world to foster new connections online and in our personal lives. The small ways Black people experience joy and heal their intimate relationships drives my interest in this subject. I center Black intimacies because I believe by centering affect and how communities relate to each other and attempt to express joy, healing, forgiveness, and pleasure that the propensity for activism against oppression is strengthened. We go on.</p>

<p>This paper uses network theory and network analysis to propose a new approach to analyzing cross-dressing in Shakespearean drama, specifically the key questions driving much of the scholarship on that topic in recent decades: What kind of disruption to the social order did cross-dressing represent in Early Modern England, and what did it mean to shift that disruption from the street to the stage? We know that the laws and customs of the age emphasized clothing that matched the outward appearances of people to their places in the social order. A letter from John Chamberlain dated 1620 exhibits the Jacobean stakes of conventionally gendered dress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday the bishop of London called together all his clergie about this towne, and told them he had expresse commandment from the King to will them to inveigh vehemently against the insolencie of our women, and theyre wearing of brode brimed hats, pointed dublets, theyre haire cut short or shorne&hellip;the truth is the world is very much out of order.<br>
As Mary Beth Rose points out, the King’s commandment “amounted to a declaration of war,” and the results of that declaration revealed that “women in men’s clothing had assumed threatening enough proportions in the conservative mind to be singled out in a conscientious and thorough attempt to eliminate the style from social life” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#rose1988"> [rose1988] </a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conservatives of the time attempted, in other words, to enact the kind of restoration of propriety that Stephen Greenblatt perceives at the end of Shakespeare’s <em>Twelfth Night</em> , in which “[t]he sexes are sorted out, correctly paired, and dismissed to bliss — or will be as soon as Viola changes her clothes” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#greenblatt1988"> [greenblatt1988] </a>. Indeed, one way to view much of the cross-dressing in Early Modern drama is to see it as a fundamentally conservative set of practices. From this perspective, cross-dressing allows actors and their audiences the pleasure of seeing binary, hierarchical gender relationships troubled temporarily, and not too much. Jean E. Howard maintains that female cross-dressers retain their “properly feminine subjectivity” even while dressed as men<a class="footnote-ref" href="#howard1988"> [howard1988] </a>. The heroines are then comfortably restored to women’s status in a conception of gender that remains, in Greenblatt’s phrase, “teleologically male” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#greenblatt1988"> [greenblatt1988] </a>.</p>
<p>Other scholars emphasize the extent to which cross-dressing fundamentally troubled conventional gender roles, especially in a theatrical world that involved all-male acting companies. As Phyllis Rackin puts it, the “boy actress&rsquo;s body was male, while the character he portrayed was female. Thus inverting the offstage associations, stage illusion radically subverted the gender divisions of the Elizabethan world” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#rackin1987"> [rackin1987] </a>. Marjorie Garber has reinforced this sense of radical subversion in arguing that cross-dressing historically signaled a “category crisis” for the very concept of gender<a class="footnote-ref" href="#garber1997"> [garber1997] </a>. Rackin and Garber present a disruptive potential of cross-dressing analogous — in this narrow way — to what Judith Butler identifies in the later phenomenon of drag: “In the place of the law of heterosexual coherence, we see sex and gender denaturalized by means of a performance which avows their distinctness and dramatizes the cultural mechanism of their fabricated unity” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#butler1990"> [butler1990] </a>.</p>
<p>In the context of Renaissance drama, the perceptions of cross-dressing as fundamentally conservative or disruptive, as opposed as they seem, share a good deal of common ground. Both views see the potential disruption arising from all-male casting and the ways in which female characters cross boundaries while dressed as men, for example. Much of the disagreement arises from different assessments of the power of comic resolutions to contain that disruption. When the structure of comedy involves a movement from disruption to resolution, the difference between disruptive radicalism and reactionary essentialism can amount to a question of emphasis. Can the resolution contain the disruption? How much of the conventional hierarchy does a play restore when nominally female characters assume the clothing, legal status, and dispossessions of wives in patriarchal marriage?</p>
<p>This paper seeks, if not to break that impasse, at least to shift the terms of the conversation away from the linear placement of Early Modern theatrical cross-dressing on a scale from radical disruption to the conservative reinforcement of norms. Network analysis allows us to analyze how characters become gendered through a non-linear, non-hierarchical lattice of social relationships. As the characters interact and social relationships change, the individual’s gendered subjectivity also transforms. We find that cross-dressing protagonists propel themselves from isolated social worlds into a complex web of relationships through cross-dressing, and that entry into sociability follows predictable patterns. By following those patterns, the characters combine roles — the broker and the heroine — that are normally separate in Shakespearean comic plots, creating a hybrid type that becomes visible through network analysis.</p>

<h2 id="network-analysis-methods">Network Analysis Methods</h2>
<p>To perform our analysis, we generated network visualizations of each of Shakespeare’s plays including a crossdressing heroine using the Python library NetworkX. These visualizations, hosted at<a href="https://rnlp.net/shakespeare/">https://rnlp.net/shakespeare/</a>, depict the relationships among characters scene-by-scene, shown as networks of nodes with edges connecting them. Across the play’s scenes, each node represents a single character and the edges linking nodes represent verbal interactions between the characters. Edge length represents the frequency of interactions between characters; i.e., characters that speak more lines to each other more frequently have shorter edges between them. Node size corresponds to the number of lines spoken by a given character in the play or scene in question. This means that the more lines a character utters, the larger the radius of their respective node is. For example, if we were interested in analyzing the visualization for Hamlet, Act 1, Scene 5 (fig. X), we see there are four nodes, one each for Hamlet, Ghost, Horatio, and Marcellus. Hamlet and the Ghost’s nodes are considerably larger than Horatio or Marcellus’s because Hamlet and the Ghost speak far more lines than either of the other two characters in the scene. Edges connect those characters that speak to one another; i.e. Hamlet is linked to Ghost, Horatio, and Marcellus, because he speaks to all of them while Ghost is linked only to Hamlet because he speaks to Hamlet and only Hamlet.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We modeled our uses of NetworkX to measure and parse speaking relationships among Shakespeare characters after those expressed in<a href="#lee2017">Lee (2017)</a>. As such, rather than merely count exchanges between characters to create a simple character map, our visualizations include weighted relationships based on volume as well as frequency of speech — that is, we assign greater importance to longer utterances — ensuring a more comprehensive view of Shakespeare’s language than was typical before 2017. Building upon former methods, we also measured relationships using other social network analysis metrics to analyze our results<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wasserman1994"> [wasserman1994] </a>. These included comparative degree counts (the number of edges connected to each node), density (the overall ratio of edges to nodes), and clustering (the probability of two nodes being connected if they are both connected to a third node). We display these metrics as graphs where applicable throughout the paper.</p>
<p>Network visualizations have proven useful in many academic disciplines in recent years because they rearrange linear data in a two-dimensional space, foregrounding formerly latent connections as a visible structure. In literary studies and other areas of the humanities, where our data (usually language) is primarily observed one-dimensionally (through reading), it can be difficult to accurately observe trends and large scale relationships, let alone reenvision primary sources among so many other competing ideas in the academy. This is especially pertinent to scholars interested in analyzing source data in widely read and written about subdisciplines like Shakespeare Studies. It is our assertion that network visualizations are one way to engage with Shakespeare Studies and Queer Theory in an innovative way while also remaining true to the text.</p>
<p>In another sense, reading Shakespeare as a series of networks also serves to circumvent presupposed organizing forms among characters. Because our networks are spatially arranged by machine, these visualizations represent the relationships among characters based only on the amount and directionality of their language. This means that relationships in the network are independent of qualitative taxonomies like social hierarchy, marriage, friendship, or employment<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lee2017"> [lee2017] </a>. Instead, our networks prioritize actual acts of speech to define relationships, away from any occlusion from paratextual descriptions provided in the list of characters or the implications of a name. For example, in <em>As You Like It</em> , while Touchstone does appear as a relativetouchstonebetween characters in the networks, he is mathematically displayed as such neither because of his position as the fool, nor because of his apt name, but simply because of how much and to how many people he speaks. From there, we might enrich our reading of Touchstone with the qualitative facts of his character, but they do not inform the network at the generative end. This revisioning of Shakespeare’s plays as two-dimensional relative spaces based on direction and amount of speech was pivotal to our analysis because it shifts focus away from conventional organizing structures that we may take for granted and onto how characters actually function in the text itself.</p>
<p>While this project began with a general interest in the ways in which cross-dressed heroines are relationally positioned in Shakespeare’s gender-bending plays, our research did not initially start with a hypothesis or set of assumptions that we hoped to evidence with these network diagrams. Rather, we used the network visualizations as a way to perform exploratory data analysis of Shakespeare’s comedies in a different light. Ultimately, our findings confirmed to a certain extent existing understandings of the texts, as well as some conclusions drawn by other scholars interested in this area. We viewed such confirmation as valuable because it reinforced existing qualitative interpretations with a different mode of evidence gleaned from an independent method - network analysis rather than reading. Often however, as we will demonstrate in the following sections, our findings complicate, and at times challenge previous scholarly interpretations of Shakespeare’s comedies.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-within-the-social">Embedding within the Social</h2>
<p>Shakespeare’s comedies have been defined by “inversions of the norms of behavior,” which can temporarily provide “the exhilarating sense of freedom which transgression affords” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gay2002"> [gay2002] </a>. This line of reading relies on a definition of Bakhtin&rsquo;s carnivalesque from C.L. Barber, who famously posited that Shakespeare’s comedies hinged on a movement from release to clarification - from releasing vital energy normally “locked up in awe and respect,” to a “heightened awareness of the relation between man and nature” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#barber2011"> [barber2011] </a>. In Barber’s line of reading, the playful transgressions of the comedy unlock social energy by functioning as a sort of pressure valve.</p>
<p>Criticism on the comedies has more recently moved away from the binary poles of order and its inversion within the play’s plot, toward a more historically nuanced understanding of cross-dressing on the stage as a disruptive failure of gender representation. Specifically, Tracey Sedinger has suggested that cross-dressing on stage in the early modern context rejects a definition of sexuality in relation to embodiment or any object<a class="footnote-ref" href="#sedinger1997"> [sedinger1997] </a>. Rather, the logic of cross-dressing in the comedies is a sequence with a specific narrative temporality. Our analysis supports this interpretation of cross-dressing by Shakespeare’s characters as a generative sequence or process resituating the gendered subject within the play’s social network, as opposed to a transgression in relation to a normative social equilibrium. In our network analysis, the act of cross-dressing by female characters does not cut against the grain of the normative social structure so much as it reconfigures the contours of the structure itself.</p>
<p>Our network visualizations show that when female characters don men’s clothing, the social network constructed between characters changes. The individual characters are thrust into dynamic webs of interactions, but more generally we see the proliferation of dense and tightly clustered communities. Those communities allow the protagonists to meet a variety of characters and ultimately participate in a social world that is at once larger and more complex. Density, which measures how many interactions each character has with the other characters in the scene, increases significantly after the female protagonist cross-dresses. The simple bar graph in Figure 1 shows the typical jump in density of interactions once the protagonist cross-dresses.</p>

<p>Figure 2 visualizes the interactions in each play that create the tendencies summarized in Figure 1. In Figure 2, for each play, we visualize four scenes from each play, in chronological sequence. In each case, the first scene (shown at the top of the four-scene sequence) takes place before the moment of cross-dressing, and the other three afterwards. These are only selected scenes, but they illustrate the kinds of increasing density of social networks that create the overall effects captured in our analysis.</p>

<p>Looking at these patterns across the five plays, we see visual patterns emerging. The networks before cross-dressing are frequently structured like a barbell or a hub and spoke; the secondary characters are companions to the protagonists and do not interact with anyone but their masters and mistresses. That is, the networks cluster tightly around the major characters, who are isolated from one another. By contrast, when dressed as men, the female characters are able to join tightly bound networks in which many characters interact with each other. The high interconnectedness of these groups can also be measured by the clustering coefficient of these network, which increases in the plays after the female characters dress as men.</p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="" src=""
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw"

     ><figcaption>
        <p>Clustering of character interactions of cross-dressing heroines
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clustering can be explained with the following example: if Viola knows Olivia and Olivia knows Sir Toby, then the likelihood that Viola and Sir Toby also interact is high. These complex social circles expand to include characters of different classes and professions: Julia is captured by outlaws, Rosalind barters with a shepherd, Portia dresses as a doctor of law and orchestrates a court scene, and Imogen befriends both shepherds and Roman soldiers. Thus dressing as men allows these women to escape the confines of these dialogues and participate with a larger community. Through escaping their isolation the female characters are therefore embedded in the larger network and able to become participants in the social drama of the plays.</p>
<p>The exception to this trend is Rosalind from <em>As You Like It</em> , whose density and clustering measurements decrease after cross-dressing and assuming the guise of Ganymede. The playtext, however, gives us some indication of why this discrepancy occurs. Rosalind aggressively stretches the limits of her gender play as Ganymede, by staging a metatheatrical courtship scenario with the lovesick Orlando, in which Ganymede plays the role of Rosalind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would cure you if youwould but call me Rosalind and come every day tomy cote and woo me.<br>
(3.3.433-435)In effect, Rosalind performs a double move, by initially adopting the male role of Ganymede, and then by performing the role of his object of desire, Rosalind. This complex layering of Rosalind’s gender play based on her adoption of a female role when in male disguise, allows her to play with the gendered courtship behaviors shaping the encounters in the forest of Arden by switching between object, subject, and ultimately the end of the play, the mediator of desire. Rosalind’s oscillation between male and female identities may account for this specific play’s density and clustering measurements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These networks suggest that that all five of the cross-dressing protagonists experience a change in sociality: when they put on men’s clothing they are no longer limited to one-on-one dialogues, but instead enter into a dense and interwoven community that allows for the drama to unfold. King James I recognized these effects that cross-dressing could have on the larger society when he expressed his fear that cross-dressing would create a “world very much out of order.” However, Shakespeare paints a different picture of its influence: rather than creating chaos, cross-dressing transforms a sparse and isolated world into one that multiplies social interactions.</p>
<h2 id="brokerage-the-individual-within-the-network">Brokerage: The Individual within the Network</h2>
<p>Drawing on theory of corporate organizations, Richard Jean So and Hoyt Long argue for the importance of brokerage functions in networks: when a network has two subgroups divided by a gap, thebrokerfills the hole in the network and thereby enables connections among the other people who had been separated<a class="footnote-ref" href="#so2013"> [so2013] </a>. So and Long draw on the work of Ronald Burt, who writes, “A structural hole is a potentially valuable context for action, brokerage is the action of coordinating across the hole with bridges between people on opposite sides of the hole, and network entrepreneurs, or brokers, are the people who build the bridges” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#burt2005"> [burt2005] </a>. We find this concept of brokerage useful for describing the implications of our analysis. As the female protagonists move into the denser networks they inhabit while dressed as men, they enable the comic resolutions of their plays by connecting communities that begin the plays as separate social worlds.</p>
<p>On this point, the finding of the network analysis is intuitive and consistent with textual evidence from the plays. For example, in <em>As You Like It</em> , Rosalind leads Touchstone and Celia into the forest, where the group meets the shepherd Corin. Although Touchstone tries to assume the typical male role and parlay with the shepherd, Rosalind hushes him and then bargains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,And thou shalt have to pay for it of us<br>
(II. V.95-96)In this exchange, Rosalind orchestrates a business deal between Corin and the party orusthat Rosalind represents. Rosalind likewise manages Silvius and Phoebe’s relationship: “Cry the man mercy, love him&hellip;so take her to thee shepherd” (V.V.491). Here, Rosalind addresses one party, then the other, ultimately joining the couple together. In <em>Cymbeline</em> , Lucius entreats Imogen to speak for him: “I do bid thee beg my life, good lad” (V.V. 490). When she complies, Imogen acts as a bridge between Lucius and Cymbeline. Likewise, in <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em> , Julia acts as an ironic go-between to profess Proteus’ love to Silvia: “And now am I, unhappy messenger” (V.V. 116). And in <em>Twelfth Night</em> , Viola acts as a bridge between Orsino and Olivia: “All the occurrence of my fortune since/ Hath been between this lady and this lord” (V.I. 270-271). When the visual networks show that the cross-dressers are brokers, they therefore highlight a role that was already embedded in the text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The less intuitive aspect of this brokerage function lies in the brokers’ centrality to their respective plays. The broker is more typically a marginal figure whose importance lies in creating connections whose importance outweighs the broker’s own. As So and Long put it, “One’s eyes naturally focus upon the massive sun or smaller stars that occupy our network visualizations, yet somewhat less visible broker figures significantly populate the literary field” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#so2013"> [so2013] </a>. This model accurately describes the function of Shakespeare’s more typical brokers, such as Horatio and Gertrude in <em>Hamlet</em> , who do not cross-dress. As we can see Figure 4, the cross-dressers speak more and form more connections — measured by degrees, or the number of links to other nodes from each character — than do Gertrude and Horatio.</p>

<p>In this visualization, to compare the degrees and lines across plays, the numbers are represented as a percentage of the total degrees and lines of each play. Within a given play, we can use the unadjusted number of degrees to illustrate the connectedness of the characters relative to one another, as shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p>In the network of each play, the most connected characters have the smallest distances to other characters; put more technically, they minimize the sum of all distances to all other vertices. In the visualizations, therefore, the nodes of the most connected characters appear tightly clustered with the nodes of other characters.</p>
<p>We can take this line of thinking an important step further: not only do the cross-dressing characters combines the roles of heroine and broker, but in doing so, they also assume a dramatic centrality beyond that of their counterparts in other Shakespearean comedies. Compare the networks formed by cross-dressing heroines, for example, to the position of the main female characters in two late scenes from comedies without cross-dressing characters, <em>Taming of the Shrew</em> and <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> .</p>

<p>In both of these networks, non-cross-dressing female characters (Katharina, Bianca, Helena, Hermia, and Hippolyta) occupy positions at the margins of the networks. Cross-dressing female protagonists consistently gain a central position in the social networks involved in the final moves of the plays. Female characters who retain conventional dress and gender conventions, on the contrary, occupy a marginal social position during crucial scenes of narrative resolution.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-network-structure-and-gender">Implications for Network Structure and Gender</h2>
<p>Considering a cross-dressed heroine in terms of networked sociability helps us see that character’s gender in terms of relation as well as identity: the cross-dressing not only allows a character initially gendered female to act like a man, so to speak, but it also allows her to connect like a man. The social worlds of all of these plays are male-dominated, in that characters of all genders speak primarily in response to men, but we find, in the data as well as intuitively, that male characters respond to men more than female characters do, reflecting the plays’ tendency to incorporate same-gender and well as mixed-gender conversations. The cross-dressed heroines, however, respond to male characters even more than other male characters do. As Figure 8 illustrates, when wearing men’s clothing, the heroines inhabit the social relations of men (or even statistical super-men), even to the point of leaving behind the conversational connections to other women that have previously defined their relationships.</p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="" src=""

</figure>
<p>These visualizations share a common assumption: that gender in the plays arises initially from the categorizations that the text offers us and, subsequently but crucially, from the nature of the characters’ interactions. In this latter aspect, gender is fundamentally relational. In a more conventional linear model of gender, masculinity and femininity constitute two poles, and the focus of analysis is an individual character using cross-dressing to traverse the distance between those poles. Rather than investigating the gender identity of isolated characters — no matter how complex those identities may be — our approach instead describes the social relations within dynamic systems that produce the performed effects of gender in the plays.</p>
<p>The grounding of our approach in textual rather than contextual data creates our focus on the carnivalesque effects of cross-dressing within the action of the plays. We do not mean, however, to minimize the importance of other approaches: for instance, Rackin’s helpful insistence on the gendering of the actors in all-male performances of the plays implies another kind of network visualization, showing every interaction as a male actor (in both senses) speaking exclusively to other male actors, with our conception of mixed-gender networks operating in ironic tension with that all-male theatrical world. And that is not to mention yet another layer of complication: that themaleactors of those companies may also have experienced their gender as relational or non-binary, thus implying in their irrecoverable subjectivities <em>another</em> kind of multiply gendered network functioning in any given performance.</p>
<p>In closing, we step back from the landscape of nodes and edges to consider the implications of our analysis for reading passages of these plays in light of a networked conception of gender. Jean Howard has made the case that the cross-dressing heroines fail to disrupt gender relations fundamentally because the cross-dressing women are reabsorbed into the conventional social world by the end of of the plays. Howard argues that in the conclusion of <em>Twelfth Night</em> , for instance, “real threats are removed and both difference and gender hierarchy reinscribe” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#howard1988"> [howard1988] </a>. While Howard concedes that <em>As You Like It</em>  “shows a woman manipulating [gender] representations in her own interest,” Howard still maintains that the play ultimately has the “primary effect&hellip;of confirming the gender system” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#howard1988"> [howard1988] </a>. However, in the midst of her argument, Howard does note that this recuperation of the gendered subject in the social world “is never perfectly achieved” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#howard1988"> [howard1988] </a>.</p>
<p>Howard’s reading persuasively accounts for the conservative movement of these comic plots as well as the disruptive and incompletely contained undercurrents that cross-dressing creates. We perceive another reading that moves away from the conservative/radical opposition at the heart of that reading. In <em>Twelfth Night</em> , Viola initially voices her desire to escape the bounds of society and create her own agency:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O, that I served that lady,And might not be delivered to the worldTill I had made mine own occasion.<br>
(I. II. 43-45)Here, Viola eschews typical feminine passivity and fantasizes that she will enter the social world once she has “made” her own place within it. Viola’s efforts, however, lead her not to independence but entanglement, as with the lives of Orsino and Olivia:<br>
O Time, thou must untangle this, not I.It is too hard a knot for me t’ untie.<br>
(II.III.40-41)In this moment, Viola states that she cannot individually control theknotof society, even though she may shape it through her decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viola thereafter voices a new understanding of her agency that is contingent on her social circumstances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not embrace me till each circumstanceOf place, time, fortune, do cohere and jumpThat I am Viola;<br>
(V.I.263-265)Here, Viola recognizes that she cannot entirely “make her own occasion.” Even her most fundamental statement of named identity, “I am Viola,” becomes a dependent clause that is shaped by the space she inhabits, namely, theplaceas well as thetimeandfortuneof her circumstances. Furthermore, all of those contingencies build on the fundamental irony of acting, that the pleasure of watching the play involves understanding that, in voice and body, Viola is not Viola at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We propose that network analysis allows new and complementary understandings of the kinds of identity and contingency, being and relationship, that enable performed gender to make, and be made by, its own occasions. Our visualization of these Shakespearean networks illustrates cross-dressing not as an individual character’s movement a simple spectrum of more or less disruptive gender performance, but rather as an act of social reconfiguration made more visible by visualization methods such as social network analysis. By cross-dressing, the heroine moves to the center of a complex social world and brokers its transformations during the part of the play in which she dresses as a man. Even after she changes back into a woman’s clothing, in a seemingly dismaying regression back to the governing social norms that James I’scommandantsought to preserve, the play’s resolution comes about subtly in response to her more fundamental remaking of its networked communities.</p>

<p>Structured data in graphical formats present certain challenges for computational systems rooted in language (Semantic Web) and metrics (quantitative data); and yet, many forms of information are expressed in graphical form as instantiations of ontologies that originate from specific cultural values and points of view. The history of graphic expressions for time-keeping stretches from early tallies of the phases of the moon to current automated systems for tracking temporal phenomena at nano-to-macro scales; these temporal records often serve practical purposes, but they also encode belief systems. This is reflected in the sequential cycles of the MayanLong Countcalendar and the Judeo-Christian tradition of dividing time into periodsbeforeandafterthe birth of Christ. In Western culture, Biblical chronologies dominated representations of human history until the advent ofdeep time,which was introduced by James Hutton and others in the late 18th century as part of the emerging science of geology. Hutton inherited a time scale that had been in place from late antiquity, codified through such widely-used references as the work of Bishop James Ussher. In his radical extension of time’s scale, Hutton altered the ideological as well as metrical frameworks for historical understanding. The graphical formats in which these schemes are expressed are structured data, but do not readily lend themselves to direct processing by computational means.</p>
<p>For research that acknowledges these historical shifts in understanding and representing time, identifying which chronologies adhere to a scientific understanding of time is not the main concern. Every graphical expression of a chronological scheme is historical evidence of a descriptive system, which is useful to scholarship concerned with how time has been conceived in particular historical contexts. Though geology requires a different chronological framework than that of Dakota Winter Counts or early Roman calendar systems, each of these schemes expresses culturally specific understandings and epistemologies of chronology which demonstrate unique approaches to accounting for chronological events. Respect for the specificity of these schemes and for the cultural otherness of diverse past and present viewpoints is essential for the study of human knowledge in its multiplicity of forms. However, it is not trivial to translate this respect for ontological difference into sense-making and analytic tools.</p>
<p>With this respect for specificity, and its computational representation as a guiding concern, the Heterochronologies project puts forth a few fundamental notions. First, it proposes to treat graphical representations of time as structured data that can be made tractable, analyzed, and used comparatively in a digital environment; this is a humanist project that requires innovative digital intervention. Second, it supports the systematic analysis of disparate chronologies with an attention to their unique cultural differences. Indeed, this project was motivated by the conviction that different chronologies should be studied without subsuming them into a single standard or framework. In this regard, it is a project in dialogue with Linked Data initiatives that specify crosswalks into a uniform standard as a way to make data interoperable. The logical and procedural standardizations established by the Linked Data model — RDF standards for structures, domain ontologies for semantics, and vocabularies for authority control — lose sight of the specificity and cultural contexts of the originating data models by requiring the approximated translation of existing semantic structures into prescribed ones. We believe an ethical issue is raised by this translation and its subtle but actual assertion of a hegemonic approach.</p>
<p>A key functionality that inspired the Heterochronologies design, and which allows it to enable interoperability while avoiding translation, is the ability to specifyfloating correlations, or discrete relationships between points in different schemes of representation that enable them to be compared. The idea of afloating correlationis that specific points in differently structured schemes can be linked without requiring that the systems share a structure or metric. The single point of correlation allows the rest of the scheme to ‘float’ with its own extension. For example, depictions of the Leonid Meteor Showers of 1833 appear in multiple chronological record keeping systems, each of which is constructed according to its own time scale, with distinct start and end points, and different valuations of the event. The relative position of the Showers in each chronological system can be specified as a floating correlation, and thereby compared across systems, each as its own cultural expression of time. A key benefit of this approach is that it enables the comparison of chronologies relative to an event depicted in each, rather than to a unifying scheme of representation; relationality is allowed to emerge from the data, rather than as a consequence of the establishment of an <em>a priori,</em> unifying scheme which inevitably imposes cultural connotations and biases. For example, Egyptian dynastic periodization can be matched with geological events and Olympiads without all of these needing to be expressed in the Gregorian calendar, and the Winter Counts do not have to take the birth of Christ as the start point for their reference frame.</p>
<p>The aforementioned notions have been operationalized through several activities, or goals, in the Heterochronologies project. The first is by studying chronological systems in their graphical expression to understand how they periodize, value, mark, and represent historical time; in other words, the first activity is to study the graphical structure of these chronologies as intellectual objects. The second is using this study as an exercise in comparative ontologies within their original formulation; the point of this is to make ontologies <em>legible</em> as ideological documents that can be <em>read</em> as value-producing systems. This goal is bound to a third, which is using graphical methods of analysis as research tools — analyzing formal, schematic, and visual representations of ontologies as the basis of systematic inquiry into their characteristics. The final goal is to provide a digital platform for organizing chronological information for research or pedagogical purposes. Such a software environment supports the analysis of chronological systems and their graphical forms, including how they periodize, value, mark, and represent historical time. This goal resulted in the development of a prototype for a Time Capsule work environment that includes a Collection of examples and a Chrono-Referencing system for organizing floating correlations in a digital platform.</p>
<p>Overall, the unique contribution of the Heterochronologies project has to do with the methodological approach through which it treats visual representations of time as structured data that may be serialized in a JSON data structure to enable cross-case comparison without requiring the subsumption of the various logical and semantic elements that compose such representations into a hegemonic system. In other words, this project allows correlation of data that is expressed graphically by chronologies — historic, contemporary, existing, and not yet created — while preserving the specific characteristics of their originating contexts of production. In this sense, though this project is focused on chronologies, the methodological approach and analysis are meant to be extensible to other kinds of ontologies. While we developed this project and the tool in which it culminates with the general public in mind, its scope is to support any and all research projects that make visual temporal representations their object. Academic researchers, librarians, teachers, students, and lay persons are all potential users of the Time Capsule tool we present in this paper.</p>
<h2 id="approach-and-requirements">Approach and Requirements</h2>
<h2 id="epistemological-considerations">Epistemological Considerations</h2>
<p>Certain theoretical tenets inform the design of comparative tools and methods that this project aims to support. First, the value expressed by graphical representations of time — i.e., timelines and chronologies — is a function of the relationship between <em>frames</em> and <em>elements</em> within them<a class="footnote-ref" href="#drucker2009"> [drucker2009] </a>. A frame is a defining boundary – graphical or conceptual – which can establish a unifying scheme of reference or an epistemological context that supports an arrangement of elements a) in relation to one another; and b) in accordance with certain logical rules and semantic conventions. Elements arranged in relation to a frame express underlying data structures and values, enabling them to <em>provoke sense-making</em> according to ontological and epistemological regulations that they enact.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>For the purposes of this project, we regard frame and elements as formally distinct types of objects serving interdependent roles that can be represented computationally. Following the premise that graphical elements are involved in part-to-whole and part-to-part relations, and that their meaning is instantiated by those relations, any part considered for analysis should also be analyzed in relation to other parts and wholes that inform its significance. Furthermore, the formal distinction between frame and elements should be respected by and reflected in the digital environment to enable comparison, including the operations supported by the system as well as the underlying computational aspects at both logical and syntactical level. This enables the project to support comparison between diverse entities that exhibit the same types of relationships — i.e., element to element, frame to frame.</p>
<p>Overall, this project acknowledges the fact that timelines and chronologies are artifactual representations of time charged with humanistic and symbolic value. Consequently, comparison between representations of time should not forgo the meaning or specificity of values proper to each. However, rhetorical aspects of chronologies, as well as their contextual and historical circumstances of production and use, are difficult to represent in data structures that could be analyzed and compared. Formal data structures — especially generalizable ones — are not particularly suited to encoding certain features of graphical expression. Aesthetic dimensions of color, tone, or line weight may be easily overlooked — not to mention such features as a Cherubim holding curtains aside to reveal an information-bearing element (Fig. 1). These features play a fundamental role in the interpretation of individual chronologies, evidencing their production and use as cultural artifacts. Acknowledging this, this project is committed to respecting and preserving rhetorical aspects of chronologies when transposing into computational representations. This requires not only considering them at all stages of the project development, but also acknowledging their significance as terms that enable comparison.</p>
<p>As mentioned, one way this project departs from Linked Data is its commitment to comparison, connection, and enrichment of data through emergent semantic interlinking, rather than requiring entities and relations to conform to a uniform, prescriptive set of definitions established in advance of their analysis. The ways in which Linked Data establish relationality are problematic, in that the translation of local entities, whether logical or semantic, into LD seldom resolves in the direct correspondence of synonyms — a fact for which LD makes no provisions. The result is loss of information at frame and element levels, which inevitably contributes to the misrepresentation of artifacts, their features, their meaning and their overall specificities. This is not conducive to the instantiation of meaningful comparisons, since the entities being compared are not the original ones. Furthermore, the act of subsuming entities into a dominating system has hegemonic effects, in the sense that a given system can preclude the representation of ideas that do not fit into its scheme. In this sense, operating under such premises results in a loss of accuracy, relevance and specificity, indeed a loss of <em>difference</em> , in order to acquire of a degree ofhomogeneitythat redefines the descriptions of the entities and is inevitably carried over to the comparison itself. Conversely, both quantity and quality of difference, as specificity, must be preserved.</p>

<h2 id="synchronization-and-correlation">Synchronization and Correlation</h2>
<p>The approach used in the Heterochronologies project preserves the specificity of each system — i.e., its mode of presentation, graphical features, and cultural contexts — while supporting correlations and comparisons. The project is designed so that operations carried out by the system enable comparison of representations without the need to either translate or subsume individual chronologies and comparative processes into a dominating epistemological paradigm.Constitutive differenceis to be identified and respected without being reduced, both within individual representations and in the comparative act. Constitutive difference suggests that specificity is inherent in an artifact, but able to be abstracted from its particular features into a systematic means of comparison. Our approach to using this concept was to create a descriptive vocabulary from graphical images that could be used as the basis of a diagrammatic structure from which quantitative metrics could be derived. For example, a temporal unit in a biblical timeline would have a different graphical and thus quantitative value than in a geological one, but its value within the source graphic could be specified within the system of frames, axes, spans, intervals, and other components by which it was constituted. While this sounds abstract, it was meant to provide a way to generate quantitative value within each graphical example on its own terms.</p>
<p>One intuitive approach to comparing graphical representations of time that respects constitutive difference is to align these representations around chronological events that they have in common. To reiterate, this approach invokes the concept offloating correlationacross points of reference in distinct contexts, chronologies, and representations, rather than within a single unifying framework. By establishing common points of reference across contexts, distinct chronologies can be aligned and synchronized relative to these reference points. The already-mentioned 1833 Leonid meteor shower is one such common point of reference: it is an event that has been witnessed, recorded, and represented in different yet similar ways by a number of cultural groups, and for this reason it provides the opportunity to compare multiple representations of time by aligning them according to a common feature. By aligning Native Americans’ Winter Counts (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) records of the Leonid meteor shower, the temporal view of events is extended in a way that enables comparison of structural, logical and topical elements across different contexts of representation and documentation. Points for alignment may be identified using automated processes of data analysis, but the Heterochronologies system is designed to support the manual selection of fixed events, since it is conceivable that users might want to specify such points in their analyses.</p>

<p>Synchronization of chronologies through floating correlations between temporal reference points is a useful functionality, but it does not solve all challenges of chronological comparison. For instance, a linear representation that displays the succession of ancient Egyptian dynasties cannot be synched with Minard’s representation of Napoleon’s 1812 march to and retreat from Moscow (Fig. 5) because of lack of common temporal reference points. Similarly, other temporal representations may, conceivably, express fundamentally different conceptions of time — e.g., linear versus circular/cyclical — that may not be able to be related through alignment of fixed events. With a lack of common temporal measures and structures, distinct representations of time are temporally incommensurable. However, other features may still be compared even in such cases: formal, structural, semantic, logical, rhetorical; types of data structures, distributions, intervals, quantity and quality of data points, and so on. Some timelines and chronologies may be aligned because they share, for instance, the same definition of years, months, days, or periods of time. Therefore, in the absence of shared temporal reference points, temporal <em>markers</em> and <em>descriptors</em> like dates can be leveraged as coordinates that enable synchronization.</p>

<p>Still, while markers of temporal events or intervals can be used to identify comparable features of disparate chronologies, they do not ensure that these chronologies can be easily synchronized. For instance, thePaintingandPlumbingtasks listed in the Ganntt chart of Fig. 6 (items 9 and 7 from the bottom, respectively) may be formally represented as having been completed at the same time, but the metric is not sufficiently granular to support correlation of information at a level that could guarantee precise synchronicity — the bars and bands are too crude. While activities that take place in time are represented here within time buckets or divisions, the actual unfolding of the activity may not happen within such discrete separations. In fact, time can be subdivided infinitely, and determining the points on which comparisons can be made within such divisions raises metaphysical as well as epistemological problems. At one extreme, the chronology titled “Eternity to Eternity” (Fig. 7) provides an edge case for thinking about the types of comparisons which can be enabled and supported when different extensions of time are put in relation. The challenge of periodization within such an incalculable time scale poses certain paradoxes — can the infinite be segmented when the start and end points referenced are basically indeterminate? These challenges quickly shift from theoretical abstractions to practical dilemmas in creating data representations. How can such subdivisions of “eternity” be translated into specified intervals in a JSON format?</p>
<p>Altogether, uncertainty remains an important factor to acknowledge when identifying points of alignment between chronologies. For this reason, the Heterochronologies system adopts a probabilistic approach to chronological comparison and alignment. Operations for contrasting, comparing, and correlating graphical representation of time should not be presented as fact, but with confidence intervals that indicate degrees of uncertainty. This approach enables the comparison of chronologies that employ non-discrete representations of time, with values that are not explicitly specified.</p>

<h2 id="project-development">Project Development</h2>
<h2 id="defining-a-problem-set">Defining a Problem Set</h2>
<p>The first phase of project development involved the analysis of a <em>problem set</em> — a group of about a dozen images, each exhibiting a different graphical representation of time. The selection of the problem set was informed by the need to a) create a representative selection of approaches in terms of scale, graphical structure, cultural points of view, and other features, and to b) collect edge cases that would challenge, complicate, or otherwise highlight key conceptual or formal aspects of chronologies. The problem set was not meant to be exhaustive in any way, but rather to raise problems for existing approaches that concern the Heterochronologies project, and in this sense to provide fundamental constraints that must be considered for comparing diverse representations of time. These are from Western, Russian, Chinese, Native American cultures, and date from the early Renaissance (with roots in antiquity) through to the early 20th century. Throughout research, we referred to the images in this problem set to iteratively develop conventions for describing the logical, graphical, and semantic structures entailed by representations of time. The problem set includes bothchronologies— date stamped, discrete, event-specific representations of historical events — andtimelines— continuous temporal phenomena in a unified linear format. Although the images in the problem set share certain features of continuous and linear representations of time, we selected examples that posed challenges for comparison; thus, while some of the images are more strictly concerned with temporal relations, others emphasize relationships among historical events.</p>
<p>As we started thinking about the premises under which comparison of graphical representations of time could be carried out and the computational processes and environments that might host it, we concentrated on defining the types of information presented by such artifacts as well as the ways in which that information is represented. Specifically, we focused on identifying and defining a) how meaning is instantiated by timelines and chronologies; and b) the visual/logical conventions and structures within them that represent and expose difference. The problem set was designed to provide a wide range of data structures with a variety of metrics.</p>
<p>Some key issues emerged from our iterative analysis of these examples (the complete details of which are included in the Appendix). These included formal problems involved in qualifying representations with respect to a comparative model, and representational problems involved in transposing graphical elements into a computational syntax that would make them tractable for analysis. These issues were: the role of grids in the establishment and identification of synchronicity; the presence of coexisting timelines within single artifacts; overlapping axes and their challenging of the definition of frame; implicit axes; heterogeneity of axes’ scale (granularity); importance of rhetorical, sometimes decorative, elements to the establishment of value/meaning; ‘orientation’ and direction of reading and interpretation; the importance of fixed points in the synchronization of chronologies; ‘soft’ relations and non-Boolean data; heterogeneity of data types (Boolean/non-Boolean) converging in one chart; need for representing uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="graphical-approachstrategies">Graphical Approach/Strategies</h2>
<p>After selecting the problem set, we identified graphical, structural, and semantic elements in the chronologies and formulated a descriptive vocabulary — or notation system — of components that were represented across instances in the problem set. Here, graphical methods of analysis were used as a primary mode of knowledge production, which further developed our understanding of project needs and challenges<a class="footnote-ref" href="#drucker2014"> [drucker2014] </a>. This taxonomy demonstrated the possibility of consistently defining and hence comparing elements in the chronologies, but it did not adequately account for structural relationships among these elements, nor aesthetic variations. The fundamental taxonomy (described in detail in the next section) included the terms <em>frame</em> (outer border in logical, metrical, and graphical senses); <em>axes</em> (orientation for time sequences and periodization); <em>span</em> (range and intervals of chronology); <em>segments</em> (subdivisions of span that helped identify range and scale); <em>symbols</em> (graphical features, legends, other elements that were glosses on the timeline/chronologies or additions to it); and <em>significant points</em> (known events useful for alignment).</p>
<p>In order to formulate conventions for describing these structural and aesthetic features, we developed a second approach which included the formulation of a markup language or computational syntax that could schematically represent the visual elements in the chronologies. Because a programming language is designed to support the specification of a wider variety of functionalities than the language itself, we could design such a language to specify differences across chronologies that would still adhere to a common scheme of specification. Through following principles of computer programming, such as the insistence on the reuse of code, the elimination of syntactical redundancies, and the modularization of components, we could design such a language to operate as an efficient means of summarizing and comparing elements across the chronologies.</p>
<h2 id="platform-development">Platform development</h2>
<p>The third phase was the design of a conceptual and computational framework that could support the analysis of chronological representations for research and pedagogy. A key principle guiding this design is that components of a chronology are often incommensurable across chronologies, but they can be correlated — either as specific dates or in reference to common temporal events. The challenge here is to perform analysis on linguistic, graphic, or pictorial contents, while still accounting for the structural and syntactic idiosyncrasies of graphical representations. To showcase this approach, we designed mock-ups of a Time Capsule software environment that illustrate how a user might interact with chronologies of interest.</p>
<p>A main feature of the Time Capsule framework is a chrono-referencing scheme that enables floating correlation and temporal synchronization between chronologies. Chrono-References are chronological systems in common use that we selected to serve as substitutable schemes of reference for chronological analysis. These include Gregorian, Julian, Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Egyptian (dynasties), Winter counts, Mayan, and Chinese calendar systems. A second set might include geological time periods (Archean, Cambrian, Ordovician etc.), anthropological/archaeological ones (Bronze Age, Iron Age and so on linked to specific geographical locations), and other domain specific, discipline or task-driven schemes, such as carbon dating. To demonstrate how chrono-referencing might operate, we present the Time Capsule mock-up with a sample of chronologies called a Collection, annotated with Chrono-References. The purpose of the Collection is to demonstrate how a computational framework for comparing chronologies could operate in practice and extend to other objects of study.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>To aid this approach, we drew on the substantial precedents for programming languages that are used to specify visual elements, such as the <em>D3</em> and <em>three.js</em> JavaScript libraries. These code libraries involve a) a syntax for drawing graphical elements; b) certain pre-made functions that produce more complex visual elements, and c) in the case of <em>D3</em> , a data visualization system that enables <em>binding</em> data to graphical elements, and then adjusting them dynamically. Libraries like <em>D3</em> can be used to produce a wide variety of visualizations using the same components and similar techniques, although with some unifying constraints. To develop a computational visualization with this code library, a programmer envisions certain graphics and functionalities, and then works backward to identify functionalities provided by the library that could produce this result. We envision this method of ‘working backwards’ as an approach to devise a markup language that would allow for comparison between existing visualizations. In short, if we can design a new language to produce a variety of different visualizations, this language can also be used to compare them.</p>
<p>Within this framework, we worked on finding ways to construct existing visualizations out of computational elements. The method of devising a programming syntax raised fundamental design considerations concerning how to specify and relate graphical and structural elements. For example, the axis object in the Gantt chart (Fig. 6) could be treated as a ‘global’ object with attributes that other elements in the chart could ‘inherit;’ <em>or</em> it could be defined as a ‘local’ object with its own unique attributes. Through identifying and discussing design considerations such as this, we assessed the trade-offs and implications for comparing chronologies through these methods. Here, a central concern was to ensure that the constraints and patterns of a programming syntax did not over-determine our scheme of description and comparison. In the case of the axis, for example, the axes were not defined as ‘global’ objects, which would be a convenience for programming, because that would impose a computational design pattern onto the visualization that it does not specify. In all instances, the Heterochronologies environment worked to avoid subsuming specificity and difference into either generality or uniformity.</p>
<p>In the initial version of our programming syntax, classes and attributes were specified for elements which would define their more specific properties. <em>Axis</em> classes, for example, included <em>horizontal, continuous, named, ranged, segmented</em> , and <em>crossed</em> elements, each of which would define the appearance of the axis and the possible attributes it could have. One of these class attributes — <em>crossed</em> — joined elements together so that they could represent multiple attributes of data (also called ‘dimensions’), which would then enable plotting data according to these elements. For the Gantt chart, the axis and table were ‘crossed’ so that data with an axis attribute and a table attribute could be populated among them. Other attributes like segments could take another element as a property, allowing for a kind of nesting or inheritance structure.</p>
<p>Altogether, this exercise in creating a programming syntax could be described as ‘projecting’ a programming environment onto a graphical representation. However, the benefit of this approach lies not so much in its product as its process — recognizing that much of the programming was extracted from the graphical features, not merely projected onto them. Through the devised syntax, graphical and structural elements that could be represented with the same vocabulary were identified and transposed to the new analytical system without losing sight of their specificity. This raised some challenges. As the markup language developed, it became clear that it would be easier to view the specified graphical and structural elements relationally in visual form, instead of as displays of code. This was the motivation for the third approach in the methodology: to draw relational diagrams of the chronologies and their components. At this time, another provisional taxonomy of components was defined that persisted throughout our experiments and discussions.</p>
<p>The design of the relational diagrams was informed in part by visual programming environments where elements can be combined to make other elements. Experiments with the ways in which basic elements could be combined to make new elements draw out these combination sequences. As the diagrams developed iteratively, the taxonomy of components that could represent the patterns was updated. In an approach similar to the development of the programming syntax, the iterative design of the relational diagrams raised considerations and challenges for creating a scheme of chronology comparison and consequently prompted further discussion. At this point, a crucial distinction was made between <em>spans</em> , or graphical extensions that imply directionality or continuity, and <em>sets</em> , which are graphical groupings of other elements that do not imply directionality and continuity. Conventions developed for specifying non-directional relationships between these elements which were still able to account for structural hierarchies that they implied.</p>
<p>This series of iterations on the designs of relational diagrams allowed simplification of their organization and identification of broader structural similarities among them. [See Figures 9, 10, and 11 below.] A graphical system was iteratively designed to enable these structures to be compared in a simplified and intuitive way. In the final graphical system, textual descriptions of elements (e.g., axis, span) are summarized with symbolic glyphs. Instead of representing relationships between structural elements with lines, which tended to imply directionality, overlapping regions are used to indicate constraints that certain elements impose on others, and graphical conventions indicate high-level properties of these constraints, like their segmentations.</p>
<p>Overall, the process of developing a graphical system enabled a <em>grapho-logical analysis</em> of chronologies: the use of a notation system to summarize structural features of chronological representations for visual comparison. The concept of grapho-logical analysis is that of extracting quantitative metrics from the specific structures of chronological representations, which enables these structure to be analyzed and visualized. In other words, it is a method of abstracting structured data from schematic images, which can then be examined for further analysis. By identifying relationships between frame, span, interval, tick-marks or units and other graphic features, and then specifying them in a notation system, the value of any particular element can be analyzed and visualized relative to the whole.</p>
<p>Grapho-logical analysis supports the comparison of chronological representations that involve different specifications or indices of time, but comparable structures for representing time nonetheless. In a biblical time frame, for instance, Creation is dated to 4004 BCE. This allows for an explicit calculation of the year of Christ’s birth and the present, from Adam to Noah and by extension, spans of time in the present. By contrast, the use of historical timeline for events from the colonization of America to the first presidents of the United States is designed on grid that spans only about two hundred years from 1607 to 1800. The units in the second chronology are decades, but they imply a relation to the Gregorian calendar and the birth of Christ as the 0 year. The two timelines can be compared graphically, with the relative value metrically computed. A presidential term of four years has a value when it is located in a span of two hundred years. The same two hundred years of history has a different relative value within a six thousand year span (or within the endless expanse of eternity).</p>
<p>The different scales can also be demonstrated through a graphic comparison. This supports correlation — using the zero year or using the time span of the historical chart next the metric of in “Eternity to Eternity” (Figure 8). The method allows us to see (literally, in visual form) the relationship of one schema to another while also understanding the relative quantitative value of events within each. Presidential terms might diminish in significance relative to the span of eternal timescale, or, by contrast, demonstrate the value of the specific granularity of measures. What is the value of a year? It can be calculated relative to the span to which the year belongs. Generating such metric values supports comparison and correlation — the representation of <em>constitutive difference</em> — without forcing either scheme to be represented in terms of the other. The approach gets at the specifics of value in each scheme (four years of two hundred, two hundred years of six thousand). In this way, grapho-logical analysis offers a schematic presentation of the information and visualizes the relative scales in an immediately graspable format that is also quantitative and computable.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-and-contributions">Implementation and Contributions</h2>
<p>The Heterochronologies project aims to make several contributions to humanistic study of graphical expressions of time-keeping: a) a descriptive vocabulary that supports the specification of structural features in chronological representations; b) a grapho-logical system for analyzing these features; c) a computational framework for correlating and comparing these features, in the form of a digital workspace for research and pedagogy built on this computational framework. The project is focused on the analysis of the specific features of these chronologies in structural and semantic terms, and gave rise to the concept of a computational framework that supports the interactive analysis of chronologies, exemplified by the Time Capsule — a speculative digital workspace where the analytic, descriptive, and comparative methods are combined in a platform for research and pedagogy.</p>
<h2 id="descriptive-vocabulary">Descriptive Vocabulary</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the project began with creation of a descriptive and analytic vocabulary of the structural and semantic components of graphical chronologies. The vocabulary is meant to be general enough to apply to most individual images but specific enough to provide analysis of features in each visual representation.</p>
<p>The structural components identified were:</p>
<p>frame (outer border as a logical, metrical defining boundary);span (with extension, range, and marked intervals);axis (main line of temporal development or sequence with a directional orientation);segments (each a span with its own range and scale);symbols (signs and elements used in a legend as a graphical notation system forinformation);significant/fixed points (known events that can be used for alignment across chronologies);set (graphical grouping);quantitative value (scale or metrics);implied components (for example, longitude when only latitude is explicitly represented).</p>
<p>The semantic components are the units of time:</p>
<p><em>lifetimes</em> ;historical <em>events</em> ; <em>periods</em> defined by features like reigns of monarchs or establishment of nations or empires; <em>cycles</em> of seasons or calendrical systems; andothers within an emerging typology derived from the chronologies.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>A typology of graphical structures is also useful for standardizing description of the chronologies and relating them to data structures:</p>
<p>tree (branching and hierarchical);river (flow, unclear segmentation, and vague or approximate metrics);grid (clear crossing points, or column/row values, and explicit metrics);score (synchronicity and a topological structure);bars (chronologies and spans, more or less explicit metrics);segmented wheels and disk;other formats derived from examples.</p>
<p>This descriptive vocabulary provides the basis for terms of comparison between representations of chronologies: from point to point; among data values; to allow visualizations to be embedded into or overlaid on each other; and to support a relational model of contrast and correlation. One principle of contrast guiding the project is that data points have value in relation to a calculable ratio of granularity and density. In addition, these points generally carry an attribute specifying degrees of uncertainty. Some degrees of uncertainty are merely a factor of granularity: the Battle of Hastings takes place in 1066, but the actual span of this event in terms of preparation, action, intervals, continuity, aftermath and other factors make mapping it into a specific calendrical system difficult if not impossible. Uncertainty can arise from any number of factors: lack of precision in the information, or in the phenomenon represented, or in the representation.</p>
<h2 id="grapho-logical-analysis">Grapho-logical analysis</h2>
<p>In parallel with developing a descriptive and analytic vocabulary, the project made use of various graphical methods for analyzing the structures and representation of chronologies. An initial question was whether formal data could be extracted automatically from the visual representations, by using optical character recognition (OCR) or other approaches to automated graphical analysis, or whether formal data could be specified by a custom notation system. Specifying the requirements of such formal approaches to data extraction and representation of structure led to the development of a grapho-logical notation system designed to facilitate and represent comparison and correlation of structural components. Grapho-logical analysis supports a connection between graphical images (timelines and chronologies) and logical structures that can be represented in computational terms, enabling their subsequent visualization and analysis. This addressed the challenge of identifying the ways in which the formal structures of chronologies could be represented as logical structures that are legible to computational processing. By determining the components of the logical structure, the typology of relationships among the components, and ways for these components of the formal structure to become a data structure, this method addressed ways in which a data structure could be abstracted and/or extracted directly from an image.</p>
<p>The grapho-logical approach to comparison also provides a formal notational scheme as a shorthand for display of that analysis within the Time Capsule workspace (see figures below). Grapho-logical analysis is based on the components and factors of comparison outlined above (axes, orientation, spans, events, and segments). For instance, start-points and end-points of an axis provide a crucial feature on which to make correlations. (The space of time from Creation to the Flood, for instance, is different from that defined by fixed dates such as 1700-1890 or that indicated by a span from Eternity to Eternity.) One crucial tenet of belief guiding the project has been that graphical methods of analysis are primary modes of knowledge production, and demonstrating this is important. The graphical elements of the original documents are considered essential information, even when they are abstracted into a second-order grapho-logical system. This notation scheme is analytic (it shows how the relation of structural features in the chronologies can be understood in a distilled, diagrammatic, mode) and representational (it encodes that analysis in a visual shorthand). It is designed to represent <em>constitutive difference</em> across representations, rather than to indicate the structure of these representations definitively.</p>
<h2 id="the-time-capsule">The Time Capsule</h2>
<p>Through acknowledging the potential of (1) floating correlations to make disparate chronological schemes of reference comparable, (2) a descriptive vocabulary to identify structural and semantic features of chronologies, and (3) grapho-logical methods of analysis to summarize, clarify, and compare these features, the idea of a computational framework was devised that could assist researchers in identifying, annotating, and analyzing these features. Such a framework would allow for the specification of points within a chronological system to be isolated for correlation with other chronologies, as well as the visualization of these correlations and their characteristics. As noted earlier, the Leonid meteor showers demonstrate how the significance of an event is valued differently within a Winter Count that focused on one event per yearly cycle by contrast with its place in an astronomical calendar in which this was one among many celestial events, though it also repeated about every thirty-three years. A computational framework could support the specification of the structural organization and value-producing apparatus of these chronological representations — one at a time, or comparatively.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how this computational system might operate in practice, we designed mock-ups of a Time Capsule software environment, which demonstrates practical applications of the various contributions just outlined. It is imagined as a digital sandbox that supports various activities: grapho-logical analysis (or modeling of logical relationships expressed by graphics), semantic topic modeling of linguistic data extracted automatically (or manually) from the chronologies, a formal analysis of values generated within the ontological structure of the chronologies, and, a workspace for research and pedagogy. In the Time Capsule, existing chronologies are displayed and their structural as well as semantic features analyzed in a combination of automated and hand-annotated practice.</p>
<p>The Time Capsule is not a working software prototype, but a sketch for how considerations developed through the Heterochronologies project can be implemented in a computational architecture. Developing the Time Capsule enabled us to identify a set of minimum functionalities and techniques that would support this task:</p>
<p>The user can import chronological representations as images and view them in a Collection with associated metadata and information (Figure 11). To support this, each imported chronological representation can be paired with information stored in a JSON format and indexed by a database, called itschronological metadata. The Time Capsule could be displayed in an interactive web-based interface that retrieves information from thechronological metadatastored either on the user’s machine, or in a remote repository, and uses HTML, CSS, canvas, and JavaScript to render interactive representations of thechronological metadatato the screen.The user can select one or multiple chronological representations for annotation and analysis (Figure 9).The user can manually annotate regions of the chronological representations in order to interactively specify their structural and semantic features, which will update itschronological metadata(Figure 9A). The X and Y position of each user annotation, along with the type of structural feature that it represents (i.e., defined by the descriptive vocabulary) is stored in thechronological metadata.Optionally, the user can use optical character recognition (OCR) to automatically annotate regions of the chronological representation that might be of interest for further analysis. Once recognized, text associated with automatically annotated regions is stored in thechronological metadata.A summary of thechronological metadatais displayed both graphically (Figure 9B) and in the format of a markup language that the user can edit in a dynamic text field (Figure 9C).The user can manually specify the structural features of chronological representations using a markup language, which summarizes thechronological metadataand makes it editable in a dynamic text field (Figure 9C). The markup in the dynamic text field is color-coded to correspond to particular structural features that have been identified, which are also visible as graphical annotations (Figure 9A) and a visual summary (Figure 9B).When the user modifies the markup in the dynamic text field, they are subsequently prompted to annotate the chronological representation to specify the graphical features that the markup corresponds to. The user can click elements of the markup in the dynamic text field to change their corresponding references. Each of these changes is stored in thechronological metadata.The user can toggle the visibility of windows and features in the software environment to suit the task at hand (Figure 9D). The modularity of windows supports the extension of functionalities in the software environment with plug-ins.The user can specify temporal and chronological attributes of the structural features that they have already specified (Figure 10). Color-coding reflects relationships between temporalities and chronologies across their representations.The user can select which structural features have chronological properties (Figure 10B) for visualization as timelines (Figure 10C).The user can annotate visualized timelines with text (Figure 10C). Annotations are stored in thechronological metadata.Optionally, the user can use optical character recognition (OCR) and subsequent topic modeling to identify the prevalence of certain terms across chronological representations, and view the relationships of these terms to each chronology (left-hand side of Figure 10C).User annotations that have automatically been stored in thechronological metadataare summarized in the Collection browser (Figure 11).</p>
<p>In addition to access to the Collection of graphical examples (the original problem set and any additional images), the Time Capsule would be pre-loaded with a set of defaultChrono-Referencingschemes. The Chrono-References are formal data schemes drawn from an inventory of solar calendars, lunar-solar, lunar, seasonal, and other systems (e.g., dynastic histories, geological and archaeological time scales). The workspace exemplified by the Time Capsule is designed to allow for pedagogical engagement, to ask and answer such questions as: what can be learned from comparing seasonal cycles to cosmological ones? Lunar calendars to solar? Or biblical chronological schemes to archaeological ones? And so on. Individual timelines and chronologies — of historical events or personal histories — would be able to be mapped into the frameworks through the annotation tools, thus providing a work environment for individual and collaborative work. For research purposes, the platform would allow data to be uploaded from time-keeping or time-stamped activities and displayed in relation to any of the graphical instances or on a blank template with Chrono-Referencing schemes called into play.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> (Figures 9, 10, 11).</p>

<p>The practical application of ideas to the Time Capsule is meant to connect the analytical engagement with research and pedagogical activity. The design of the Time Capsule includes recognition of a basic epistemological concern with constitutive difference. Such difference stems from the structural, logical, semantic, and rhetorical features of these representation (intrinsic difference). In order to conduct a meaningful comparison, differences among representations may be identified (extrinsic difference). Intrinsically non-Boolean relations represented in some chronologies (those that cannot be adequately expressed in explicit, formal terms) also need to be respected within the formalization process. Regardless of whether the compared chronologies include non-Boolean terms or not, comparisons are hosted in a probabilistic environment and represented accordingly, asfloating correlations.</p>
<p>Other issues remain, of course, and a working prototype would expose any number of problems with the conceptual prototype. Some are theoretical, or epistemological, such as the method for representing infinity in a data structure, or for representing simultaneity or synchronicity. These are philosophical issues as much as technical ones. A practical matter is how to segment the chronologies, and what the justification for segmentation might be in any instance. The semantics of segmentation invoke the description of units of time, mentioned above (days, lifetimes, solar cycles, and other temporal units) with their symbolic as well as metrical value. Unresolved issues worth mentioning here are related to the challenges posed by the visual motifs of graphical representations which play an important rhetorical role but are not part of the formal temporal notation system; these qualities of inflection and style in lettering, drawing, line treatment, iconography, mythical figures, and allegorical images which, while incidental to the logical structure, are crucial to the semantic value, could not be readily absorbed into a logical structure.</p>
<p>Indeed, a thorough analysis of chronologies ought to consider structural, logical, semantic, and graphical elements. The structural elements include the value of formal position, graphical zones that map onto visual zones for machine learning, framing or boundary delimitation, components seen relationally down to the item level, and various syntaxes of part to whole of specific features. Initially, these were subjected to an automated image analysis process, akin to OCR, that pointed at graphical entities. This identified various semantic features, including components that lend themselves to topic modeling, statistical analysis, and to humanistic interpretative study within the ideological, material, and cultural contexts of which they are an expression and in which they are embedded. The graphical qualities thus gave rise to a combined typology of schematic forms, understood diagrammatically as images that perform work, obtain value through their structure (e.g., the rooted tree and the un-rooted tree; the matrix/grid and the cycle), and are available to a combination of automated and human analysis. The extent to which the analysis of graphical form can be fully automated remains to be seen, as naturally many features that give the chronologies their visual and cultural specificity will not lend themselves to computational analysis without reduction to a point that renders the information descriptively inadequate.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goals of the Heterochronologies system have been to analyze visual representations of time — chronologies and timelines — as meaningful cultural and historical objects in a way that preserves their specificity. Chronologies perform semantic and syntactic work of embodying historically and culturally specific understandings of the boundaries and values of temporal events. To analyze chronology with this in mind, a method of graphical analysis of frames, axes, components, and features was developed along with an elaboration of a semantics of time units (days, lifetimes, periods etc.). The use of graphical methods of schematic logical analysis was part of this work, demonstrating the value of visual approaches as an intellectual component of research and study. The need for a computational framework to support interactive analysis of chronologies arose from the use of these graphical methods to establish parameters on which value at any particular point could be assessed through correlation, rather than through a crosswalk into a reductively uniform system. Finally, the project worked to develop a design prototype for a Time Capsule work environment that allows graphical correlation, annotation, and visual comparison for pedagogical and research purposes.</p>
<p>While implementation and working proof of concept remain to be realized, the conceptual development of the Heterochronologies project is an experiment in approaching problems of knowledge representation through graphical objects and visual methods. This is an opening to innovative work in digital scholarship. Chronologies are graphical, pictorial representations of data over time. They express semantic value within a defined frame, both through the use of structural and logical data representation techniques, as well as iconography. Contrastingly, the re-mediation of those artifacts under the graphical scheme we created extracts value from the pictorial and transposes it to a higher, conceptual, diagrammatic level. By abstractly describing the structures that compose and instantiate the artifacts, the diagrammatic display enables the relations that define the semantic values to come to the fore, and the entities involved in those relations to be thusly described relationally.</p>
<p>While such a system of representation is built upon an identification and formal description of the artifacts through a vocabulary of components, it is not hegemonic in that it intentionally concentrates on constitutive difference rather than translation. The project systematically and deliberately avoided establishing a single overarching temporal frame to which all other chronologies would be referenced. The inventory of Chrono-Referencing schemes supports correlation and comparison, so that chronologies do not have to be subsumed into a unified or single standard. While this project remains in prototype and proof of concept phase, considerable analytic work and design has been accomplished with regard to fundamental principles of graphical methods of analysis, chronologies as a specific case for comparative ontologies, and the idea of a computational framework that supports interactions in a software environment for research and pedagogy. This work is exemplified by the Time Capsule, which demonstrates the design of an extensible Library and set of Chrono-Referencing tools. The concepts being proved here are currently being developed as working prototypes.</p>

<p>A further analysis of the relation between frame and elements informed by formal logic and analytic philosophy traditions reveals how the frame ultimately models the reality in which elements exist. Specifically, as it pertains to the environment it circumscribes, the frame is responsible for answering the questionwhat is,in that it identifies the entities that exist within itself and thereby grants them ontological status. However, it also defines the nature of those entities by characterizing and modelling the semantic relations in which they are involved and consequently the rules that dictate their participation in those relations; by defining the essence and quality of elements, rules and relations, it establishes the metaphysics of the graphical representation.

<p>Oral histories conducted with survivors are infinitely rich sources for understanding the complex events of the Holocaust. As first-person narratives, oral history interviews with Holocaust survivors provide vital, eyewitness testimony about the rise of Nazi Germany, the violent acts of genocide, and reflections on its aftermath. Theera of the witness,as Annette Wieviorka calls it, coincides with the emergence of institutional recording initiatives, such as those at Yad Vashem, Yale’s Fortunoff Video Archive, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), and the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wieviorka2006"> [wieviorka2006] </a>. Altogether, these archives have recorded well over one-hundred thousand hours of testimony and preserved hundreds of thousands of individual stories.</p>
<p>Because of the sheer size of these collections, indexing systems are critically important for accessing their content. As such, all of these collections can be searched effectively by names, dates, events, places, organizations, and various subject headings. This is becausenoun-based ontologiesform the taxonomic structure of most indexing systems and finding aids. Attuned to the objective realm of what was said, these ontologies help make the general content of an oral history discoverable and accessible to researchers and the broader community of listeners. When users enter keywords into a textbox, search and retrieval works because the content is consistently and thoroughly described by a standardized, controlled vocabulary<a class="footnote-ref" href="#presner2016"> [presner2016] </a>.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this is also the approach of most entity-recognition software packages, such as OpenNLP<a class="footnote-ref" href="#apache2017"> [apache2017] </a>and SpaCy<a class="footnote-ref" href="#explosionai2020"> [explosionai2020] </a>, which are very successful at identifying things said, such as proper names, organizations, geographic locations, historical events, dates, units of time, quantities, and other numerical units, such as percentages and times of day. But one of the fundamental limits is the focus on extracting isolated elements (primarily nouns) rather than larger narrative units that describe what people did and what was done to them. The purpose of this paper is to ask: In what ways can oral histories be mined computationally to index how survivors narrate behaviors, actions, reactions, assessments, and modes of self-orientation and personal agency? This is vitally important in Holocaust testimonies since agency is often described within networks of violence and coercion. This paper explores a method for extracting, characterizing, and interlinkingsemantic tripletsto index and analyze vectors of action and agency, rather than just discrete topics, themes, or isolated nouns. In so doing, we complement conventional indexing to gain a richer, nuanced understanding of the events, agents, and actions described in a testimony.</p>
<p>A semantic triplet is a grammatical unit consisting ofSubjects,Relations, andObjects.Subjects are units consisting of nouns, primarily people, pronouns, and proper names, as well as direct modifiers of the subject.Relationsare verb units including one or more verbs, related prepositions, and modifiers like adverbs.Objects, both direct and indirect, have a broader range of parts of speech and include regular noun units, adjectives, adverbs, and more. For example,I removed the yellow patch<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is a semantic triplet expressed as active speech (something the subject did), whileI was shipped to Auschwitzis a semantic triplet expressed as passive speech (something done by an unspecified agent to the subject). By linking semantic triplets with descriptive, keyword metadata, we hope to show how new patterns of agency and previously unrecognized “microhistories” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#zalcandbruttman2016"> [zalcandbruttman2016] </a>can be highlighted and discovered within oral histories. Rather than considering our method as a reduction or simplification of the text into discrete units of data, we argue that semantic triplets form a paratext that highlights the richness of the testimonial narrative by adding to existing metadata and methods of indexing.</p>

<h2 id="21-corpus-1-david-boders-1946-interviews-with-displaced-survivors">2.1 Corpus #1: David Boder’s 1946 Interviews with Displaced Survivors</h2>
<p>The psychologist and linguist David Boder has a unique place in the history of Holocaust testimony collection because he was the first person to record the voices of displaced survivors in their own words after the end of World War II.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> In the summer and early fall of 1946, he conducted over a hundred interviews with Jewish survivors and other displaced people in nine different languages (mostly in German and Yiddish, but also in English, Russian, Polish, French, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Spanish), using a relatively new technology called a wire recorder.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> He carried out his interviews in Displaced Persons (DP) camps and other safe houses in France, Switzerland, Italy, and Germany, mostly with Jewish survivors of concentration camps and slave labor camps, as well as with a smaller group of non-Jewish refugees consisting of Mennonites and other Christians who had fled Soviet territories. The interviews range in length from about 15 minutes to over four hours, with most about one-hour in duration. He asked over 16,000 questions to his subjects in an attempt to understand the historical events of the Holocaust and learn about his interviewee’s personal story of loss and survival.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Today, Boder’s interviews are available online, as audio files in their original languages as well as in English translation, through the Illinois Institute of Technology’s “Voices of the Holocaust” project.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>After the interviews were recorded, Boder spent nearly ten years preparing a 3,194-page anthology of the survivor reports, which he called <em>Topical Autobiographies of Displaced People</em> .<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> It consisted of typewritten translations, which he marked-up and indexed, of 70 of the testimonies. He developed the first indices for characterizing the experiences of Holocaust survivors, including asubjects and situationsindex with more than 300 entries, ageographic and ethnicindex with over 400 entries, apersons and organizationsindex with close to 300 entries, and atrauma inventoryenumerating 46 types of trauma and violence experienced by survivors. Hissubjects and situationsindex represented the first controlled vocabulary for indexing Holocaust testimonies and included shared experiences like deportations, selections, mistreatment, and killings as well as personal experiences such as food deprivation, thirst, and screaming.</p>
<p>Our analysis below will focus on two of these testimonies: The first is an interview he conducted on September 26, 1946, with a 34-year-old, Polish-Jewish woman named Anna Kovitzka (given the pseudonymAnna Kaletskaby Boder). Kovitzka lost most of her family, including her young baby, who she had given to a Christian Polish woman in the hopes that the child would be able to survive. That Polish woman was later denounced by a neighbor, and the child was killed. The hour-long interview, spoken in Yiddish, covers about eight years of her life and moves between her birthplace of Kielce, escaping the Grodno ghetto, being deported to Auschwitz, and, finally, at the end of the war, being driven back into Germany, and ending up after the war in Wiesbaden, where she is interviewed. The second interview is with a German-Jewish survivor named Jürgen Bassfreund, who was also deported to Auschwitz, where he worked in a forced labor factory. Conducted in Munich on September 20, 1946, Bassfreund describes the rise of Hitler in Germany, the deportation and death of his mother, and the horrific conditions he endured while being transferred between multiple concentration camps. We chose this particular interview because Bassfreund – who later changed his name to Jack Bass – was re-interviewed by the USC Shoah Foundation in 1997, in his home in Alabama.</p>
<h2 id="22-corpus-2-the-usc-shoah-foundation-visual-history-archive">2.2 Corpus #2: The USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archive</h2>
<p>Containing about 55,000 audiovisual testimonies, the Shoah Foundation’s Visual History Archive (VHA) is the largest digital archive of Holocaust and genocide testimonies in the world. The videos range in length from several minutes to more than ten hours, although most are between one and three hours in duration. Indexers trained by the Foundation tagged the videos with keywords by linking one-minute segments of video to one or more search terms in its 60,000+ word, hierarchical thesaurus. In addition, transcripts are currently being created for many of the testimonies in their original languages as well as in English translation.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Using a tool called a “Video Indexing Application,” the majority of the testimonies were automatically separated into discrete, one-minute segments, and an indexer was prompted to assign a keyword from the thesaurus to the segment (although not every segment had to have an indexing keyword). The VHA derived its indexing protocols from the National Information Standards Organization’s Z39.19 standard for the construction, format, and management of monolingual controlled vocabularies. While useful for identifying topics, people, places, and events for general searching, the index tends to obscure individual actions and agency, not to mention aspects of performative delivery, subjective experiences, and expressions of questioning, doubt, and possibility<a class="footnote-ref" href="#presner2016"> [presner2016] </a>. Even though the aim of the index is objectivity, it is important to underscore that a human listener decided what to index and what not to index; a human listener decided what indexing term to use and what indexing term not to use; and a human listener decided if a given narrative segment should be described by a keyword or not. What is missing in the indexing system’s “philosophy of pursued objectivity” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#uscshoahfoundation2006"> [uscshoahfoundation2006] </a>are the specific semantic expressions used by survivors to describe actions, give evaluative assessments, provide orientation, and tell about other types of agency and activities, including subjective experiences and everyday behaviors, reactions, and acts of resistance.</p>
<p>In addition to the Jürgen Bassfreund/Jack Bass re-interview, our analysis will focus on the testimony of Erika Jacoby. Jacoby, a Hungarian Jew deported to Auschwitz with her family in the Summer of 1944, survived the camp with her mother. Her family was among the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews deported to Auschwitz at the height of the mass murder operations at Auschwitz. She was separated from her grandparents and other members of her family at the ramp of Auschwitz-Birkenau and never saw them again. She was able to stay together with her mother, and both were selected for forced labor at Auschwitz. Her testimony was recorded in her home in Los Angeles in 1994. Like the testimony of Bass, the interview follows the structure of a chronological life-story, beginning with childhood, experiences during the War and Holocaust, liberation, and eventual immigration to the United States.</p>
<p>The four testimonies discussed in this article are intended to provide a proof-of-concept for a method to identify and index expressions of agency. Our hope is that the methods can be used to complement conventional, subject-based indexing and open new possibilities for cross-corpora analysis.</p>

<h2 id="31-semantic-triplets-extraction">3.1 Semantic Triplets Extraction</h2>
<p>At the highest level, the aim of our research method is the transformation of a Holocaust archives relational database (keywords linked to testimony segments) into a Holocaust triplets graph database (networks of semantic triplets derived from the testimonial transcripts). As shown in Figure 1, we use both interview transcripts and their metadata, while our main contribution, as discussed in this article, is the identification, extraction, and categorization of semantic triplets from the transcripts. Our process can be summarized as follows: First, we identify and extract triplets algorithmically from the cleaned transcripts; then, we use text mining methods to assign categories and cluster the triplets; finally, the results are manually reviewed (human check, correction, and curation). After that, they can be stored, along with the original metadata, in a Tableau dashboard or eventually a graph database for querying, indexing, and visualization. We will introduce these core methods below.</p>
<p>Triplestore and RDF store are databases optimized for storing and retrieving semantic triplets (<a class="footnote-ref" href="#rusher2006"> [rusher2006] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#peter2001"> [peter2001] </a>). In general, triplets take the form of subject-predicate-object expressions and can be searched through network relations between entities. Digital humanities scholars have used semantic web methods, such as linked data, to facilitate interoperable research structures to analyze social or cultural datasets<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hyvonen2020"> [hyvonen2020] </a>as well as to model scholarly processes in the humanities by exploring the productive tension between formally structured, semantic data and humanities scholarship<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bradleyandpasin2017"> [bradleyandpasin2017] </a>. Inspired by both the database design of Triplestore and RDF store and their humanistic applications, we have developed our own process of extracting semantic triplets from spoken testimonies. Our approach is best situated in the field of information extraction for domain specific documents (in our case, Holocaust and genocide testimonies), while the methods and ideas are replicable in other domains such as oral histories more broadly, autobiographies, and personal narratives.</p>
<p>Traditionally, researchers proceed by creating open information extractors using token related patterns (<a class="footnote-ref" href="#yatesetal2007"> [yatesetal2007] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fader2011"> [fader2011] </a>) or dependency parsing related features (<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wuandweld2010"> [wuandweld2010] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mausametal2012"> [mausametal2012] </a>). With the advancement of machine learning technologies, we now see a trend of switching the research focus from extracting informative and broad coverage semantic triplets to producing canonical triplets which are linguistically coherent<a class="footnote-ref" href="#angelietal2015"> [angelietal2015] </a>. This trend of research tends to focus on improving the extractors’ accuracy, and, to date, there are few applications that use semantic triplets to analyze spoken, personal narratives, which resist formalized structures. Our semantic triplets extraction method is an automated, rule-based process to aid close reading and focuses on extracting expressions of agency and statements that speak to memories of individual and collective actions.</p>
<p>This triplet extraction method leverages a combination of chunk parsing, also known as partial parsing, and domain specific dictionaries. It focuses on the lower-level chunks of nouns and/or adjectives (NAP) and verbs, which are groups of connected but non-recursive tokens with different levels in syntactic structures of sentences.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> We convert the basic linguistic representation of the chunks’ rules with regular expression from the NP and VP expressions of Abney (<a href="#abney1996">1996</a>)’s rules as:NAP→D?A<em>N</em>N|D?A*AandVP→V-tns|AuxV-ingwhereDmeans determiners,Ameans adjectives,Nmeans nouns,V-tnsmeans the variation of a verb depending on its tense,Auxmeans auxiliary, andV-ingmeans the present participle of a verb. Using the natural language processing tools in SpaCy, we further extend these rules for chunks using the built-in Noun Chunk function and a customized Matcher of verb chunks.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Our extension includes more parts of speech as the possible components around core nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and we link the chunks together to check if we fully process the sentences.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>For example, Figure 2 shows a parsing tree with the different parts of a triplet. In the sentence “I was clinging to the window,” we detect the active agency of window clinging with “I” as the subject noun chunk and “the window” as the object noun chunk. In this case, the verb chunk includes the verb, an auxiliary verb, and a preposition. Using this extraction method, in our four example testimonies, we are able to extract more than 3,000 triplets. Some sentences may contain multiple triplets, such as this sentence: “I went with her down to the door, and there I stood across the street, hidden in the gate, and I saw how my child was lying on the snow.” In this example, four triplets were extracted: “I went with her,”  “I stood across the street,”  “I hidden in the gate,” and “my child was lying on the snow.”</p>




























<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="A parsing tree showing how the sentence “I was clinging to the window” is separated into a semantic triplet consisting of a noun chunk for the subject (containing “I” ), a verb chunk for the relation (containing “was clinging to” ), and a noun chunk for the object (containing “the window” )." src=""

<p>When parsing longer sentences, we always include, in a separate column for each triplet, what we callcontext terms.We define the context terms to be all the related lexical chunks other than those included in the extracted triplet. In the first triplet above ( “I went with her” ), the contextual chunks are the following words: the door, the street, the gate, my child, the snow. The context is especially important when we want to understand an action embedded in a complex sentence or create network diagrams from the triplets.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="32-characterization-action-orientation-and-evaluation-aeo-categories-with-subcategories">3.2 Characterization: Action, Orientation, and Evaluation (AEO) Categories with Subcategories</h2>
<p>One of our methods for characterizing semantic triplets is derived from Labov and Waletzky’s<a class="footnote-ref" href="#labovandwaletsky1997"> [labovandwaletsky1997] </a>social-linguistic model of narratives, where clauses are characterized by temporal organization (the order in which the subject narrates events and actions in the story), evaluative description (personal assessments made by the narrator), and contextual orientation (usually information provided by the narrator that helps orient the listener). Statements of evaluation provide judgment about a person or situation, while statements of orientation provide contextual or relational information. Various scholars have developed tools or solved related problems using the Labov model: For example, Swanson et al.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#swansonetal2014"> [swansonetal2014] </a>created a part of speech (POS) based algorithm for clause type detection and labelling based on this model; and Saldias and Roy<a class="footnote-ref" href="#saldiasandroy2020"> [saldiasandroy2020] </a>used this model to train a classifier to analyze and compare spoken personal narratives. Although these applications to characterizing narratives focus on the clause level, the Labov model is also applicable to our research because triplets are derived from clauses and need to retain semantic information.</p>
<p>Not unlike the use of text mining to study literary “styles” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#jockersandunderwood2015"> [jockersandunderwood2015] </a>, we use our text mining methods to classify triplets by similar types of speech in order to discover relationships between different types of expressions of agency in oral histories. We divide descriptions of agency into four sub-categories: active, passive, coercive, and speculative speech. Active and passive speech are, respectively, actions done by the subject of the triplet and actions done by others to the subject; coercive speech may have an active structure but a passive meaning since it represents something the subject was forced to do (sometimes without mentioning the person or group responsible for the coercion); and, lastly, speculative speech, often expressed through modal verbs, represents an uncertain or imaginary action, or a statement of possibility, desire, ability, or futurity. While these categories are not perfect or definitive, they help to identify the general kinds of speech describing actions. We summarize and provide examples for the two-level AEO characterization system in Table 1.</p>
<p>Two-level AEO Characterization System with ExamplesCategoriesExamplesAgencyActiveI removed the yellow patch.PassiveI was shipped to Auschwitz.CoerciveMy father had to leave his home.SpeculativeThey could consummate the terrible deed.EvaluationI am not ashamed.OrientationI remembered a Christian woman.<br>
The Triplets AEO Algorithm implements the above process as a basic characterization system. In SpaCy, the algorithm takes tokens consisting of the Relation Verb Chunks,R, and Object Noun Chunks,O. For each token in bothRandO, there is retrievable syntactic information including (but not limited to) a part of speech (POS) tag, a dependency tag, and the lemma form of the word. We then put together this lexicon- and rule-based mechanism as shown in Appendix I, Algorithm 1.</p>
<h2 id="33-characterization-perpetrators-victims-and-others-pvo-categories">3.3 Characterization: Perpetrators, Victims, and Others (PVO) Categories</h2>
<p>The tripartite approach to characterizing victims, perpetrators, and bystanders has been around for decades in Holocaust historiography<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hilberg1992"> [hilberg1992] </a>. While not absolute or unproblematic, we strive to disambiguate subjects and objects in triplets when they are identified as people or groups. To do so, we first used the Entity Recognition pre-trained models in SpaCy to determine the category of a NOUN (people, organizations, geographic locations, and so forth). We, then, manually classified the detectable entities, where possible, into victim and perpetrator groups. For example, the phrasesthe German Army,the SS,orthe Gestapoare detected as organizations and marked as Perpetrator, whereas the interviewee (Iandwe) as well as familial units (parents, grandparents, sister, brother, and so forth) are marked as Victim. Pronouns, however, were not disambiguated. This classification method will always be incomplete, as many subjects and objects do not unequivocally belong to the victim or perpetrator group. Thegray zonecontains bystanders, aid-providers,implicated subjects,and people who moved across categories and do not easily fit the binary (<a class="footnote-ref" href="#rothberg2019"> [rothberg2019] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#luft2015"> [luft2015] </a>). These and other such subjects and objects are also extracted but not categorized, as they demand human scrutiny of context and, indeed, prompt further questions and future research about the range of agents in an oral history. For the ones that are certain, we created lists of victim and perpetrator lemmas, which provided the base forms of the entity words in the triplets.</p>

</figure>
<p>In Figure 3, we show statistical summaries of the triplets in each of the four testimonies. The triplets were algorithmically generated from the transcripts, assigned categories by speech type, and evaluated for accuracy. The size of each pie chart is scaled to the number of triplets extracted for each testimony. Boder’s interviews are shorter than the Shoah Foundation interviews (and, of course, end in 1946, rather than the 1990s). Due to the large number of triplets, we needed to develop ways to categorize and cluster the results. This entailed categorizing the triplets into six types of speech, assigning Victim and Perpetrator identities to certain subjects and objects, and experimenting with using a Wordnet-based characterization of the objects to cluster them by lemma and categories.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> For our initial version of the triplet extraction process, 6.5% of the triplets were manually corrected due to incorrect or incomplete subjects, verb relations, or objects. In addition, about 14% were manually removed from the original output because the triplet did not make sense grammatically or was misidentified as a triplet. The challenges and shortcomings of the triplet extraction process are discussed in section 5.2. To better analyze the triplets and their characterization, we created an interactive Triplets Dashboard, shown in Figure 4, which brings together the corrected triplets output, an object lemmas bubble plot, and multiple other filters.</p>
<p>As a finding aid, the dashboard helps us query and sort the triplets by interview, subject, object, speech type, and more. In the dashboard, a search for semantic triplets can be initiated on any term, category, or type of speech both within a given testimony or across a group of testimonies. In the screenshot, we see the triplets around Bassfreund’s description of his deportation from Berlin to his selection for forced labor in Auschwitz. They evidence a wide-range of speech acts, including active speech about other people’s agency ( “they gave us six slices” and “they placed a can” ), passive speech ( “we were put on trains” and “we were driven out of the cars” ), coercive speech ( “we had to sign affidavits” and “we have to leave Germany” ), speculative speech ( “I shall never forget those screams” ), evaluation ( “it was uncomfortable” and “the screams were terrible” ), and orientation ( “I have forgotten something” and “the people had a premonition” ). Looking further at the contextual information for the coerced action of being forced to sign affidavits, for example, we see the following terms: “our disloyalty,”  “Germany,”  “account,” and “hostility.” The original sentence can be seen on the far right of the triplet output, as translated by Boder: “Before being sent away, we had to sign affidavits that we have to leave Germany on account of our disloyalty and hostility to Germany.” <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p>

<p>Another way triplets can be used is to identify instances of different types of speech within a testimony. For example, leading up to and following his description of being deported to Auschwitz, we can visualize all the passive and coercive statements made by Bassfreund in whichIorweis the subject. As shown in Figure 5, there are over 50 such instances of passive and coercive speech described in this section of his interview with Boder (about ten type-written pages). Bassfreund emphasizes, with precise language, what was done to him and the Jewish community by the Nazis (we were surrounded, taken, moved, driven out, loaded on, led to, rubbed with, shoved into, sent into, transferred to) as well as what was specifically done to him (I was forcibly taken, assigned, sent, transferred).<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

</figure>
<p>We can now show our approach to semantic triplets extends and deepens topical indexing by pairing the triplets with the human-created indexing terms. As developed by both Boder and the Shoah Foundation, we see a significant continuity in terms of topics and themes (places, time periods, people, conditions, and events) used to index the testimonies. For instance, on pages 292-293 of Bassfreund’s testimony in <em>Topical Autobiographies</em> , Boder indexed the testimony with the following terms: bathing, clothing, hair cutting and shaving, professional criminals, confiscations, punishments, and tattoos. Similarly, in segment 25 of Bass’ testimony, we see the following indexing terms from the Shoah Foundation: Auschwitz I (Poland: Concentration Camp), camp forced labor, camp latrines, camp living conditions, camp selections, Poland 1941 (June 21) - 1945 (May 7), prisoner hair cutting forced labor, transfer from Auschwitz III-Monowitz (Poland: Concentration Camp), and transfer to Auschwitz I (Poland: Concentration Camp). While these topics certainly give us guidance for finding the overarching places, dates, conditions in captivity, movement, and forced labor, the indexing is not at the level of sentences or clauses and, therefore, we do not really know what Bassfreund/Bass did or what was done to him. As we see in Figure 6, we produce a corresponding network of just a few of the triplets derived from these specific parts of his testimonies. The interrelated set of triplets provide information about un-indexed subjects and agents (both victims and perpetrators), un-indexed actions (written on, picked up by, worked in, filled, sent), and un-indexed objects (the formation, their stomach, a truck, the crematories, human hair, mattresses, packages, and a mountain). Altogether, they point us toward ways of using the extracted semantic triplets to read, mark-up, and index testimonies by including microhistorical accounts of actions by both victims and perpetrators.</p>

<p>In the next section, we discuss some of the applications of the triplets to identifying acts of resistance, detecting unindexed stories, and analyzing larger semantic networks.</p>
<h2 id="41-microhistorical-acts-of-resistance">4.1 Microhistorical Acts of Resistance</h2>
<p>While large-scale acts of resistance (such as the Warsaw Ghetto uprising or the Sonderkommando rebellion in Auschwitz) are rightly known, there has been comparatively less appreciation of the range of everyday, seemingly ordinary acts of resistance by individuals. One historian who is working at the vanguard of this reappraisal of Jewish agency is Wolf Gruner, who has delved into numerous police and municipal archives in Germany to uncover the wide-range of acts of defiance, opposition, and protest by Jews living in Nazi Germany (<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gruner2011"> [gruner2011] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gruner2016b"> [gruner2016b] </a>). In his studies of “microhistories,” he has unearthed thousands of examples of Jews mounting both formal and informal protest, ranging from the filing of petitions and government complaints to outright acts of defiance, such as sitting on benches markedAryan onlyor refusing to use the forced middle name ofIsraelorSara,to physical and armed resistance against Nazi officials<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gruner2016a"> [gruner2016a] </a>. For our purposes here, we are interested in using our computational method of identifying networks of semantic triplets to find underappreciated or largely unknown acts of everyday resistance within Holocaust testimonial narratives. Our argument is that triplets point to a wide-range of small-scale actions that would otherwise go unremarked, since they do not, generally speaking, rise to the level of what might be indexed asacts of resistance.Oftentimes, these actions are not even considered to beindexable content,and thus they are extremely difficult to locate.</p>
<h2 id="411-example-1-anna-kovitzka">4.1.1 Example 1: Anna Kovitzka</h2>
<p>Interviewed by Boder in 1946, Anna Kovitzka’s story is particularly poignant, as she describes the violent separation and loss of her family and, in particular, her efforts to save her baby girl who was born in the Grodno ghetto. With her husband, she managed to escape the ghetto in the hopes of finding someone to care for her child. Shortly after giving up the child to a Christian woman who promised to protect her, Kovitzka was deported to Auschwitz. The child, unfortunately, did not survive as the Christian woman was denounced for trying to protect a Jewish baby. Examining the indexing terms used by Boder to mark-up her testimony, we see a wide-range of themes and topics, including: geographic locations (Wiesbaden, Kielce, Grodno, Slonim, Lvov, and Auschwitz), living conditions and objects (epidemics, starvation, thirst, illness, sleeping accommodations, and clothing), people (children, Gestapo, Prisoners-of-War, family, and Gypsies), and events (looting, childbirth, burials, flight, killings, escapes, work, bathing, rebellion, and appells or roll calls in camps). The last group of events certainly raises questions about actions, but without further analysis, we cannot know who was looting, escaping, working, rebelling, or even giving birth to a child. Moreover, without delving into the testimony, we cannot uncover specific vectors of agency (such as who did what, how did they do it, and to whom).</p>
<p>By examining the semantic triplets around the topical indexing termescapes,we can illuminate the specific agency described by Kovitzka in this part of her testimony (Table 2). The triplets indicate the actions of Kovitzka and her husband to escape the ghetto in order to save their child: “went over” the wires, “set up a chair,”  “raised” the wire, “went out” on the street, “removed” the yellow patch, and, finally, “went down” the street. In each case, we see active speech describing a set of actions that occurred in the context of escaping the ghetto, even after she reports that sixteen Jews were killed at the gate in a first attempt to escape. While this section of the text is indexed by Boder asescapes,curfew,fences,andyellow star,the actual acts of escaping the ghetto through the wires, removing the yellow Star of David, and going down the street represent acts of resistance and agency that can be successfully detected and added to the index through computational text analysis attuned to semantic triplets.<br>

Using the dashboard to search on the objectchildin Kovitzka’s testimony reveals a number of triplets that show her attempts to save her child and, ultimately, the child’s fate: “I must save my child,”  “My man handed the child,”  “she has taken my child,”  “she had picked up the child,”  “I don’t have my child,”  “she kept the child,”  “she loved the child,”  “my child was lying on the snow,” and “they buried the child.” The tragedy of Kovitzka’s loss of her child forms the traumatic core of her testimony and, yet, there is barely any indication of this from the indexing terms. The creation of a semantic network around the termchildwould help us locate and appreciate these critical actions and thus begin to index the testimony attuned to expressions of agency (Figure 7).</p>

<h2 id="412-example-2-erika-jacoby">4.1.2 Example 2: Erika Jacoby</h2>
<p>After being deported to Auschwitz and separated from her grandparents on the arrival ramp, Jacoby and her mother are selected for the slave labor camp. Their heads are shaven; they are deloused for lice; and they are given meager clothes. Most of Jacoby’s testimony, then, focuses on everyday life in Auschwitz, including forced labor, sleeping conditions, food rations, violence, and abuse. While the associated triplets bear witness to her struggle for survival, our indexing of agency in Jacoby’s testimony also included the following groups of triplets. As shown in Table 3, after one passive construction, we see five successive, active constructions and one triplet characterized asorientation(considered as information to the interviewer).<br>

This utterly astonishing action is not marked up or identified in any way through the Shoah Foundation’s topical indexing. In fact, there is no word search that will find this part of her testimony. Jacoby relays the story in just a dozen sentences, comprising about 50 seconds of her two-hour testimony. And yet it is a stunning act of defiance, risk, and agency.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of the testimony with a little bit of context to set up the scene and reflect on its meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We stayed six weeks in Auschwitz. We had many, many interesting events that happened to us in Auschwitz. I just want to tell you one that was very important. And I don’t think I have time to describe Auschwitz. And I’m sure that it’s well known. But we were– one, one day, we were taken to a bath. We were taken to a bath about once a week or once every other week. And as we were marching, we were go– we were going by a German officer’s area. And I saw a swimming pool. And I jumped out of the line, and I dove into the swimming pool. And I swam across the pool, and I got back. And they didn’t shoot me, and I survived. But of course, my mother almost died. I mean, it was such an irr– irresponsible act from my part. But I was young, and I, I needed to be alive. And I did that.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jacoby1994"> [jacoby1994] </a><br>
Indeed, there were twopoolson the grounds of Auschwitz: one for prisoners and one for SS officers, near blocks 7 and 8. They were built as reservoirs to store water rather than be used for recreational swimming. Today, a sign clarifies the remains of the structure: “Fire brigade reservoir built in the form of a swimming pool, probably in early 1944.” When Jacoby arrived in Auschwitz in the summer of 1944, the pool would have been complete. The Shoah Foundation manually tagged these segments of Jacoby’s testimony with the following keywords:camp intake procedures,camp prisoner marking,camp family interactions,loved ones’ contacts,prisoner external contact, and a single person tag, her mother, Malvina Salamonovits. Judging by these tags, one might expect her discussion to focus on procedural elements of the camp, perhaps coupled with how she and her mother survived together. There is nothing in the indexing that would indicate jumping out line, diving into the pool, and swimming across. While we can certainly read or hear Jacoby talking about this experience if we happened to land on this part of her testimony, it remains <em>an unindexed action</em> , which otherwise submerges a significant act of resistance and agency. Through the computational extraction of triplets, we can index, hone in on, and appreciate this defiant act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Auschwitz is liberated by the Soviet army, Jacoby relays that she and her mother left the camp in search of food and safety from sexual assaults by Russian soldiers. Over the next three and a half minutes (1:18-1:21), she describes a set of actions that helped her and her mother survive. She also tells of acts of revenge and anger committed by her 16-year-old self. Two of the three segments are tagged by the Shoah Foundation asfood acquisitionandlooting(the third is not tagged at all). These topical terms convey little about the agency involved and the kinds of actions that a listener may want to search for and find in her testimony. In Table 4, we reproduce the full set of 23 semantic triplets that our methodology identified over these three minutes. All forms of agency are included as well as all subjects and objects. Thewesubject refers to Erika and her mother.</p>
<p>Whilefood acquisitionandlootingare indexing terms that signal the overall set of content, these terms tell us nothing specific about what Erika and her mother did in the days after liberation; they tell us nothing about the vectors of agency and reasons for their actions; and they tell us none of the details of the actions conveyed in her testimony. And perhaps more pointedly, the indexing terms tend to obscure more than they reveal: Far from abstract topics,food acquisitioninvolved the specific act of stealing and eating a pig (a non-kosher act of desperation for survival), whilelootingwas connected to Jacoby’s immediate post-War actions, which reflect personal anger, acts of revenge, and the longing for a normal life.

<h2 id="5-discussion-limitations-and-new-work">5 Discussion, Limitations, and New Work</h2>
<p>Although our process of extracting and characterizing triplets creates new paratexts that enhance our interpretation and ability to index testimonies by descriptions of agency, there are a number of limitations and shortcomings. The major issue is thatsemantic triplets– strictly speaking as subjects, verb relations, and objects – can oversimplify narrative expressivity when truncated, extracted, or decontextualized. Below, we will identify and discuss a number of limitations as well as discuss how our newer,meticuloustriplet extraction process (version 2.0) addresses some of those problems.</p>
<h2 id="51-considering-coreferences-pronoun-disambiguation-and-entity-linking">5.1 Considering Coreferences: Pronoun Disambiguation and Entity Linking</h2>
<p>As is evident in many of the triplets, pronouns often exist in subjects and objects, and they are sometimes ambiguous. For example, there are multiple references tohe,she,they,orthemwhere the pronoun could refer to a perpetrator in one line but a victim in the following. Thus, a coreferencing solution for the triplets needs to disambiguate pronouns or, at the very least, link triplets together such that the coreference can be clearly identified. We experimented with using NeuralCoref, a coreference resolution python package which annotates and resolves coreference clusters using a neural network<a class="footnote-ref" href="#huggingface2019"> [huggingface2019] </a>. However, this pre-trained language model is based on out-of-domain text data, and it is only effective about half the time, which is not precise enough for our needs.</p>
<p>Thus, we are working on creating our own model of coreferencing for use in Holocaust and genocide testimonies. This close-domain model was initially trained by annotating testimonies using BRAT, a web-based annotation tool that allows customized labels for entities and coreferences<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stenetorpetal2012"> [stenetorpetal2012] </a>. Inspired by the annotation process of entities and coreferences in an English literature dataset, we will use a customized set of entity types, including named people, groups, communities, as well as other regular named-entities like organizations and geo-political entities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bammanetal2019"> [bammanetal2019] </a>. Our hope is that the training model, derived from a diverse set of annotated Holocaust testimonies, will help us disambiguate pronouns throughout a corpus.</p>
<h2 id="52-revisiting-the-chunk-method-a-moremeticuloustriplet-extraction-process">5.2 Revisiting the Chunk Method: A MoreMeticulousTriplet Extraction Process</h2>
<p>Our chunk-based triplets extraction method is certainly not flawless. One challenge is that important expressions that are not triplets are simply not found (for instance, “we were separated” ). Another challenge is how to capture fuller object phrases and distinguish direct and indirect objects. In this version, we capture both, and usually the direct object is part of the triplet and the indirect object is part of the contextual information; in the moremeticulousversion, we capture fuller object phrases by extracting from thecontextas much as possible. Although the objects tend to be longer, they are more complete and integrate the contextual elements within the object phrase itself. This newer version results in both more triplets being extracted and higher accuracy.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>An ongoing challenge, however, concerns certain sentences with dependent, relative, or conditional clauses, which are not always captured completely or may be broken apart in the course of the chunk method. This problem can be seen withif, thenstatements or ones that begin with a form of negation. For example, this sentence spoken by Bassfreund, is turned into three triplets: “And it was already night and the SS opened the doors and said if we throw out the dead bodies we shall get some food.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bassfreund1946"> [bassfreund1946] </a>Getting food from the SS is dependent upon the victims being forced to throw out dead bodies from the train. Although the triplets are captured individually, maintaining the specific contingency of the actions and understanding the reasons for them requires human review and interpretation.</p>
<p>While network analysis may give rise to new narrative orderings that allow us to see relationships across a testimony or corpus, we also preserve the narrative sequence of the triplets in our extraction process since the context for a triplet certainly matters both within an individual sentence and between sentences. For instance, when Bass says: “Well, you could tell. These guys were very rough and very bad. They used to beat you up, and scream, and holler, and push you. And hit you with a– a rubber– piece of rubber there. It looked like a rubber hose.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bass1997"> [bass1997] </a>Our triplet extraction method maintains the contiguity between the description of the men (former criminals who the Nazis put in place as supervisors in camps) so that the last triplet ( “it looked like a rubber hose” ) continues to make sense within this context. Sequential groupings are one way to maintain narrative continuity.</p>
<p>Another basic challenge that we face is extracting triplets from fragmented, vernacular speech, which the process often has trouble parsing. Survivors sometimes switch from first-person narration to second or third-person; sometimes the sentences contain incomplete thoughts, repetitions, or stuttering; sometimes the transcribed sentence lacks regular punctuation; and sometimes survivors quote the speech of others directly or indirectly. The triplet extraction process has no way of telling if a triplet refers to the quoted or attributed speech of someone else. For example, Anna Kovitzka says: “Once my man said: I can’t make peace with them. Our child must be saved even if we two shall die. ” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#kovitzka1946"> [kovitzka1946] </a>While two triplets are extracted ( “I can’t make peace with them” and “our child must be saved” ), the triplets are not attributed to her husband because the phrase “once my man said” is not part of either triplet.</p>
<p>To take another example: In his interview with Boder, Bassfreund says: “We were rubbed with kerosene” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bassfreund1946"> [bassfreund1946] </a>with respect to the delousing process in Auschwitz. That triplet is easily found; however, in his later interview with the Shoah Foundation, he says: “And then they did some – used some kind of delousing agent, they poured all over us.” No triplets were found in the first version of our process, as the sentence is spoken with breaks that less clearly connect the subject (they) to the verbs and objects. To address this, ourmeticulousversion of triplet extraction is based on a set of finer-defined, semantic rules to extract noun and verb chunks. To make chunks include more contextual information and complete grammatical structures, we add a layer in between the sentence and chunk levels, which we call thesegment level,for chunk-boundary decision making, as shown in Figure 8. Even though the sentence is not grammatically correct, the new extraction method is able to find the triplets in this sentence, while the previous approach was not. And although some objects and object phrases become longer than expected, we can now extract a more complete context for the objects of a triplet. We are also experimenting with categorizing object phrases based on semantic features like word lemmas, WordNet synsets, and dependency parsing, which will create more filters for large scale triplets retrieval.</p>

<h2 id="53-other-improvements-and-potential-applications">5.3 Other Improvements and Potential Applications</h2>
<p>Based on the indexing and analysis of agency in the four example testimonies discussed here, we have applied ourmeticulousmethod to over a thousand Holocaust testimonies. The output creates a new paratext of triplets for each interview and provides a set of additional metadata that can be queried, indexed, and overlaid on existing metadata. The triplets are intended to function as finding aids to supplement the original text by providing a new set of metadata attuned to articulations of agency. One of the promising directions is to queryshared experiences(such as reports of and responses to discrimination) across a corpus using the semantic triplets. What, for example, did hundreds of different witnesses say about their memories of discrimination during the 1930s and early 40s and how did they describe their individual reactions? How many other people remember removing the yellow star from their clothes and what did they say they did next?</p>
<p>Going forward, we hope to create a better finding aid and scaled-up visualization tool, perhaps through an indexing dashboard supported by a triplets database. Researchers can then query and visualize through the same interface to find semantic triplets and generate associated networks. This interactive dashboard could combine the flexibility of curation in the Triplets Dashboard in Tableau with a Neo4j Network Visualization Dashboard. At the same time, we are continuing to explore how searching foragencywithin a narrative can complement standard thematic and topical searches through network clustering and category clustering of triplets.</p>
<h2 id="6-conclusion">6 Conclusion</h2>
<p>Semantic triplets are a text immanent way to computationally identify and index descriptions of agency within oral histories. While conventional indexing is important for finding overarching themes and topics, it relies on the creation of a secondary scaffolding for searching within the testimonies, almost always attuned to named entities, topics, and general themes. Indexing semantic triplets, on the other hand, is primarily an algorithmic approach to identify specific expressions of agency and their lexical context from transcripts. As such, we are able to link and analyze multiple vectors of action and attune our reading and listening to networks of agents, relations, objects, and contexts. Our approach always relies on and is derived from the interviewee’s spoken (and transcribed) language. In this regard, it is a kind ofalgorithmic close readingbuilt on a paratext derived from the original transcript. Althoughdistant readingremains a powerful approach for statistically summarizing the content of a corpus, digital humanities scholars have also warned against the seduction ofdelegating observationanddelegating interpretationto machines<a class="footnote-ref" href="#underwood2019"> [underwood2019] </a>. In many ways, semantic triplets use some of the algorithmic tools of distant reading (large-scale text analysis attuned to patterns, classifications, and clusters) to enable humans to undertake close readings and perform interpretative queries. It is up to us to figure out the meaning or significance of any description of agency in the context of an oral history or corpus.</p>
<p>In this sense, our approach is also quite different from current machine learning methods for information extraction systems. Although seemingly unpopular these days from a natural language processing perspective, a fully rule-based and easily interpretable system works well for our purposes of triplets extraction and analysis. We can describe the algorithms we use based on conditional statements and clear rules for additional human curation and correction. Computational indexing of agency shifts the scale of analysis to individual mentions of agency and interconnected actions, helping us read and listen to testimonies in ways that deepen our understanding of what people report they did and what was done to them.</p>

<p>We shape our tools and thereafter they shape us.<br>
—John Culkin<a href="#culkin1967">1967, 70</a><br>
In reflecting on the fraught disciplinary boundaries of the digital humanities, Lauren Klein and Matthew Gold write, “In what has been called ‘big tent’ DH, it can at times be difficult to determine with any specificity what, precisely, digital humanities work entails” [<a href="#gold2016">2016, intro.</a>]<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> . As with any definitional ambiguity, others have sought to demarcate such boundaries, suggesting models, imperatives, and ontologies for DH work. Some researchers claim that DH is not the “mere use of digital tools for the purpose of humanistic research” or the “study of digital artifacts, new media, or contemporary culture” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2012"> [burdick2012] </a>. Indeed, in positing a “generative humanities” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2012"> [burdick2012] </a>or a “critical digital humanities” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#berry2017"> [berry2017] </a>or any number of distinctions and prerogatives within DH work (while maintaining that the work should be interdisciplinary, collaborative, and exploratory), the field both narrows to fit framedpurposesand expands with the radical possibilities of productive practices and processes. In their latest reflection on the discipline, Klein and Gold revise their notion of DH as anexpanded field— “a set of vectors of inquiry that are defined by their tensions, alignments, and oppositions” — in order to argue for a DHthat matters,one which incorporatessocially oriented workand translates the “subtleties of our research to others within the expanded field” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gold2019"> [gold2019] </a>. My own experience, coming from a background in sociology yet watching the confluence of DH techniques and analyses with once-strictly anthropological or sociological research, is indicative of how fraught any attempt to coherently standardize such work is. And so, without arguing for any authoritative boundaries within DH, it is important to instead characterize thevector of inquirythat I engage with, positioning my project within the field by way of useful but ultimately unsustainable distinctions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This project is rooted in the principles ofcritical design;that is, as a project in which I am producing a digital tool, I am taking a critical, self-reflective approach to my design process that interrogates the theoretical underpinnings of my design decisions, an approach I am terming “reflexive critical design” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bardzell2013"> [bardzell2013] </a>. This specific distinction is necessary, as born from this approach is what I termexperimental critical design,a mode of both sociological and DH research that looks at the potential for interrogating digital tools as theories about the social world. Experimental critical design recognizes the ability of digital tools to do more than just analyze data but to produce data; moreover, it sees these digital tools (and thus the theories underpinning them) to be data. After developing a framework for critical design, firmly positioning this work within a specific vector of inquiry, I will describe the digital project that I have made centered around network visualization and then analyze it through the lens of this critical design framework.</p>
<p>In short, my digital project “Loss” examines how increasingly popular and accessible network visualizations can be used to visualize networks of loss — that is, the networks of things attached to a focal object removed from a system. Leveraging the fundamentals of web design and the data analysis library D3<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bostock2019"> [bostock2019] </a>, I developed an online web interface that asks users to meditate on what loss and removal can mean for their personal lives, history, or society — and then visualize these effects through a series of connected nodes. From the perspective of reflexive critical design, I use this project to examine the question: how does the creation of a digital tool reflect a theoretical interpretation of the social world and its processes? And in developing experimental critical design, I seek to answer the question: how can the interpretive social theories behind this digital tool themselves constitute the data of sociological studies? Both questions call for a sociological analysis of the tools and methods that DH is producing right now, but they also call for a pedagogical and ethical approach to DH work: As the field grows — and interdisciplinary boundaries become even more fraught — DH can provide valuable insight into how digital methods can be leveraged to address social, cultural, and personal issues that extend far beyond the typicalbig dataapproach to digital tools. DH can work towards an educative, public engagement to collaborate with a general population increasingly engaged with digital media. Together, the two critical design perspectives recognize critical design as theory, experiment, and data: designs constitute a social theory, data can be experimentally produced within this social theory, and encouraging reflective design can turn the social theories of design themselves into data.</p>
<h2 id="reflexive-and-experimental-critical-design-a-sociologically-informed-approach">Reflexive and Experimental Critical Design: A Sociologically-Informed Approach</h2>
<p>David Berry and Anders Fagerjord argue for acritical reflexivity<a class="footnote-ref" href="#berry2017"> [berry2017] </a>in DH, one in which researchers treat their work as more than just functional but theoretical as well. As digital methods proliferate, especially in terms of their accessibility, the dangers of a lack of reflexivity are evident in projects — amateurish or professional — that misinterpret the output, logic, or purpose of the digital tools that they wield. Indeed, the fetishization of digital methods — many of which come from or overlap with methods used in the social sciences and corporate sector — has allowed for an overvaluation or misinterpretation of data- and computer-driven analyses<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cheneylippold2017"> [cheneylippold2017] </a>. In some of the most extreme cases, these digital methods have reproduced a digital phrenology, or they have been leveraged by malicious actors such as conspiracy theorists to allow for thescientizationof misinformation and hate towards harmful political ends<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cct2020"> [cct2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#uscinski2018"> [uscinski2018] </a>. This is not to say there has not been reflection on these risks: a recent viral project from science and technologies studies researchers Kate Crawford and Trevor Paglen [<a href="#crawford2019">2019</a>] blended machine learning and facial recognition software in an attempt to demonstrate the inherent racial biases in datasets, machine vision, and algorithms — digital tools which power commercial products or even the work of police departments and high school administrations<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ferguson2016"> [ferguson2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#oneil2016"> [oneil2016] </a>. Nevertheless, the blind implementation of digital tools means that tools must be understood for their potential consequences, perhaps even designed to prevent abuse by bad actors. DH as a whole can look to engage with and produce work that reimagines digital tools as something less-than-empirical and objective — the product of human impulses and understandings of the world, rooted both in individuals’ biases, motivations, and ideologies. Moreover, these reimagined tools can then be turned inwards, to examine the self rather than the troves of ethically-dubious data now enrapturing researchers and celebrating the eclectic categorization and algorithmic analysis of theother<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cheneylippold2017"> [cheneylippold2017] </a>.</p>
<p>It is only with strict interrogation of digital tools and methodologies that DH can move beyond producinginstrumentaltools that say something about inputted data and instead produce tools that say something about the world itself as it is being transformed and interpreted by technology — tools that are, in their own right, theories about the social world<a class="footnote-ref" href="#berry2017"> [berry2017] </a>. Thus, I position myself in a critical DH, one that investigates the theoretical underpinnings of the employed methods and treats digital tools as theories themselves. In this work, the object of my criticism is what digital humanists termdesign:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…design is a creative practice harnessing cultural, social, economic, and technological constraints in order to bring systems and objects into the world. Design in dialogue with research is simply a technique, but when used to pose and frame questions about knowledge, design becomes an intellectual method. In the hundred-plus years during which a self-conscious practice of design has existed, the field has successfully exploited technology for cultural production, either as useful design technologies in and of themselves, or by shaping the culture’s technological imaginary. As Digital Humanities both shapes and interprets this imaginary, its engagement with design as a method of thinking-through-practice is indispensable. Digital Humanities is a production-based endeavor in which theoretical issues get tested in the design of implementations, and implementations are loci of theoretical reflection and elaboration<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2012"> [burdick2012] </a>.<br>
In short, in the world of DH, design is a technological approach to representations of the world which necessarily implements (and tacitly argues for) a theory about the world. My work here is thuscritical design,a reflexive interrogation of the theories underpinning the design I am attempting to implement in addition to the design itself as it is used to argue for a particular representation of the world. This reflexive critical design asks the designer to examine their own latent motivations, ideologies, and biases; examine how these have been translated into the design; and examine design itself as an act and as a principle. Reflexivity about research methods and approaches is certainly nothing new in the humanities, especially as critical race theory and gender theory have tasked readers with examining their implicit biases before engaging with literary material<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wernimont2010"> [wernimont2010] </a>, or decolonial theories have argued for an archaeology in which researchers examine their position more deeply within field sites<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stobiecka2020"> [stobiecka2020] </a>. Social science’s more explicit historical focus onmethodsadds to this conversation by viewing approaches to research questions and data — such as literary works or archaeological sites — as methods guided by a particular point-of-view and sociological interpretation<a class="footnote-ref" href="#weber2017"> [weber2017] </a>. Further, with the proliferation of media studies in the social sciences, critical voices have asked for a deeper examination of our sudden reification of tools that many people assume to function without the bias of theold ways<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When working across academic registers, it’s important to establish a shared vocabulary: in this instance,designis a capacious term, as it can refer to both the design of a study — from the social scientific lexicon — or the design of a computational tool. In both cases, design is united by its generativeprocedures.That is to say, when approaching a research question with a dataset, both the research design and the computational design are guided by a procedural logic that makes arguments about how the social world functions — but in DH work, research design often <em>is</em> computational design, as the research methods are not distinct from the tool itself. Thus, we can enlistdesignas the term capturing the procedural logic of computational tools which themselves constitute the research design. Procedural arguments, or procedural rhetoric, consist of “the art of persuasion through rule-based representations and interactions, rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bogost2007"> [bogost2007] </a>. Therefore, to analyze the procedural rhetoric of DH designs is to recognize that systems and processes function as a form of discursive argumentation as much as traditionally understood argumentation in the form of writing and imagery, with computational designs increasingly coming under scrutiny from thecritical codingperspective — what are the latent arguments built into software’s code<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2012"> [burdick2012] </a>? Not only does software’s coded procedures make arguments about the social world, they do so at the behest of programmers and with the illusion of objectivity. In short, this paper views design as a set of theoretically-informed, argumentative procedures built into digital tools. Moreover, because these digital procedures seek to generate, capture, or analyze data, their underlying theories shape <em>how</em> data is generated, captured, or analyzed.</p>
<p>An example of how some social science researchers have critically studied their tools to see their latent biases can help to elucidate the reflexive critical design perspective I’ve outlined above: In the aforementioned facial recognition project by<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crawford2019"> [crawford2019] </a>, the researchers began with a set of research questions, “What work do images do in AI systems? What are computers meant to recognize in an image and what is misrecognized or even completely invisible?” In their case: what biases are baked into a software’s procedures for recognizing faces? Their next step required choosing a dataset to train their AI system, and, when critiquing one dataset representing human emotions, they were aware of the arguments implicitly made by the dataset’s taxonomical procedures, writing, “First there’s the taxonomy itself: that ‘emotions’ is a valid set of visual concepts. Then there’s a string of additional assumptions: that the concepts within ‘emotions’ can be applied to photographs of people’s faces” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#crawford2019"> [crawford2019] </a>. When they chose a different dataset for their work, the data’s taxonomical procedures allowed them to “see the outlines of a worldview” as it “classifie[d] people into a huge range of types including race, nationality, profession, economic status, behaviour, character, and even morality” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#crawford2019"> [crawford2019] </a>. That they would create a machine vision tool intended to classify people based on their physical appearances meant that their tool advocated for the worldview tacit to the data; it posited a social theory of what the categories ofpeoplewere, that these were appropriate categories to use, and that a person’s categories were latent to their physical appearance — what does it mean to look like akleptomaniacor apervert<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crawford2019"> [crawford2019] </a>? Crawford and Paglen’s work demonstrated that both the dataset and the facial recognition software could not function without tacitly making arguments about how the social world functions — how human biases about physical appearances were translated into computational procedures, argued for by those procedures.</p>
<p>Reflexive critical design allows us to see the latent motivations, ideologies, and biases inherent to the computational processes that constitute DH’s research tools. These computational processes work in service of aworldview,social theory, or, to use the language of computer science, a model of the social world. The procedures that classify images make an argument about essential human traits whereas natural language processing procedures might make an argument about prescriptive grammar or semantics, and GIS procedures might make an argument about national territories or land ownership. In any case, without critical examination, these digital tools simply perpetuate the worldview that constructed them, and so long as they produce data that people find worthwhile, their latent biases can go uninterrogated.</p>
<p>Further, reflexive critical design allows for experimentation that creates data. For example, in Crawford and Paglen’s project, the researchers could leverage the outputs of their facial recognition software, as it was used by people online, to make an argument about racism in digital technology. They made their digital tool accessible, allowing users to submit their own photos and put the machine’s social theories to the test. In taking a critical approach to design that gave them an intimate knowledge of their software — and the inherent racial biases it modeled — they were better equipped to critique its output. Crucially, reflexive critical design’s capacity for experimentation negotiates between historical modes of criticism and emergent forms of “critical making” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#jagoda2017"> [jagoda2017] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#ratto2011"> [ratto2011] </a>. Crawford and Paglen began with a traditional critique but then put this critique into productive action. This resulted in a project that allowed users to experientially engage with the critique, affectively understanding how technology discriminates when pictures of themselves were labelled with racist and sexist slurs. It was an experiment in digital design which merged criticism with critical making, a merger that is increasingly familiar to social scientists: in sociologist Chris Bail’s work on political polarization, his team created a social media app that put two politically-opposed members into a chatroom where they could discuss a given political issue anonymously<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bail2021"> [bail2021] </a>. In this case, a social theory about anonymity, discursive identity, and political communication was proffered by the very processes of the app, one that could be tested by the app’s output in the form of textual exchanges. Social media apps are infrequently designed with such a sensitivity to social theory — as anthropologist Nick Seaver [<a href="#seaver2017">2017</a>] discusses, the logic of these platforms often reproduce taken-for-granted cultural norms or are uncritical about the ways their social engineering might affect people’s lives.</p>
<p>A disciplinary anxiety emerges: the artistry and accessibility of Crawford and Paglen’s work feels different than the social experimentation of Bail’s work — indeed, both are framed differently — but at the crux of their digital methods is a recognition that they are perpetuating a model of reality through procedural arguments that will result in some form of data that puts their model to the test, allowing for a deeper reflection on the software itself. These design procedures simultaneously function as research procedures, with designers acting as researchers inviting users (or subjects) to be subject to the digital design’s processes. Reflexive critical design is in direct opposition to the work of the corporate sector, where digital processes are deployed without reflecting on how those processes will affect human behavior, as the software’s functionality and profitability are the primary motivators, forcing the software’s underlying design logic to remain a trade secret<a class="footnote-ref" href="#oneil2016"> [oneil2016] </a>. What many researchers of media are doing now is seeing the resulting data of the mass social experiment that is the internet: the experimental critical design perspective challenges researchers to directly engage and design the methods that have created that data.</p>
<p>Finally, reflexive critical design itself constitutes data. There are a number of ways of thinking about how design can be used as data: First, the design’s procedures themselves, through a close-reading of the software’s code and processes<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2012"> [burdick2012] </a>, allows for an examination that can reveal the researcher or developer’s intentions and theoretical framing when they designed the software. This is similar to the work that Crawford and Paglen [<a href="#crawford2019">2019</a>] did when they critiqued theemotionsdataset: they drew out the social theories from <em>others’</em> procedural arguments. Now with countless computational models available online, systematic critical design is desperately needed to hold other researchers accountable<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cct2020"> [cct2020] </a>. Second, when researchers such as Crawford, Paglen, or Bail make their theoretical framing explicit — a much more common practice in the social sciences, where these authors come from — such justifications can be put in conversation with the software itself to examine how different researchers have theorized and employed models of the social world, as might be done in review papers. This is a challenge, considering how frequently digital tools are distributed with documentation focused solely on how to use the digital tool rather than how to understand the implications of its procedural arguments.</p>
<p>The final way that reflexive critical design can be seen as data is one that has rarely seen use in DH or the social sciences broadly. Researchers can task people with developing their own designs. Researchers can pose design challenges to participants in an attempt to see how they might conceptualize and procedurally argue for a model of the social world, and their procedural arguments constitute data to be analyzed. This sort of thinking has gained popularity in the world of urban planning, wheredesign challengescentered around tackling a central problem can be revealing of how participants in the design challenge think through social issues<a class="footnote-ref" href="#munster2017"> [munster2017] </a>. It has also been employed in relation to game design, with researchers and educators collaborating to assist youth in designing games that address salient social problems<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gilliam2016"> [gilliam2016] </a>. These designed games reflect both how the students think about systems functioning in their lives and how the medium — in this case, analog board games — constrain and shape their thinking in procedural ways. How people think about issues through software and digital processes, then, can be investigated, even if their designs are only manifest on paper or in interviews. The goal is not to design software but to understand how people <em>would</em> design software — how they procedurally argue for a particular representation of the world. Although, with the increased accessibility of digital tools and increasing digital literacy, some populations might be able to design simple games or programs articulating the dynamics of the social world through limited procedural techniques.</p>
<p>Critical, pedagogical, and generative approaches to game design bring the principles of reflexive and experimental critical design into greater relief. As seen in Gilliam et al.’s [<a href="#gilliam2016">2016</a>] board game design workshops, games have long been theorized to have the capacity to critique extant systems, teach new ways of thinking and acting, and produce information, data, and action<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gee2003"> [gee2003] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#mcgonigal2011"> [mcgonigal2011] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#schrier2016"> [schrier2016] </a>. Games are particularly in line with the move towards a DHthat matters,as Karen Schrier advocates for games that are “not just <em>for</em> change, they <em>are</em> change.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#schrier2016"> [schrier2016] </a>. Theorists and researchers tout recurring examples of games that were critically designed and then produced researchable behaviors through their procedures<a class="footnote-ref" href="#schrier2016"> [schrier2016] </a>. For example, a non-profit encouraged people to donate to those in financial straits by proceduralizing its worldview in a game: The game forced players into difficult financial decisions where sacrifice was necessary, attempting to demonstrate that poverty was not a fault of character but of oppressive systems<a class="footnote-ref" href="#mckinney2011"> [mckinney2011] </a>. Researchers then studied the emotions and ideas evoked by the game, which showed mixed success<a class="footnote-ref" href="#roussos2016"> [roussos2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#smith2016"> [smith2016] </a>. The game was reflexively designed — intended to be pedagogical and influence thought under a particular ideology — with experimental capabilities such that people could measure changes in sentiment or money donated. And it is a data point as one of many social change games or games about poverty, one way a theory of poverty has been turned into a digital procedure. It is a game as a theory, an experiment, and as data.</p>
<p>Many of those who advocate for games for social change place a great deal of emphasis on those procedural arguments — fixating on how <em>processes</em> and <em>mechanics</em> in games can bring people closer to one another, spark emotions that motivate, and literally perform research in the case of citizen scientist projects<a class="footnote-ref" href="#schrier2016"> [schrier2016] </a>. However, we know that faith in processes alone is dangerous, as the same processes that produce prosocial multiplayer environments in online games also allow for cultish groupthink and potential political radicalization, or fail to inspire empathy for the impoverished<a class="footnote-ref" href="#robinson2020"> [robinson2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#roussos2016"> [roussos2016] </a>. Ultimately, games represent one end of the design spectrum: As highly interactive, often immersive tools that make arguments about the social world through a battery of argumentative strategies such as narratives or gameplay mechanics, they often unintentionally produce ways for researchers to better understand human social dynamics in games that were designed for play and enjoyment. On the other end of the spectrum might be electronic medical records (EMR) software: while no one would beplayingon an EMR system, these interfaces have procedures that make arguments about their patients, medical hierarchies, and privacy — the push for health information exchange (HIE) software which allows for the sharing of relevant data across health and non-health entities such as food banks is reflective of a critical approach to health care software design that implicitly argues for health systems which address social determinants of health and gives patients more agency over their data<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kaelber2007"> [kaelber2007] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#rudin2014"> [rudin2014] </a>. Between the engaging world of games and the bureaucratic world of management software, there are any number of digital tools which can be critically examined and designed to more intentionally engage with the world we live in.</p>
<p>While design has always been focused on how best to analyze and represent data, critical design brings latent social and political questions to the forefront of the digital humanities, homing in on a DHthat matters<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gold2019"> [gold2019] </a>. Social scientists have long recognized the ways that worldviews and social theories are codified into research methods, and work in the social sciences (like that of Seaver or Bail) demonstrates how recent studies have had to contend with the socio-political implications of technology’s designs and procedures. Reflexive critical design tasks DH researchers and designers to think about how the tools they produce and the tools they use assist in the production of a political reality. Just as Google search indexes perpetuate racist worldviews through their treatment of racial and gender minorities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#noble2018"> [noble2018] </a>, DH researchers run the risk of creating tools — for academic or public use — that actively aid in the reification of a particular (and potentially dangerous) social theory. Reflexive critical design also opens up the pathway for experimental critical design: once a social theory has been established in a digital tool, how do the users of that tool engage with it to reproduce or subvert that worldview? Users — be they DH researchers or the public — create data under the framework provided by these tools, so their output enables the interrogation of the kinds of data the tool allows. This also allows reflexive critical design to understand technology <em>in its use</em> rather than just in concept. Moreover, by examining others’ computational models addressing shared research questions or by asking users how they would design a computational model to approach a research question, the social theories baked into procedures can themselves become data for comparative analysis. This final form of experimentation rests on the notion that people are innately theoretical beings, and they will try to translate their understanding of the world into procedures, as people do when designing systems in video games<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jagoda2020"> [jagoda2020] </a>or HIEs. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary approach recognizes that digital procedures increasingly govern the way that we interface with reality, and thus we need to critically design digital procedures — in DH tools, social science experiments, social media, games, and even health management software — that are honest about their procedures, allow their procedures to be tested, and look toward others to build better digital systems.</p>

<p>Recent trends in employment, education, and technology have made the promise of large scale data analysis a reality in a variety of industries and research areas, motivated in part by the profit to be had from data mining (with the oft-repeated assertion that data is the new oil), a budding career-oriented student body well-versed in technical skills, and the proliferation of open-source software that has made mathematically complex and technologically taxing data analysis accessible<a class="footnote-ref" href="#provost2013"> [provost2013] </a>. These innovations have come at a cost: setting aside the perennial fear that data analysis will strip more qualitatively-oriented humanities and social scientist researchers of job security, the acquisition of data for analysis raises ethical questions regarding individual privacy and rule by technology<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cheneylippold2017"> [cheneylippold2017] </a>. However, while the social harms of data harvesting are not to be downplayed, equally important is how that data is used. There are obvious cases of data abuse — such as city police departments that deploy racist policing algorithms or search algorithms that reiterate racist stereotypes about Black women — and then there are questions of manipulation, disinformation, and epistemology<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ferguson2016"> [ferguson2016] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#gottlieb2020"> [gottlieb2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#noble2018"> [noble2018] </a>.</p>
<p>Due to data science’s proliferation, open-access tools are more and more being leveraged by actors who don’t have a deep knowledge of the technology’s operations, let alone the statistical or social sciences background to put their results in context. In a time that has been labelled thepost-truth eraor “the Misinformation Age,” the threats posed by the — sometimes malicious, sometimes innocent — dissemination of false or misleading information can have damaging effects on public discourse, political organization, and national crises, a fact that became exceptionally clear throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic<a class="footnote-ref" href="#agerfalk2020"> [agerfalk2020] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#oconner2019"> [oconner2019] </a>. Considering how easily convinced people are by blatantly false and easily refutablescienceor news, any additional credibility granted to amateurish data engineers is in itself a heightened risk<a class="footnote-ref" href="#moravec2018"> [moravec2018] </a>. This project embraces and reimagines this criticism: on the one hand, it accepts that the overabundance of amateur data analysis seeking to answer fraught global topics is dangerous and that such tools need to be augmented to prevent faux-empiricist manipulation; on the other hand, it develops a uniquely accessible tool that encourages experimentation with data science techniques from a purely personal perspective, prompting users to recognize the false objectivity that belies data visualization and instead use data visualization as a tool for personal reflection.</p>
<p>I chose to engage with network analysis tools because they are among some of the most vague and inscrutable data visualizations, often difficult to program and used for hyper-specific datasets. However, they are increasing in popularity, particularly with analyses of social media, so they are not entirely unfamiliar to a general audience. In the sections that follow, I will first describe the project’s digital technology, laying out what this tool is. Then, I will approach the tool from a reflexive critical design perspective, thinking through network theories, design principles, and design purposes to exhume the logic of this tool. Finally, I will engage with the concept of experimental critical design and demonstrate how this digital tool could be used to facilitate experimentation in a mode that is both sociologically-informed and germane to the digital humanities.</p>

“Loss” is a data visualization website<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> that encourages users to think through the question, “What do you need to remove in order to erase [thing] from [your life or society]?” The website allows users to develop their own network visualization through a hierarchical visualization of HTML elements. By naming, arranging, and addingnodesin the HTML document, users are able to seamlessly generate a visualization using the JavaScript library D3 (Data Driven Documents)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bostock2019"> [bostock2019] </a>. The website subverts the typical employment of D3 as primarily a way of visualizing extant data by inviting users to create their own networks, a task which, while increasingly accessible, is still mostly limited to those who have some knowledge of computer programming and who have access to datasets. By allowing users to create their own visualization — and their own datasets — “Loss” encourages users of the website not to just think with data or to think about data, but to think <em>through</em> data, using data visualization strategies not just as a way of representing the world but of actively engaging with it. The fact that network visualization is being used, with its veneer of empiricism, also necessarily interrogates the idea that datasets are always perfect reflections of reality. Moreover, it points to the larger question of what a network visualization even represents, interrogating the taken-for-granted visuals we are increasingly exposed to.</p>

<p>From a user experience standpoint, the design interface is rather simplistic. At this point, it may be helpful to navigate to the<a href="https://loss.peterforberg.com/">website</a>and access the page labelledtutorial,as I’ll be walking through the site’s functionality. The tutorial begins with an interactive statement seen in Figure 1: “Today, I want to remove a thing from society.” In the tool, the termsthingandsocietyare actually dropdown menus which allow the user to produce different statements, such as “Today I want to remove a person from my life” or “a concept from history.” Based on the user’s selections, the program asks follow-up questions which lay the foundation for their network. Thus, someone who decides to remove another person from their life will be asked about what the two people share together, which will later be turned into a node. Once the questions have been answered, the user is presented with the full tool and a preliminary version of their network of loss. An example of what this looks like is seen in Figure 2: On the left-hand side, there is a hierarchical interface akin to an ontology or file management system where users can add nodes to the network and give them names, sizes, and colors. This hierarchical structure can be manipulated, with nodes rearranged or deleted. On the right-hand side, we see the results of this hierarchy: when the “generate” button is pressed, the network is constructed and visualized for the user as a series of connected nodes which can then be dragged around. If the user wanted to save their network to be used in a different visualization software, that option is made available to them with theexportbutton.</p>

        <p>Example Network Built Using the Tool
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The example shown in the Figure 2 is taken from prototyping the tool with colleagues and friends who eat meat. They were prompted with the statement, “Today, I want to remove meat from my life.” The networks developed by users in response included everything from restaurants to holiday traditions. This use case resonated differently for different people: for some the tool provided a visualization of just how much they would lose by going vegetarian, while for others it enabled the construction of a thorough and strategic plan for going meatless. In testing, people were asked to design networks that touched upon deeply personal systems — such as removing a loved one from one’s life — or systems that, while personally resonant, aren’t always easy to fully imagine — such as removing the institution of policing from society. Even in these use cases, the tool doesn’t make any assertion about whether loss is a good thing or a bad thing, nor does it set parameters for what should or should not be included in the network. It simply allows for these networks to be built and visualized. This is a decision that I made as the administrator of these use cases: it would be entirely possible for the tool to be used to ask the same questions, with different framing, in order to produce networks that were critical of meat consumption or policing and posed questions to guide network construction and interrogate people’s relationships to these systems. Such uses are discussed more in the later section “Critical Design as Experiment.”</p>
<p>While “Loss” doesn’t take a stand on whether any given loss is good or bad, it is still explicit about its pedagogical design and how the project is intended to be used. The landing page text reads, “…there is no amount of ‘big data’ that can be visualized to explain the very personal, individual experiences we have with systems and ideas. So instead of using data visualizations for rigorous science, we’ll leverage these tools to think through how we are implicated in systems.” The aforementioned guided tutorial facilitates thethinking throughthat the landing page requests. The tutorial is not an explanation of the tool itself but a line of questioning that is supposed to be evocative of different forms of thinking. These questions ask users to think more deeply about their engagement with systems and contingencies, and in this way, the website continues to make clear the designer’s motivations for its creation and the worldview it seeks to present. Should users skip the tutorial, the main tool still contains a rotating series of prompts that reiterate systems-level thinking, with pointed questions that provide pathways for expanding the network they’re creating to include things like historical structures or emotions. There is also a brief explanation of the tool’s features, but once again, users aren’t instructed to visualize certain topics or assume certain political positions. All of this is done to intentionally be content-neutral: the tool prepares them for <em>how</em> to think about any topic of their choosing, not what to think about it.</p>
<p>On the technical side, the program’s functionality is fairly straightforward: users are essentially adding, deleting, and rearranging HTML elements using the hierarchy. These div — or content division — elements are comprised of two main components: their location and their customization. Each div — which we can understand as a node in the network — is placed within an HTML hierarchy, wrapped within other divs. A child div is located inside of a parent div. The child div knows the name of its parent based on its location, and this HTML information is converted into network data — the links between nodes — using JavaScript. The parent div knows how many children it has, which is only used to make sure users do not accidentally delete the entire graph. Each div also has customizable features — name, size, and color — that make it unique. These features are also translated into network data using JavaScript and used to style the nodes in the graph. It might be helpful to imagine the computational logic as akin to a giant matryoshka doll: each interior doll knows which doll it is inside, and each doll has unique features. Each div knows which div it is inside, and each div has unique features. Because the network is generated on the basis of unique names for divs, users can enter the same name multiple times to give a div multiple connections. D3, a data analysis library for JavaScript that can turn JavaScript data into charts and graphs, is used to convert the network data produced by the collaborating HTML and JavaScript in order to visualize the nodes.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Before moving to the theoretical reasons for the project’s design, I want to explain why the tool’s UI and code are the way they are. First, the user interface was designed to be simplistic and approachable, with only a few variables (size, color, name, and position) that allowed for maximum creativity. In the design phase, there were other ideas for how the UI could look: for example, it was considered that the tool could begin with a monochrome screen, and as objects were removed (by being added to the network), the color, too, would be removed. This prototype would have more closely mirrored the actual process of loss, of things being taken away, but it wouldn’t have produced network visualizations that are familiar and easily introduced into other contexts. The design process included toying with other interfaces and features through an iterative engagement (initial designs were shared with colleagues and friends for feedback), but it ultimately settled on the one here for its ease of use, resemblance to other network visualization software, and technical simplicity — some features, like adding nodes via interaction with the generated network, were technically resource consumptive or difficult to use.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the code itself is not well-optimized, nor does it leverage advanced JavaScript libraries (aside from D3) to perform computations. There are a number of reasons for this: First, the goal was to program something with few dependences so that people with only an intermediate knowledge of the main web languages would be able to read its code. Second, as a fairly lightweight application, there was no need to optimize performance as ultimately, the code works. Finally, aspects of the code that are repetitive or mathematically simple better articulate the theory behind the code. For example, there are plenty of other ways to create a web app in which the hierarchy which generates the network leverages math to build out the network, but in this version, what happens computationally is what is envisioned theoretically: a parent node is known to be a parent because it quite literally contains its child node. They have a direct, computational relationship such that the computer “thinks” about the relationship the way we think about the relationship. Moreover, the computer “thinks” about the relationship the way network data represents those relationships, which is why the user can export the graph to a network data format. There’s a one-to-one relationship between computational representation, network theoretical representation, and the actual network relationships being represented. Thus, this software privileges simple, theoretically-driven computation to assist users in thinking through data, so the theory driving its design is what I’ll discuss next.</p>
<h2 id="critical-design-as-theory">Critical Design as Theory</h2>
<p>The data visualizations that led to the creation of this project are largely rooted in the theories of network analysis. Network analysis has enjoyed widespread adoption in the social sciences as a way of structurally examining the relationships between different entities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wasserman1994"> [wasserman1994] </a>. In contemporary uses of network analysis, it can be employed to better understand patterns of viral spread, social networks of support, or online networks of political actors<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> . Beyond statistical and theoretical implementations, network analysis has been translated into a robust form of data visualization that — for all of its popular uses — remains less employed if only because the data for network visualization is not always easy to attain and is rarely bundled together with other data. Due to the diversity of network visualization’s applications, it is at times difficult to know what precisely is being represented with a given network. Thenodesof the network are often straightforward — representing human agents, organizations, or creatures — but the links between each of these nodes can represent a variety of relationships. Some links are clearly defined: they might show the transmission of diseases or check to see if two nodes arefriendson a social media platform. Other network visualizations strategies actively delineate the changing definitions of links and nodes in the visualization, such as in the project “Anatomy of an AI System” which sketches out the various international relationships required for the production of an Amazon Echo<a class="footnote-ref" href="#crawford2018"> [crawford2018] </a>. This non-computational network visualization ambivalently defines the relationships between a variety of types of nodes which range from actors such ascompaniesto concepts such asgeological processes.These two drastically different approaches to network visualization — one with very clearly defined sets of nodes and links, computationally generated, and one with ambiguous categories of nodes and links, qualitatively designed — demonstrate the potential for network visualizations to be used for projects that go beyond limited datasets and ask us more broadly to interpret the relationships presented in visualizations. Indeed, many visualizations fall somewhere in the middle, simply showingrelationshipsbetween nodes, a term which can take on a multiplicity of meanings.</p>
<p>While network theory and network analysis remain useful backdrops to network visualization, they are intimately focused on <em>structure</em> and regularity, embracing an empiricism that might distinguish itself from the Amazon Echo approach, which engages with networks in all of their shifting complexity. “Loss” embraces this ambiguity of links, nodes, and networks to take a figurational sociology approach to network visualization which recognizes that attempts at structured analysis might fall short of capturing the complexities of networks by focusing on a more limited notion of what belongs in the network. Figurational sociology, developed by Norbert Elias, recognizes the risks of empiricism in representing complex human behaviors: In response, the figurational approach criticizes the move towards social scientific essentialism that “…blurs the procedural character of social phenomena by presupposing the existence of permanent structures subjacent to change” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#quintaneiro2006"> [quintaneiro2006] </a>. Adopting a perspective that recognizes historical contexts, power, and the need for multi-level analysis, figurational sociology benefits from its focus, “…on the understanding of the structures that mutually dependent human beings establish, and the transformations they suffer, both individually and in groups, due to the increase or reduction of their interdependencies and gradients of power” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#quintaneiro2006"> [quintaneiro2006] </a>. Elias’s framework was mostly concerned with how to negotiate the chasm between analysis of individuals as people subordinate to a large social system and as the very agents who worked to construct those social systems, superordinate to their forces. While it too has a penchant for structuralism, in modern applications, figurational sociology wraps in a constellatory logic that attempts to capture a more robust picture of systems by drawing out the idiosyncrasies of social dynamics that pure structuralism would flaunt. This negotiation between structure and adaptation, between individual experiences and social systems, between history and anachronism, makes figurational sociology a more appealing approach. At its core, it is about the configuration of individuals and structures as they collectively produce the social world in dialogue rather than as one determines the other.</p>
<p>The language of figurational sociology is suited for network visualizations — often referring towebs,linkages,dependencies,andnetworks— and a revival of figurational sociology has come about in conversation with network analysis, which means that there are visualizations that describe the relationships between actors in social configurations<a class="footnote-ref" href="#baur2011"> [baur2011] </a>. Adding to figurational sociology’s lexicon, it is important to imagine both individual and social experiences and structures as beingencounters,assemblages,andprecarious<a class="footnote-ref" href="#tsing2015"> [tsing2015] </a>. Anthropologist Anna Tsing’s wide-ranging work on the global networks of the <em>matsutake</em> mushroom trade develops in language what this project would aim to develop in network visualizations, as she discussesencounters— sometimes fleeting but still important — between unexpected actors,assemblagesof perhaps apparently unrelated systems and events, and the general precarity of the social world in a changing economy and ecology. She, too, employs a constellatory logic that lets disparate subjects converge to create something in their relationships to one another — in their configurations.</p>
<p>The figurational approach, especially as it recognizes the strength of phenomenology, tries to unpack these assemblages, encounters, and systems for what they are, revealing their role in our daily lives and applying structure and systematic analysis where there once was story, but Tsing’s work is evidence for how we tend to mask these analyses with a deeply individual narrativization of complex systems. Reflexive critical design, especially for a DHthat matters,tasks designers with self-reflection not just because reflexivity helps explain the analytical framing of their work, but also because it elucidates the political procedures of their work — as evidenced by the ways that authors have demonstrated their desire to alter social behavior or critique racist technology. Certainly, this project’s procedures are grounded in assisting users to unpack their tendency towards individual narratives and think in terms of configurations and systems, networks of related and contingent subjects who might sometimes be invisible to individuals. The theoretical framing of figurational sociology is employed procedurally, in the design of the website, to accomplish a goal that has political implications. Imagine that this tool was employed not in its currently content-neutral format but instead in a format that asked users to imagine a world without policing, Amazon, or sexism: what would we need to remove to take down these institutions, corporations, and prejudices? A simple alteration of the website’s language, with a little more background provided on each subject, can quickly turn “Loss” into an explicitly political project. Indeed, the project was designed to be employed in such a way, so this is no stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>The procedures of a digital tool, especially when used to educate and allow users to produce more content, thus become an ethical and pedagogical practice. Historian Joan Wallach Scott characterizes ethical practices as those in which people strive to reduce the gap between reality as it is and reality as it ought to be<a class="footnote-ref" href="#scott2019"> [scott2019] </a>. “Loss” asks people to imagine a world of social consequences and contingencies, thinking through the responsibilities of an interconnected world in which the loss of something — such as a person, institution, or idea — has effects that ripple out. In other words, it aims to instill an ethical practice, asking users to think about the world <em>as it is</em> and then how it <em>might or ought to be</em> following a change in its configuration. This is inherently pedagogical, especially considering the way that the tutorial and guiding questions are framed. Not all digital tools take a pedagogical or ethical approach: they present the world as it is, or they experiment on people without revealing the purpose for the experimentation, but in order to establish a DH that matters, we need to recognize that procedures, in representing a worldview, can also represent an imaginary that is to be resolved with a new way of thinking — one that the tools can hope to instill. If John Culkin’s summation of Marshall McLuhan’s work is correct — “We shape our tools and thereafter they shape us” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#culkin1967"> [culkin1967] </a>— then we need to recognize how these tools can be used to educate for social change.</p>
<h2 id="critical-design-as-experiment">Critical Design as Experiment</h2>
<p>In the current design of the website, a smallAboutpage invites users who have made a network that they enjoy to submit it. One can imagine how a tool like this can be used to produce data that can be recirculated and analyzed, recognizing the data for how it was produced. If the tool was to be introduced in a classroom environment with a specific prompt, such as “What does it take to remove policing from society?” , then students could think through the various ways that policing is implicated in their lives, and each student’s developed network would represent a valuable data point in a larger narrative about policing. Computationally, the tool is simple enough to edit that one could port it to their own website and alter the tutorial such that the tutorial prompts become a research question: one could code the prompt to state “Today, I want to remove social media from my life,” edit the follow-up questions, and distribute the website to people as part of a research study on social media use. As experiment — and perhaps as experimental pedagogy — “Loss” allows for the production of more data that can be used to interrogate such questions across different topics. This speaks directly to the fact that network data is often difficult to come by — but that is a fundamentally different type of network data. The data used in large scale analysis seeks statistical rigor through uniform structure. This data would reflect very different types of networks that can be leveraged in different ways, analyzed qualitatively in addition to quantitatively: why did people choose to include certain items in their network, why were certain items connected, what do these connections represent, has the use of this tool changed the way that they were thinking about a given issue? Each of these questions becomes another entry point for data analysis when examined through this lens.</p>
<p>This pathway might seem circuitous — arriving at qualitative data analysis through the techniques of quantitative,big dataapproaches — and that’s because it is. Approaches designed for large scale analysis can be applied to other settings, and the development of these quantitative techniques can make qualitative analysis more robust. If a large enough group of people use this tool to respond to the same prompt, then it is entirely possible that that data could be collected and analyzed. Through data cleaning and natural language processing techniques, the various individual networks could be concatenated to make one larger network, and it would be possible to ask new questions: what nodes appear across participants, what nodes receive the largest size, are nodes consistently connected to the same central node across participants, and were most participants thinking more about their own lives or about wider society? Of course, such analysis needs perpetually to return to the data’s source and thus the theoretical framework of the tool: it was a tool designed to produce data under a specific framing, and so all data should be treated in relation to that framing. Here, a convergence of research techniques seeks to break interdisciplinary boundaries: with qualitatively generated data designed in such a way as to be able to be analyzed quantitatively, we can further dismantle the distinction between these techniques and see the possibilities for arguments that leverage multiple forms of analysis to demonstrate their claims. Further, by anticipatingbig datathrough a qualitative design, this skirts the ethical dilemmas that accompanydata-mining.If data is to become more restricted to protect privacy, then now is the time to start imagining alternative — perhaps more traditionally experimental — ways to ethically source data. As an experiment, “Loss” allows for the customizable generation of network data that can be employed in research settings to produce quantitative and qualitative analyses that speak to one another.</p>
<h2 id="critical-design-as-data">Critical Design as Data</h2>
<p>Finally, the reflexive, critical interrogation of the design of “Loss” allows for three different types of data. First, “Loss” itself is data. As a freely available, publicly hosted platform accessible on GitHub and with annotated code, researchers who are reviewing network visualization strategies can do critical readings of the code that comprises “Loss.” In the same way that mathematicians have scrutinized digital tools to see how they run statistical analyses or computer scientists have critiqued different programs to see which ones most effectively complete a given task, DH researchers can critically compare the code of a program like “Loss” to see how it posits and procedurally argues for a social theory<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2012"> [burdick2012] </a>. Comparative critical coding is not only valuable to researchers seeking to understand the social ramifications of code, but it can assist designers in producing better coded tools. And analysis of “Loss” as a digital tool doesn’t have to be confined to its code: a vital component of software is its other aesthetics, such as data visualization’s visual repertoires, which work in tandem with procedural arguments to facilitate argumentation through multiple rhetorical vectors<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burdick2012"> [burdick2012] </a>.</p>
<p>Second, this paper is in itself a datapoint in a larger conversation about network analysis and another conversation about the use of digital tools for ethical and pedagogical practices. Most network analysis tools are developed from purely mathematical perspectives, and theory is then applied to the results of that math by outside researchers who had no hand in shaping how the tool functions. This paper is different in that the data — “Loss” itself — comes from a theoretical interpretation of what networks mean. As a case study in the design of digital tools, this is something of an auto-ethnographic understanding of how it is that I, as a designer of network software, translated my social theories into a tool designed for network analysis. This is different from saying that this is a theory paper: this is a design paper, a design document the likes of which are rarely circulated because most digital tools are not developed under specific, self-critical theoretical frameworks. Perhaps it is reductive to call thisdata,but in the under-utilized world of critical design, researchers are often looking for interlocutors whose work they can examine for its handling of biases and latent assumptions<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bardzell2013"> [bardzell2013] </a>. Quite literally, the process of design becomes data for investigation.</p>
<p>Finally, “Loss” offers one way of employing data visualization techniques to grapple with the questions of loss, removal, and figurational thinking. It is a specific strategy for both analyzing and communicating people’s experiences of loss and removal, but it is certainly one of many ways to procedurally address systems. The website recognizes this, writing, “We are increasingly able to recognize systems for what they are, but they remain difficult to capture in their entirety. Moreover, each person experiences these systems differently. This is an open question: how would you think through loss and removal? How would you visualize it, communicate it to others?” It then gives users the space to express their strategies for visualizing loss, though this information is not collected, merely used as a primer for the tool to come. Under the framework of experimental critical design, one could imagine asking participants to design an online tool that imagines loss — while I was building this tool, people who I shared my prototypes with had their own ideas for how one could go about visualizing and playing with the concept of removal. The divergent perspectives on how to procedurally represent loss are a final way in which critical design can constitute data; the process of design, opened up to many interlocutors, becomes a way of getting at people’s social theories of the world.</p>
<p>It’s important to reiterate that under thecritical design as dataperspective, it is the design itself that is data: the design of “Loss,” the design-document and theory behind “Loss,” and the ways that “Loss” could be leveraged to access other people’s design ideas, which then become data. In recognizing that designs are social theories, we can usedesignsto access theoretical dialogues — among designers or any group of people. This is inherently sociological: by using the design frameworks offered by digital humanities, researchers can obtain data about people’s understanding of the social world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper has precariously moved across an assortment of disciplines, leveraging theory, methods, and designs from anthropology, sociology, digital humanities, science and technology studies, history, and data science to evaluate a tool designed with no definitive disciplinary home. One could imagine going to the website and posing the question, “What would it take to remove critical design from academia?” The resulting network would likely reveal the disciplinary anxieties that the turn to the digital has allowed to foment. As digital tools become ubiquitous across fields of study, it is not the job of the DH researcher or the sociologist or the computer scientist alone to critically examine the tools that they use and produce (though they should), but it is the job of the entire academic community to have a critical eye for the social ramifications of technology that is found in classrooms, corporations, and people’s personal devices.</p>
<p>“Loss” is an articulation of how a sociological theory can be implemented in a digital tool. The joint resources of digital humanities’ emphasis on design and the social science’s emphasis on theoretical frameworks allowed for a self-critical examination of how “Loss” attempts to implement its social theory through procedural argumentation. And as a tool for experimentation, “Loss” could be leveraged to produce new data that would challenge the theory presented in its original design. Critical design allows for a deeper interrogation of the theories that structure our digital designs, the data they produce, and how both the designs and their theories become data for investigation as we strive to develop better tools — in viewing “Loss” through this lens, its design must become defensible so as to justify the arguments it procedurally makes and the data it procedurally produces. Where this paper diverges from other perspectives is in its leveraging of digital humanities design ideas — like procedural rhetoric — to approach sociological questions. As a sociologist, I’ve often compared the work of interviewing and content analysis to the work of a critical close-reader — in each case, the sociologist extracts social meaning by examining the rhetorical strategies of language or visualization found in interview transcripts or online posts. Now, it is the same — social meaning is extracted from a close-reading of procedure and procedural rhetoric to understand how social understandings are systematized.</p>
<p>While there are prominent examples of digital tools that are designed with a critical reflexivity, standard practice in the digital humanities, as well as data science and the social sciences, is to employ tools that go uninterrogated. Further, DH has stayed closer tocritiquethan to design, typically employing tools designed for other fields or general use. This has limited how DH is able to be productive: both how it is able to produce theoretically-rigorous, content-specific tools and how it is able to produce its own data for investigation. “Loss” is certainly not pathbreaking in its design nor its theory, but it is a proposition for both DH and sociology, a proposition for productively designing tools that are made to generate data not available elsewhere, data that springs from a robust design intentions.</p>
<p>Corporate tools face the scrutiny of the market to establish themselves, but academia is not gifted with a talent for creating viral, widely-used digital platforms. Tools are used for hyper-specific purposes, they become obsolete or unsupported, or they’re designed without a strong enough team from different fields. For a DH that matters, academia must recognize the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration as opposed to market competition, the collective power of designing socially-empowering and productive digital tools. And academia shouldn’t forget its place in education: As the digital divide in businesses and schools grow, DH can more concretely position itself as public discipline engaged in digital pedagogy and committed to digital literacy that can overcome the tendency of technology to further segregate people based on class, race, and education<a class="footnote-ref" href="#henderson2011"> [henderson2011] </a>. DH can seek a mutually-beneficial relationship with the public: designing tools for public use that can be leveraged by researchers to collect ethical and unique data while also remaining engaging and educative, tools that people would enjoy using and might even find useful and instructive.</p>
<p>Design as a whole needs to rethink its approaches to data, ethics, and education. If digital tools are reshaping society, we need to be critical in our design of tools. If data is the new oil, then we shouldn’t become the new oil barons, chasing data at any cost. This is not to limit the work of researchers but to suggest that there are productive affordances of digital design that can open up new methods and strategies for analyzing and producing data while effecting social change.</p>

<p>Scholars have long been captivated by the idea that knowledge generation is outpacing their ability to keep up, necessitating creative techniques and solutions to organize, manage, and access information. From scientist Vannevar Bush’s memex<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to futurist Richard Buckminster Fuller’s Geoscope,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> researchers have envisioned high-tech tools for information management and knowledge creation since before the advent of big data. Today, well into the era of hyperlinked text and geographic information systems not unlike the miracle tools envisioned by 20th century inventors, making knowledge on even very specific areas of scholarship tractable remains a complicated challenge. As scholarly knowledge continues to grow, so does interest in quantitative techniques for summary, survey, and synthesis of knowledge domains.</p>
<p>Knowledge mapping is one such survey and synthesis technique. It combines data visualization and network analysis to depict large collections of information spatially, as if they were a landscape viewed from above. Knowledge mapping is a general term for an analysis informed by and applied in multiple areas of scholarship, including information science<a class="footnote-ref" href="#borner2010"> [borner2010] </a>, literature<a class="footnote-ref" href="#moretti2007"> [moretti2007] </a>, history<a class="footnote-ref" href="#graham_etal2015"> [graham_etal2015] </a>, and bibliometrics<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chen2016"> [chen2016] </a>. These maps are at once analytical, managerial, and communicative: analytical because they provide tests of network theories and because bibliometric data was one of the earliest sources of big data for such analyses; managerial because they guide decision-making, funding allocation, and evaluation; and communicative because they aim to support discovery and guide hypothesis formation by depicting knowledge as a collaborative, interlinked whole. Knowledge maps are simultaneously rhetorically powerful (because they make visual arguments) and ethically fraught (because visual arguments presented in such charts are often accepted as objective fact), but knowledge mapping techniques have not yet been brought into conversation with recent work in digital humanities surrounding ethical visualization and data feminism<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio2019"> [dignazio2019] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio_etal2020"> [dignazio_etal2020] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hepworth2017"> [hepworth2017] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hepworth2020"> [hepworth2020] </a>.</p>
<p>Ethical visualization is the practice of acknowledging and mitigating the potential for harm that is inherent to particular visualizations<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hepworth_etal2018"> [hepworth_etal2018] </a>. Ethical visualization and data feminism require consideration of the whole data pipeline, from acquisition to analysis to visualization, and attention to the ways in which some perspectives are marginalized, omitted, or elided<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio_etal2016"> [dignazio_etal2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio_etal2020"> [dignazio_etal2020] </a>. Both traditions require not only acknowledging the potential negative effects of a visualization or drawbacks of a particular dataset, but actively working to mitigate them in a way that increases understanding while minimizing harm<a class="footnote-ref" href="#cairo2014"> [cairo2014] </a>. Given nascent discussions in bibliometrics about the potential harm perpetuated by uncritical application of bibliometric techniques for evaluation, it is an important time to bring critical practices into conversations about knowledge mapping<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bornmann2017"> [bornmann2017] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conway2014"> [conway2014] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#donovan2019"> [donovan2019] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#furner2014"> [furner2014] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#rolf2021"> [rolf2021] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#zuccala2016"> [zuccala2016] </a>.</p>
<p>In this paper, we demonstrate how principles of ethical visualization and data feminism can be applied in the development of a knowledge map to produce a more trustworthy and more useful product. We do this by providing a detailed account of the path we followed to build a knowledge map of climate communication research, highlighting practical challenges encountered in creating such a visualization and how ideas from ethical visualization literature helped navigate them. Specifically, we: (1) demonstrate the importance of critical practices in the development of a complex type of chart, (2) illustrate the intertwined nature of analysis and results in big data projects, and (3) take a first step toward a feminist bibliometrics informed by critical work in digital humanities. This addresses a previously identified need for clear guidance on the visual communication of knowledge networks<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conway2014"> [conway2014] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#garilova_etal2019"> [garilova_etal2019] </a>. It has relevance for digital humanists working with knowledge networks and bibliometricians seeking practical strategies for mitigating harmful externalities of evaluative bibliometrics. It also enriches ongoing conversations in the digital humanities about ethical visualization and data feminism with examples of how frequently ethical choices arise in a data visualization project.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we emphasize the constructedness of these types of visualizations, showing why a purely quantitative, purely objective depiction of a knowledge network is neither possible nor particularly useful. We argue that the best way to produce an effective knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires attention to the ways trust and accountability can be produced at every step of analysis and production.</p>
<h2 id="2-knowledge-mapping">2. Knowledge mapping</h2>
<p>Knowledge maps are powerful tools for planning, collaborating, teaching, and communicating, because they depict metaknowledge about how topics and problems are structured<a class="footnote-ref" href="#borner2010"> [borner2010] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#evans_etal2011"> [evans_etal2011] </a>.Metaknowledge– literally, knowledge about knowledge – may sound like a dangerously totalizinggod trick,but it can in fact be understood as a concept gesturing at the positionality and situatedness of all knowledge, and the necessity of combining multiple partial perspectives to understand a system<a class="footnote-ref" href="#haraway1988"> [haraway1988] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio2019"> [dignazio2019] </a>. Sociologists James A. Evans and Jacob G. Foster define metaknowledge as the result of “critical scrutiny of what is known, how, and by whom” and suggest that we might best understand what metaknowledge is by thinking about what we, as individual scholars with particular trainings, career paths, and expertise, think about as we read a journal article in order to “index a broader context of ideas, [scholars], and disciplines” – the kind of knowledge gained from being a participant in a system through time<a class="footnote-ref" href="#evans_etal2011"> [evans_etal2011] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kwan2002"> [kwan2002] </a>. Knowledge maps offer an alternative way to gain a similar kind of qualitative understanding via quantitative techniques, affording viewers an intuitive summary of a large collection of information<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lima2011"> [lima2011] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#moretti2007"> [moretti2007] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#vangeenen_etal2020"> [vangeenen_etal2020] </a>. Metaknowledge is important because it sparks abduction, or diagnostic-style logic, where experts may arrive intuitively at a conclusion based on partial information combined with their existing understanding of the system and situation at hand, and where knowledge may be generated instead of simply synthesized<a class="footnote-ref" href="#brooke2017"> [brooke2017] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#douven2017"> [douven2017] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#graham_etal2015"> [graham_etal2015] </a>.</p>
<p>While it may be preferable to gain metaknowledge the traditional way, by participating in a knowledge system over a lifetime, this is not always practical or possible. Knowledge maps act as a tool which – just like regular maps of landscapes – are useful for sharing information, for planning where to go and how to get there, for noticing patterns or pathways that might not have been apparent to boots on the ground, and for coordinating collective effort in the face of complexity. They support switching between general knowledge and specific pieces of information and evidence, an ability which has been identified as a fundamental practice of critical scholarship<a class="footnote-ref" href="#edmond2018"> [edmond2018] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#moretti2007"> [moretti2007] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kwan2002"> [kwan2002] </a>. Their utility comes even though knowledge offered by such a bird’s eye view is clearly different from the kind gained through personal experience, immersion, and reflection<a class="footnote-ref" href="#evans_etal2011"> [evans_etal2011] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#moretti2007"> [moretti2007] </a>. Essentially, it is worth simultaneously being cautious about the algorithmic ways in which knowledge maps synthesize big citation data and present it as knowledge, while also emphasizing the incredible utility of this form for producing, transmitting, and constructing collective knowledge<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio_etal2016"> [dignazio_etal2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio2019"> [dignazio2019] </a>. Bibliometrician David A. Pendlebury summed this up effectively when he observed a need for “charting a path between the simple and false and the complex and unusable” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#pendlebury2019"> [pendlebury2019] </a>.</p>
<p>When constructed in partnership with residents from the mapped research domain, knowledge maps can prompt identification and reassessment of taken-for granted assumptions and highlight forces shaping problem definition in a field. In fact, examples of this work in climate domains are what initially inspired our attempt to map the climate communication research landscape<a class="footnote-ref" href="#canon_etal2022"> [canon_etal2022] </a>. For example, informationist Christopher Belter and climate scientist Dian Seidel<a class="footnote-ref" href="#belter_etal2013"> [belter_etal2013] </a>created network visualizations to reveal (dis)connections in geoengineering knowledge, using sparse network charts to show how some planetary systems receive more focus than others, and that lack of information exchange between areas of study means there may be inadequate consideration of potential interactions between different geoengineering strategies. Another example is the work of psychologist Laura Kati Corlew and her team<a class="footnote-ref" href="#corlew_etal2015"> [corlew_etal2015] </a>, who successfully used social network analysis to build a knowledge sharing and resource discovery tool for climate professionals in the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>These projects are notable because they leverage knowledge maps as communication and collaboration tools while being sensitive to audience needs and effects on those depicted in the visually powerful network charts. Rather than viewing analysis as an endpoint, these studies distill the information spaces into clear visualizations for interested audiences. Knowledge maps should be built from this perspective, to be both useful and usable and to assist viewers in extracting meaning from information spaces and analyses that may otherwise be esoterically complex.</p>
<h2 id="3-designing-the-climate-communication-knowledge-map">3. Designing the climate communication knowledge map</h2>
<p>The climate communication knowledge mapping project was initially situated in the tradition of science mapping, a kind of knowledge mapping undertaken by computer scientists and network analysts. Science mapping uses bibliometric data to reveal the structure of a knowledge domain by creating networks of papers or authors linked by citations or collaborations. However, despite having domain expertise in climate communication and fluency in network analysis techniques (often considered the ideal for this type of project), we immediately ran into ethical and practical challenges that were not well addressed in the science mapping literature, perhaps because too much emphasis is placed on the objectivity of network maps, the assumed impartiality of algorithmic curation, and the potential of data speaking for itself<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conway2014"> [conway2014] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio2019"> [dignazio2019] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio_etal2020"> [dignazio_etal2020] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hepworth2020"> [hepworth2020] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#white_etal1998"> [white_etal1998] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#yang_etal2016"> [yang_etal2016] </a>. In our project, limited technological resources necessitated static depictions of the knowledge network, data quality precluded purely algorithmic curation, and it was frequently unclear how fundamental tasks like disambiguation and layout should be approached when the goal was to create a useful knowledge map (instead of just to arrive at an analytical result). In this section, we describe in detail the challenges encountered in building the climate communication knowledge map and point out how attention to conversations in ethical visualization and data feminism provided needed guidance on navigating them.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the impact of scientific approaches to visualization on knowledge mapping, a significant amount of data in knowledge mapping projects is not pre-processed before it is visualized. It is thought that network analysis itself controls for any errors or ambiguities in the underlying data<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chen2016"> [chen2016] </a>. If ambiguities do exist in the network map, conventional wisdom holds that resulting irregularities cancel each other out, and overall conclusions are not affected<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fegley_etal2013"> [fegley_etal2013] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#white_etal1998"> [white_etal1998] </a>. We did not find this to be the case in our knowledge map, especially when imagining how it might be useful and trustworthy for climate communicators. If the first thing a user notices when looking at a knowledge map is a data error (such as a single leading scholar being split into multiple author nodes), it cannot be expected that the user will trust other elements of the knowledge map. Given that the point of a knowledge map is to support reasonable inferences about the structure and function of the research domain, it is a serious problem if data issues affect interpretation. Engineer Jinseok Kim’s research reveals the nature and extent of factors that distort knowledge maps<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2014a"> [kim_etal2014a] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2014b"> [kim_etal2014b] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2016"> [kim_etal2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim2019"> [kim2019] </a>. For example, datasets rife with author name ambiguities appearscale-free,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> a feature long thought to characterize citation networks<a class="footnote-ref" href="#desolla1965"> [desolla1965] </a>, when in fact they aren’t. Consequences to both the mapped research community and to theorists studying network processes can be profound when data visualizations uncritically display conclusions that may be based on irregularities in the data, and when funding decisions are made based on this data. As a result, the bulk of our paper focuses on data processing, and the ethical considerations that may be glossed over when the network analysis itself is the jumping off point for a knowledge mapping study.</p>
<p>In this section, we undertake the important data feminist approach of showing our work<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio_etal2020"> [dignazio_etal2020] </a>. We provide a complete description of how we produced the climate communication knowledge map, attempting to be transparent about elements of data preparation and visualization design that are not generally discussed in published literature, but which are of vital importance in following an ethical and accountable process of visualization design<a class="footnote-ref" href="#callaway_etal2020"> [callaway_etal2020] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio_etal2020"> [dignazio_etal2020] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hepworth_etal2018"> [hepworth_etal2018] </a>.

<h2 id="31-data-search-and-selection">3.1 Data search and selection</h2>
<p>Data for the knowledge map came from Clarivate’s Web of Science database, selected for its accessibility despite known gaps in its coverage and because previous work suggests that it entails about 50% as much cleaning and curation time as Scopus and about 5% as much as Google Scholar<a class="footnote-ref" href="#andres2009"> [andres2009] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#harzing2015"> [harzing2015] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#meho_etal2007"> [meho_etal2007] </a>. Though it would have been preferable to combine multiple datasets to get the broadest possible bibliometric survey of climate communication literature, there are significant practical challenges to combining relational citation data from different databases. We used a search query <code>(TS = (climat* NEAR chang* AND communicat*))</code> from a previous systematic review of climate communication, conducted by an expert in the field<a class="footnote-ref" href="#moser2016"> [moser2016] </a>. This was intended to ensure that this knowledge map complemented previously accepted delineations of the climate communication field and would therefore hopefully be more trustworthy to members of the mapped research domain. Query-based data selection for any knowledge mapping study faces a trade-off betweenrecall(getting every single relevant item) andrelevance(making sure no single irrelevant item is included), and it is always a concern that excluded materials are not evenly distributed across the field in question. The Web of Science search yielded 5,934 results on July 31, 2020.</p>
<p>One of the reasons data is not generally cleaned before analysis is the expectation that selecting and extracting thegiant component(the largest set of connected nodes in a network) will filter papers that don’t belong (because they’ll be in disconnected communities). In the climate communication knowledge network, some combination of one-time participation by many researchers, the nebulous border between climate science, environmental science, and climate communication, and the broad application of some permutation of the termsclimate,communication,andchangein nearly every academic discipline meant that the giant component included many irrelevant items when constructed with the complete Web of Science data pull (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>We explored programmatic filtering strategies to prune the irrelevant data, but these all failed, to the point that it seemed much more time would be spent fine-tuning an algorithm specifically suited to disambiguating this one dataset than it would take to disambiguate it manually. Manual (human) review resulted in the removal of ~50% of the returned records (2,997 retained; 2,937 removed). Though in some ways it seemed alarming to remove half of the returned data, it also seemed misleading not to do so, because clearly irrelevant items (for example, papers about inter-model communication of climate signals, effects of climate change on insect pheromonal communication, and changes in workplace communication climates) distorted the visualized network (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). This highlights the impossibility of achieving an objective delineation of a particular research area from an unprocessed dataset and the need to rely on human judgment in data visualizations even at these early stages. This process of data preparation opens a knowledge mapping analysis up to perpetuating harm in two ways: first, that whether an algorithm or a human applies inclusion/exclusion criteria, some error is likely to occur, and second, that the underlying data does not adequately or equally represent the breadth of scholarship in a particular knowledge domain. To mitigate this, we added annotations to our final product (<a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>) intended to guard against interpretation of the knowledge map as a complete picture of every possible research output in the climate communication space.</p>

<h2 id="32-author-name-disambiguation">3.2 Author name disambiguation</h2>
<p>Because we wanted to produce a knowledge map of collaboration patterns within climate communication scholarship, we projected the bibliometric data from Web of Science into a co-authorship network, where nodes are individual scholars and links are formed between them when they write papers together. To present a clear co-authorship network, it is necessary to disambiguate author names<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fegley_etal2013"> [fegley_etal2013] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#harzing2015"> [harzing2015] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#milojevic2013"> [milojevic2013] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#strotmann_etal2012"> [strotmann_etal2012] </a>. Co-authorship network analysis rests on the assumption that there is one node for everyone in the network, but in reality, names are frequently split (identifying a single author as multiple authors) or merged (collapsing multiple individuals into a single mega-researcher)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#harzing2015"> [harzing2015] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#milojevic2013"> [milojevic2013] </a>. This can be due to inconsistent name spelling (for example the occasional omission of a middle initial), name change (for example due to a change in marital status), or database limitations and errors. Merged names are such a problem in bibliometrics that many databases contain entries for mega-authors who appear to publish multiple papers every day for years on end<a class="footnote-ref" href="#harzing2015"> [harzing2015] </a>. Clearly, the process of author name disambiguation has enormous ramifications for whose contributions are legible or visible in a knowledge network, and whose are not. Recent efforts to use unique author identifiers such as ORCIDs may eventually solve this problem, but they are not yet used widely enough to offer a practical author disambiguation solution.</p>
<p>Author network studies wishing to disambiguate name data face a choice: implement algorithmic disambiguation strategies of varying complexity or undertake the time-consuming process of manually disambiguating the data. Simple algorithmic disambiguation is the norm, partly due to research suggesting that more computationally or time intensive approaches don’t improve results<a class="footnote-ref" href="#milojevic2013"> [milojevic2013] </a>. Manual disambiguation is rare, though not unheard of; some find the time investment comparable to designing an algorithm, at least for up to about five thousand authors<a class="footnote-ref" href="#burckhardt2017"> [burckhardt2017] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fegley_etal2013"> [fegley_etal2013] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#strotmann_etal2009"> [strotmann_etal2009] </a>.</p>
<p>The simplest algorithmic approaches arefirst initialdisambiguation andall initialdisambiguation. A pattern of initials is selected and all names are converted to match this pattern (for example, a full author name being converted to first initial and full last name). First initial disambiguation is the most common but also the most fraught: split individuals change network statistics less overall than do merged authors, and first initial disambiguation’s weakness is that it merges many authors<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fegley_etal2013"> [fegley_etal2013] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#strotmann_etal2012"> [strotmann_etal2012] </a>. When authors are merged, their actual networks combine with others, sometimes resulting in the appearance of bridges connecting areas of the network that are actually distinct and making the mega-author seem like an important synthesizer of knowledge at a level that may not reflect reality<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2016"> [kim_etal2016] </a>. Networks containing many merged individuals become smaller, less transitive, denser, more productive, and more connected (or more frequently connected) than they actually are, and will have larger giant components<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2014b"> [kim_etal2014b] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2016"> [kim_etal2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fegley_etal2013"> [fegley_etal2013] </a>. Initials-based disambiguation has been shown to introduce error into the entire gamut of statistics describing network structure and function, including those assessing author productivity, collaboration patterns, and cohesion<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2016"> [kim_etal2016] </a>. Given the potential for harm inherent in miscalculating network statistics, both for evaluated individuals and for their broader knowledge community, we explored and visualized networks resulting from each of these disambiguation approaches so that we could make a clear determination of which strategy to use.</p>

<p>Very different pictures emerged when each of the four different disambiguation approaches was applied (<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>). Though the overall network is smaller, many more nodes are included in theFirst Initialgiant component than inFull Name,withAll Initialsfalling somewhere in the middle.<a href="#table01">Table 1</a>provides quantitative support for these visual impressions. The number of authors contained in the giant component and the number of links connecting them changes significantly, by hundreds of individuals in the overall network and by over a thousand individuals in the associated giant components. Most notable in<a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>is the fact that a salient feature of the manually disambiguated network, the bridge that spans from the left to the right of the giant component without traveling through the core, is not as clear in any of the networks generated from algorithmic disambiguation. But each of the networks appears individually reasonable, both from a network standpoint and a climate communication one. This makes it clear how researchers could (wittingly or unintentionally) select a disambiguation strategy that conveys a particular message. In this case, theFirst Initialnetwork suggests thriving exchange and dense connection,All Initialsoffers better-defined clusters, andFull Namepresents neat divisions between communities with just a few bridges between. It’s therefore important to be attentive to how interpretations may be influenced by visualization choices.<br>

Studies do not agree about which algorithmic disambiguation method is most effective at approximating the true network, though it’s been shown that between 8-39% of individuals in a dataset can be affected by merging or splitting<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2016"> [kim_etal2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#milojevic2013"> [milojevic2013] </a>. Estimates to quantify the amount of error often useFirst Initialdisambiguation as the lower limit of the range of error on the actual number of authors in the database, and ,All Initialsas the upper limit, but they do not usually visualize the resulting differences to see how more qualitative structural conclusions may be affected. Clearly, the success of a disambiguation strategy depends on meta-characteristics of the dataset itself. The most common example of this is the near-impossibility of using initials-based disambiguation on datasets with high participation from individuals with Chinese or Korean last names<a class="footnote-ref" href="#harzing2015"> [harzing2015] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2014b"> [kim_etal2014b] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kim_etal2016"> [kim_etal2016] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#milojevic2013"> [milojevic2013] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#strotmann_etal2012"> [strotmann_etal2012] </a>.</p>
<p>Even if it were possible to estimate the average distortion effects from different approaches to algorithmic disambiguation, it would be hard to predict which authors would be the most affected, meaning that analysis choices may have differential effects on different communities of scholars. Even if only a small percentage of error is introduced overall, that error may be distributed unevenly across the network, raising real concerns about whose and what types of contributions may be emphasized or obscured.<a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a>shows how different authors’ network positions are affected by different disambiguation strategies: node size changes (e.g., the node for S. Dessai), as does community membership (e.g., the node for S. Lewandowsky) and the visibility of underlying data errors (e.g., two nodes for E. Maibach linked together). The relative importance of nodes acting as brokers (large nodes here have high betweenness, one measure of a brokering role) changes too, and lumped or split authors open or close network pathways and affect community delineation.<a href="#table02">Table 2</a>shows how overall rankings of authors change order as nodes are merged or split.</p>
<p>If the goal of the network analysis is to be useful to the people represented, this sort of error can’t be waved away as acceptable distortion, and the only way to understand how such error affects an analysis is to visualize it and see. Though author disambiguation is rarely framed as an ethical issue, it clearly is one, as disambiguation strategies affect not only author rankings but the structural roles of authors in a network and the apparent structural function of the knowledge domain as a whole. In this case, we mitigated potential harm caused by inaccurate evaluations by building our final visualization on the manually disambiguated author dataset (though it’s important to note, there are almost certainly errors even in this carefully curated dataset). However, most knowledge mapping projects will not have the benefit of a manually disambiguated dataset to compare to. In those cases, the best thing to do is understand the potential consequences of choosing different disambiguation strategies and avoid over-interpreting the results.<br>

<h2 id="33-network-layout">3.3 Network layout</h2>

As with geographic maps, all strategies simplify and therefore distort certain aspects of the underlying data, meaning they should be undertaken intentionally and transparently to mitigate potential harm<a class="footnote-ref" href="#monmonier1991"> [monmonier1991] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#welles_etal2015"> [welles_etal2015] </a>. In this study, we applied graph theory informed transformations, which use relationship strength to infer the distance between nodes<a class="footnote-ref" href="#leydesdorff_etal2011"> [leydesdorff_etal2011] </a>. Layout algorithms use physics calculations to position nodes optimally, by first distributing them randomly in space and then balancing the repulsion between them, the attraction caused by links, and the gravity of the center of the graph, until an equilibrium is reached<a class="footnote-ref" href="#denooy_etal2011"> [denooy_etal2011] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fruchterman_etal1991"> [fruchterman_etal1991] </a>. Because the resulting network maps have similar intuitive visual force to a geographic map, they are subject to being produced and accepted uncritically.</p>
<p>Both researchers and viewers can be misled by network layouts that suggest patterns where there are none<a class="footnote-ref" href="#denooy_etal2011"> [denooy_etal2011] </a>. For example, theForce Atlas layoutallows longer edges between nodes than does theFruchterman Reingold layout, which emphasizes cohesion<a class="footnote-ref" href="#leydesdorff_etal2011"> [leydesdorff_etal2011] </a>.<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>illustrates how this changes the visual impression of the climate communication research network. Further complicating this is the possibility to mix and match layouts to achieve results that are different again from either layout method alone. Ultimately, it may be necessary to manually edit data to avoid misleading patterns such as criss-crossing links or overlapping nodes that could suggest incorrect inferences about network topology<a class="footnote-ref" href="#welles_etal2015"> [welles_etal2015] </a>. However, manual edits may distort embedded visual conventions which are based on math, such as distance representing dissimilarity, and so again these should be undertaken cautiously<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stephens_etal2016"> [stephens_etal2016] </a>.</p>
<p>For the climate communication knowledge map, we selected a layout produced by the Force Atlas algorithm and performed a small amount of editing to space out overlapping nodes and make the community size more interpretable to the human eye. In this case, our decision was less about mitigating potential harm and more about increasing understanding for viewers of the knowledge map while portraying the communities as legible groups of individuals. However,<a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>makes it clear that some layouts will emphasize connectivity and cohesiveness, and others will emphasize distance, despite that they are views of the same set of nodes and relationships. This illustrates that there is no option to choose an objective view of a network dataset, so the onus is on the researcher to make layout choices intentionally, as these arguments can have consequences for individuals and communities depicted. It also shows that just like datasets, tools for visualizing data can make implicit arguments which must be considered carefully.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="34-community-detection">3.4 Community detection</h2>
<p>After the network layout is complete, it is customary to divide the nodes into communities using algorithms such as Louvain community detection, a modularity maximization algorithm that identifies communities by finding groups of nodes sharing frequent connections within their group, but as few as possible connections to other communities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#blondel_etal2008"> [blondel_etal2008] </a>. Even scientifically minded knowledge mappers tend to acknowledge that interpreting the results of a community detection algorithm is an iterative process, and as much an art as a science. Interpretation generally draws on non-network attributes (for example, researcher discipline) as well as network metrics like those in<a href="#table01">Table 1</a>, to explicate the identified community structure. In the climate communication dataset, traditional strategies like summarizing purely by author keywords were minimally successful, as single occurrences of keywords were the norm (e.g., one primary community had 511 author-provided keywords describing 240 published works, but 388 of the keywords were used only once).</p>
<p>This illustrates the conundrum of categorization that is well-recognized in ethical visualization and data feminism: by placing nodes into groups, the knowledge map makes a strong argument that there is some inherent quality of those nodes that justifies their grouping, despite that the underlying data is not always so decisive. This is especially so when the network has been filtered to represent connections above a certain strength, such as authors that have collaborated at least twice, or papers that have been cited together at least ten times. This common practice eases the computational task of creating and analyzing the networks, but it also makes it easier to identify communities that seem much less interconnected than they actually are (or, conversely, give too much weight to connections which are strongly present based on the visualized logic, but which may be essentially meaningless in the real world).<a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>demonstrates how clear communities become at different levels of filtering, offering another example of how seemingly technical choices made in knowledge network design make implicit arguments. Another way of saying this is that determinations of exactly what is signal and what is noise in a network dataset are subjective considerations.</p>
<p>In the climate communication knowledge map, we attempted to moderate the visual force of the communities by providing extensive annotations on their composition, and by resisting giving the threecorecommunities particular names that were simply not justified by their heterogeneous compositions.</p>

<h2 id="35-ground-truth-or-trust">3.5 Ground truth or trust?</h2>
<p>Each of the previous sections has emphasized the constructedness of knowledge maps, demonstrating that every step in the production of a knowledge map entails subjective and value-laden judgments which foreground or obscure elements of the depicted knowledge domain and therefore run the risk of perpetuating different types of harm. Issues of data selection, disambiguation, layout, and community detection processes combine to make it difficult to validate or ground truth a network map. But it’s worth asking, given the constructedness and subjectivity of a knowledge map, whether a ground truth would even be meaningful.</p>
<p>The traditional sense of a ground truth – going to a particular spot on a landscape and confirming that reality matches modeled values – is probably going to fail for knowledge maps. Though they should absolutely be intelligible to members of the depicted community, it is unlikely that every scholar would agree with the version of reality presented in the chart. Knowledge maps approximate a consensus about knowledge structure based on authorship and citation data, but this is knowledge on average. Individual experts may or may not agree, and the knowledge map may not be a good representation of an individual’s subjective experience of the knowledge domain, or even of the specific connections depicted based on their existing co-author relationships, since a network represents a diversity of connections as a single type of link. In the absence of a ground truth, perhaps a more important question to ask is how a network visualization can become trustworthy.</p>
<p>While building the climate communication knowledge map, we learned that the only way to produce trustworthy maps is to have attention to ethical dimensions and potentials for harm at every step of the design process. This can be accomplished with vigilance for implicit arguments made by customary analysis choices and tools, with the inclusion of annotations and caveats in the visualization, and by remaining constantly aware that any purely data-driven view of a knowledge domain will be partial. The key utility of ethical visualization perspectives in the development of the climate communication knowledge map was to push back against our worries that we were somehow biasing our results in an inappropriate way by making these human-driven choices surrounding data curation and presentation. In the next section, we offer suggestions for how to apply these perspectives in future knowledge mapping projects.</p>
<h2 id="4-strategies-for-ethical-and-effective-visualization-of-knowledge-networks">4. Strategies for ethical and effective visualization of knowledge networks</h2>
<p>Ethical and effective visualizations of knowledge networks must inspire trust in two key groups: people depicted in the knowledge map, and people using the map to acquire knowledge or make decisions. We draw on our experience in the climate communication knowledge mapping project and on previous work on ethical visualization in the digital humanities to offer ethical visualization strategies for network data and knowledge maps specifically. This represents an important step indownscalingrecommendations from ethical visualization and data feminism to demonstrate their application and utility in specific projects. We encourage readers to consult other literature on ethical visualization (especially<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lima2011"> [lima2011] </a>and<a class="footnote-ref" href="#garilova_etal2019"> [garilova_etal2019] </a>for discussions of additional visual conventions specific to the design of network charts.</p>
<p>Our recommendations are intended to assist researchers in balancing tensions between quantitative and qualitative, and objective and subjective, aspects of knowledge mapping. We advocate a humanistic approach to visualization design, recognizing that working with this type of data successfully requires coupling quantitative fluency with the more humanities-oriented practice of contextualizing findings, and tolerance for and transparency around the trial-and-error approach necessary to creating a useful product<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conway2014"> [conway2014] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dragga_etal2011"> [dragga_etal2011] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#drucker2011"> [drucker2011] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hepworth_etal2018"> [hepworth_etal2018] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#stephens_etal2016"> [stephens_etal2016] </a>. As the climate communication knowledge mapping project illustrates, a purely quantitative, purely objective depiction of a knowledge network is neither possible nor particularly useful.</p>
<h2 id="41-understand-knowledge-maps-as-both-process-and-product">4.1 Understand knowledge maps as both process and product</h2>
<p>Knowledge maps have a dual purpose: they are a tool used in studying knowledge domains, and a visual artifact representing those domains. The first focuses primarily on creating knowledge and insight for the immediate researchers involved and can be best understood as a process. The second focuses primarily on assisting others in gaining insight into the mapped domain, and can be best understood as a product. However, as the climate communication knowledge map makes clear, these two types of knowledge mapping are generally impossible to separate: knowledge mapping proceeds in an iterative and exploratory fashion, where impressions gained in experimenting with different analyses and layouts inform the final version of the map, and where the layout of the map informs a researcher’s conclusions. Franco Moretti described this as a “heterogeneity of problem and solution” in distant reading; we argue that the same applies to knowledge mapping<a class="footnote-ref" href="#moretti2007"> [moretti2007] </a>. In the case of the climate communication knowledge map, the desire to create a particular kind of product (a useful and trustworthy knowledge map to support collaboration and discovery in a particular knowledge community) influenced the process of data preparation and analysis, for example leading to the decision to manually disambiguate data, which in turn affected analytical results.</p>
<p>The intertwining of product and process does not guarantee that a good product will follow from a sound process (or that an apparently good product was generated with a sound process). For example, we often observe knowledge maps developed primarily to facilitate analysis being included in research reports. In these cases, researchers have generally extracted meaning from the visualization to support their interpretations. However, without adjustment, these visualizations often remain incomprehensible to those outside the research team. We suggest that ethical and effective knowledge mappers should remain aware of how process and product intertwine in a knowledge mapping project, and how this can both enhance and trouble the process of producing a knowledge map for use beyond the research team.</p>
<h2 id="42-translate-and-annotate-knowledge-maps">4.2 Translate and annotate knowledge maps</h2>
<p>Anecdotally, we learned while developing and sharing the climate communication knowledge maps that despite their visual and rhetorical force, viewers are often unsure how to understand these charts. We also learned that, once viewers felt they understood what the nodes and connections and color scheme meant, they quickly formed and held onto inaccurate impressions about what the chart conveyed. While it is not possible to moderate the rhetorical force of a visualization entirely, it is possible to embed guidelines and caveats for interpretation that guide viewers towards the interpretations intended by the visualization designer. This does not preclude the viewer reaching their own conclusions; rather, it fulfills the promise of a knowledge map as a communication tool. Ethical and effective knowledge mappers should take the opportunity to translate and annotate a knowledge map, asking themselves which insights have the most rhetorical force, and which may need to be moderated with caveats. This is why the knowledge maps presented in this paper include textual information about their genesis and interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="43-account-for-implicit-arguments-made-by-network-theory-tools-and-data-sources">4.3 Account for implicit arguments made by network theory, tools, and data sources</h2>
<p>A common practice in data feminism is to disclose the positionality of the researchers, so that viewers of the resulting data visualizations might understand how researchers’ perspectives and life experiences may influence their understandings of the phenomena portrayed. We encourage knowledge mappers to consider not just their own positionality, but the positionality of network theory, tools, and data sources when drawing conclusions from a knowledge mapping project.</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to consider the implicit arguments made by networks themselves. A network chart necessarily conveys a message of connection, especially since unconnected elements are generally omitted from analysis. Network thinking is fundamentally structuralist, meaning that it privileges relationships over attributes and affords the system a level of agency that it may or may not have<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conway2014"> [conway2014] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gouchenour2011"> [gouchenour2011] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#moretti2007"> [moretti2007] </a>. A consequence of this structuralist lens is that disconnection is seen as undesirable, and distinctions between quality and quantity are often blurred<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gouchenour2011"> [gouchenour2011] </a>. The focus on quantitatively (but possibly not qualitatively) strong connections (after all, there are many ways to become connected in a coauthor network that do not necessarily represent close collaboration) extends to the way networks are generally depicted, showing nodes connected only above a certain link strength threshold (as in<a href="#figure05">Figure 5</a>). The assumption that weak connections are just noise to be removed, and that strong connections are the defining structural feature of a network, means this type of analysis may miss cutting-edge or non-standard knowledge patterns.</p>
<p>Subsequently, it is important to disclose the tools used for analysis and, especially, for visualization. Because the visualization tools actively shape the conclusions of the analysis (<a href="#four-one">as discussed in 4.1</a>), it is important to be transparent about how this may have occurred even if the effects are not apparent to the research team<a class="footnote-ref" href="#vangeenen_etal2020"> [vangeenen_etal2020] </a>. None of this threatens the utility of network analysis as a tool for understanding a system of related data, but it should serve as a reminder of network thinking’s assumptions, so they are not incorporated uncritically into a knowledge map. An ethical and effective knowledge mapper should be aware of inherent implications stemming from choices about the theory, tools, and data sources which feed into resulting visualizations.</p>
<h2 id="44-consider-impacts-on-people-depicted">4.4 Consider impacts on people depicted</h2>
<p>Knowledge networks are often assumed to be exempt from privacy concerns because they are constructed from published works. It’s important to remember that a network (especially the co-author networks presented in this paper) is made up of individual people. Certain nodes may assume standout roles that wouldn’t be apparent in a list of search results or even in tabular data, and certain patterns of connection may occur that do not represent current relationships and collaborations. Because there is no objective way to characterize node roles or performance, or even which nodes trulybelongin a network, caution is warranted incalling outspecific people depicted, or associating merit with network position alone<a class="footnote-ref" href="#furner2014"> [furner2014] </a>. It may sometimes be preferable to display anonymized data (for example by grouping nodes into communities) to guard against incorrect or harmful interpretations about individuals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s precisely the transparency and associated lack of anonymity that can make knowledge network tools useful. Laura Kati Corlew and her team relied on this in building a network mapping and knowledge discovery tool for climate workers in the Pacific Islands<a class="footnote-ref" href="#corlew_etal2015"> [corlew_etal2015] </a>. The correct balance of privacy and publicity will need to be determined on a project-by-project basis. Asking questions about who benefits from the network depiction of participants can help navigate these tensions<a class="footnote-ref" href="#conway2014"> [conway2014] </a>. In the case of the climate communication knowledge map, we felt that attention to data selection and disambiguation mitigated some concerns about privacy for network participants and so we labeled key nodes with names. Climate communicators are likely familiar with these scholars and can use them as landmarks to support orientation and sense-making while they interact with the knowledge map.</p>
<p>As knowledge maps proliferate, they may be used increasingly for evaluation and analysis, and so an ethical and effective knowledge mapper should consider the potential ramifications of such a map having a life of its own after publication, and the possible agendas users might bring to interpretation of these visualizations, especially when choosing to use personally identifying data in a knowledge map.</p>
<h2 id="45-put-your-cards-on-the-table">4.5 Put your cards on the table</h2>
<p>The final strategy for ethical and effective visualization of knowledge networks is inspired by data feminism’s maxim of showing one’s work<a class="footnote-ref" href="#dignazio_etal2020"> [dignazio_etal2020] </a>. We encourage ethical and effective knowledge mappers to put their cards on the table alongside their produced visualizations. This means being completely transparent about what you did, why you did it, and how you did it, but also about what insights you identify or arguments you wish to make with your produced visualization. Work in ethical visualization and data feminism has shown real drawbacks to obscuring the work done to produce a data visualization, to attempting to let data speak for itself. Ethical and effective knowledge mappers must resist the temptation to keep analysis and interpretation behind the curtain, recognizing that doing so may hinder precisely the type of knowledge creation and discovery they are likely trying to support.</p>
<p>The first way to put your cards on the table is to make analysis decisions transparent, as we have done in this article. This may be done in scholarly publications, or in metadata and annotations accompanying published visualizations. Like disclosing positionalities, articulating the strategies used to create visualization products reveals implicit impressions the designer may not have been aware of, but which could be important to viewers. Sharing this information safeguards transparency by aiding other researchers in creating similar maps, should they wish to.</p>
<p>The second way to put your cards on the table is to tell the story you as the researcher see in the visualization. What insight were you seeking that led you to build the knowledge map? Did you find evidence for it, or against it? Narratives explicate network structure and concepts in an intuitive way, guiding viewers to reasonable scales of interpretation and guarding against out-of-context presentations of the knowledge network. They can also shed light on what the system diagram on its own might not reveal clearly, such as a possible function of or reason for absent links between authors or communities.</p>
<p>There is a fine line to walk here, given that the point of visual communication is simplicity. Over-annotating a visualization might make it harder to engage with. We attempted to address this in our final knowledge map (<a href="#figure06">Figure 6</a>) by providing a below-the-fold presentation of narrative context for the network. Other network projects, especially interactive ones, may discover additional ways to support the juxtaposition of narrative and network.</p>

<h2 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>We began this paper with the observation that scholars have long been captivated by the quest to develop high-tech tools for information management and knowledge synthesis. From the vantage point of the 21st century, we recognize that the success of these tools is not simply a matter of technological progress, but one that requires ethical thought. Just as a network mapping platform like Gephi provides the technical tools for working with big network data, an ethical visualization framework provides the ethical tools for reducing the harm and increasing the impact of knowledge maps – essentially, for making them deliver on their promise of augmenting our perceptual abilities when faced with large and complex information spaces. In this paper, we have drawn on lessons learned in the climate communication knowledge mapping project to offer strategies for ethical and effective visualizations of knowledge networks. This approach acknowledges the potential for harm that comes with such visualizations and works actively to mitigate it. Taking an ethical approach to knowledge mapping is vital because the choices made in such an analysis determine whose and which contributions are ultimately legible.</p>
<p>We have attempted to provide guidelines for knowledge mappers seeking to support users in synthesizing and selecting meaningful insights from the mapped domain. Our recommendations balance tensions between qualitative and quantitative and objective and subjective aspects of knowledge mapping. They demonstrate the importance of critical practices in the development of knowledge maps, illustrate the intertwined nature of analysis and results in such projects, and emphasize the constructedness of the visualization. We show the only way to produce an effective knowledge map is to produce an ethical one, which requires attention to the ways trust and accountability can be produced at every step of analysis and production.</p>
<p>This framework for ethical visualization of knowledge networks contributes to early conversations about a feminist bibliometrics and demonstrates the direct relevance of digital humanities tools to work carried out across diverse other fields. Connecting bibliometrics literature with digital humanities discourse invites more qualitative and interpretive perspectives into bibliometric knowledge mapping, demonstrating that the data-centric and science-focused techniques frequently applied to knowledge network visualization may fail to produce a useful and impactful portrait of a knowledge domain without attending to these ethical concerns. A central purpose of this paper is to offer a clear example of the utility of a critical approach to knowledge mapping in a traditional knowledge mapping project.</p>
<p>The idea of separating wheat from chaff is a common trope in knowledge mapping. While knowledge mapping can absolutely facilitate discovery of relevant or applicable knowledge, assuming this is its key strength overlooks its real potential. Essentially, a system-level depiction may provoke a reassessment of what is wheat and what is chaff, and recognition that these designations are situation-dependent. As knowledge production increases and we continue to rely on quantitative and visual tools to help us navigate information spaces, it may be best to abandon the threshing trope and instead adopt a more kaleidoscopic model of knowledge mapping’s goals. Knowledge maps provide meaningful and multipurpose ways for individuals to explore a knowledge domain, and different individuals may need to turn the kaleidoscope in unique ways to find useful or compelling information and explanations which gel with, and usefully complement, their own experiences of a knowledge network.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the difficulties encountered in research on Dance Studies, and especially in dance history, is the ephemeral condition of the object of study. Due to the impossibility of direct access to the primary source, which is the original performance of the dance work, it is necessary to trace its origin through the artistic, written, musical or audiovisual materials that have been preserved. The study of sketches of sets, costumes, scores, choreographic notation, films, sound recordings, librettos, newspaper reviews and documents, among others, will show the contribution made by each dance work when it was premiered. This information is the primary basis on which to establish the subsequent interpretive analysis. The frequent dispersion of these materials, as well as their poor preservation or loss, together with a short academic tradition and scarce research in certain contexts, mean that large gaps still exist in dance history. This is even more evident in the Spanish academic context in relation to dance research. Despite artistic manifestations such as flamenco, which was awarded UNESCO&rsquo;s World Heritage status in 2010, and other dance jewels, such as the bolero — a dance form legacy from the eighteenth century — Dance Studies are not established in the university system. Besides, research in dance history is still limited and depends on other humanistic and artistic disciplines. Therefore, the advance in the application of new methods in Digital Humanities and their open access offers great potential for research into the history of Spanish dance, increasing the level of interpretation of the preserved sources, and the possibilities of integration and impact on international art history narratives, from which it has traditionally been excluded.</p>
<p>This article presents the case study of the research project <em>Ballets Españoles (1927-1929): A Dance Company for the Internationalisation of Modern Art</em> (ref. ERC2018-092829), aimed at analysing the impact of transnational modern and avant-garde art and interdisciplinary creation that was disseminated through the Ballets Espagnols, the dance company founded by Antonia Mercé, aka La Argentina (Buenos Aires, 1890-Bordeaux, 1936). This group, which was active between 1927 and 1929, was the first to produce aSpanish-styleversion of the model of Sergei Diaghilev&rsquo;s successful Ballets Russes, which had dazzled Western audiences and critics since 1909 with its repertoire of ballets by the most outstanding creators and intellectuals, such as Igor Stravinsky, Pablo Picasso, Natalia Goncharova, Manuel de Falla, Vaslav and Bronislava Nijinska, among many others.</p>

<p>Diaghilev&rsquo;s previous success encouraged the foundation of other groups that examined their respective roots and national identities in order to propose modern pieces, which include the Ballets Suédois, Ballets Romantiques Russes, Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo and, in this case, the Ballets Espagnols. In these works, La Argentina surrounded herself with outstanding Spanish musicians, painters and writers in the creation of a repertoire based on Spanish cultural legacies. Some of her most outstanding works were <em>El amor brujo, El fandango de candil, Au coeur de Seville (Cuadro flamenco), Juerga, Sonatina</em> and <em>Triana.</em> Over the years she had the support of writers such as Cipriano de Rivas Cherif, Federico García Lorca and Tomás Borras; musicians such as Manuel de Falla, Ernesto Halffter, Julián Bautista, Joaquín Turina and Enrique Fernández-Arbós; stage designers such as Néstor, Gustavo Bacarisas, Manuel Fontanals and Mariano Andreu; and dancers such as Vicente Escudero, Carmita García, Pastora Imperio and Miguel de Molina. The transcendence of these names in their respective areas highlights the impact of the Russian model. Considering a ballet as atotal work of art— derived from Richard Wagner&rsquo;s <em>gesamtkunswerg —</em> different elements were entrusted to outstanding personalities of their field with a certain innovative and modern outlook. Moreover, the company united examples of the most outstanding contributions of the arts and literature of the time, in what Spanish historiography considers the so-called Generations of 1898, 1914 and 1927. These protagonists of the movement of cultural renewal would constitute the period know as the Silver Age, interrupted by the military uprising that started the Spanish Civil War on 18 July, 1936, the same day on which Antonia Mercé La Argentina died suddenly of a heart attack.</p>
<p>The Ballets Espagnols were conceived mainly for a foreign audience and the ensemble never performed in Spain, making internationalisation a key element in understanding the acceptance of Spanish dance and its legacy in the memory of Western dance from then on. Despite the repercussion that both Antonia Mercé and her company had on Spanish dance, no monographic study of the Ballets Espagnols existed to date. Only some studies examine her biography and trajectory, and some articles and books propose readings of her context.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Therefore, this research sought to locate, analyse and interpret the Ballets Espagnols repertoire in order to assess its impact on the definition of Spanish imaginaries through the modern interpretation of interwar Europe.</p>
<p>It was therefore essential to have a tool that would enable the systematic examination of the preserved sources of diverse typology located in different countries. Besides, it was also possible to analyse the presence of this company in very specific sections using spatiotemporal coordinates. The research project was carried out between 2018 and 2020 within the framework of the State Programme for the Promotion of Scientific and Technical Research of Excellence, under Europe Excellence Dynamization Actions of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, at the Department of Art History and Heritage of the Institute of History of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), in collaboration with the Unit of Geographic Information Systems and Digital Humanities at the Centre for Human and Social Sciences. Part of this work has also been continued in a new research project, entitled <em>Dance Studies and Digital Humanities</em> (ref. 202010E150), undertaken by the CSIC, which seeks to extend the development and application of these tools to research into Spanish dance history, and which is running from 2020 to 2023. The main aim is to share the results of this study in the application of Digital Humanities in dance, and specifically, for future research in the rich field of Spanish dance and its various aspects including flamenco, bolero, folk dances and stylised dance.</p>
<h2 id="2-dance-studies-and-digital-humanities-a-growing-relationship">2. Dance Studies and Digital Humanities: a growing relationship</h2>
<p>The application of Digital Humanities to dance has become a fertile field for the advancement of knowledge in a discipline traditionally very attached to physical, oral and face-to-face transmission through body language techniques. Paradoxically, the context of extended reality is offering new advantages for areas of historical research, such as the recovery and reconstruction of dance heritage.</p>
<p>Many initiatives along these lines are currently being carried out, such as the projects developed at Florida State University with the ViFlow augmented reality platform for dance<a class="footnote-ref" href="#vvaa2016"> [vvaa2016] </a>or the completed <em>WhoLoDance (Whole-body Interaction Learning for Dance Education)</em> <a class="footnote-ref" href="#vvaa2018"> [vvaa2018] </a>, as well as various international conferences specialised in the relationship between the performing arts and technology: <em>International Conference on Movement and Computing</em> (MOCO) and <em>Conference for Research in Choreographic Interfaces</em> (CRCI). It is important to highlight the specialised spaces that host these interdisciplinary works, such as the Google Arts &amp; Culture Lab, New Frontier Artist Residency Programme (Sundance) or Advanced Computing Centre for the Arts and Design (ACCAD, The Ohio State University).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> In Spain, these spaces include the <em>Aula de las Artes</em> Art and Science Platform of the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and the Dance and New Media Lab (DANM) of the Etopia Art and Technology Centre in the city of Zaragoza.</p>
<p>Regarding exploration of new software for performing arts research along the lines oftheatre analytics<a class="footnote-ref" href="#bardiot2020"> [bardiot2020] </a>and its assessment of the complexity of the associated data, different projects are exploring the relationships and exchanges that link the ephemeral with the permanent, the physical with the virtual. Some current initiatives are based on the development of digital archives, such as <em>Siobhan Davies Replay</em> : <em>The Archive of Siobhan Davies Dance</em> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> or the Carmen Beuchat Archive.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, Digital Humanities have provided fundamental tools for the assessment of the spatiotemporal coordinates in dance history research, focusing on the evidence preserved through interactive mapping. Of particular importance are the contributions of Harmony Bench (Ohio University) and Kate Elswit (Royal Central School of Speech and Drama) whose application of new digital research methodologies in conjunction with traditional tools have made it possible to manage, analyse and compare on a large scale the vast amount of data obtained on the different tours of dance companies in the twentieth century, giving rise to what has become known as “dynamic spatial histories of movement” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#bench2016"> [bench2016] </a>. <em>Moving Bodies, Moving Culture</em> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> follows the American Ballet Caravan company on its tours of Latin America during the 1940s; <em>Mapping Touring</em> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> presents a database accessible through a map viewer containing the performances of various dancers, choreographers and companies from the turn of the century, such as Ruth Saint Denis, Ted Shawn, Erick Hawkins, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo or Original Ballet Russe. Finally, the tours made by the African-American dancer and choreographer Katherine Dunham between the 1930s and 1960s illustrate the recent project <em>Dance in Transit and Dunham&rsquo;s Data: Katherine Dunham and Digital Methods for Dance Historical Inquiry.</em> <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="3-materials-and-methods">3. Materials and methods</h2>
<p>The implementation of a Digital Humanities project of this nature requires addressing the systematisation of information by designing and creatingdata models.This is what is known, generically, as the description of theuniverse of discourseor the part of the real world we wish to study and represent<a class="footnote-ref" href="#flanders2015"> [flanders2015] </a>. The data modelling process involves identifying the most relevant entities or classes in our project and describing their main features and the connections between them.</p>
<p>Data modelling is a current topic of discussion in Digital Humanities. Its definition, within this spectrum, is not very different from the one usually used in computer sciences. There are authors who believe that data modelling should be one of the main tasks of research projects in humanities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jannidis2013"> [jannidis2013] </a>. Nevertheless, neither a theory nor extensive scientific literature on the subject is apparent, perhaps because it is believed that there is already enough in the field of computer technologies. Data modelling, in Humanities, is understood as aninterpretationof an object, both in the real and virtual world; a constructive and creative process in which the functions of digital technology determine which aspects should be modelled<a class="footnote-ref" href="#flanders2015"> [flanders2015] </a>. Nowadays, data modelling is applied more and more frequently and is a prior and indispensable step in systematising information in Digital Humanities projects. This is well summarised in the work of Ciula &amp; Marras (<a href="#ciula2016">2016</a>), which highlights the upward trajectory of works that incorporate these technologies to develop their research. Two phases must be distinguished in data modelling: on the one hand, design modelling, which describes the entities from the universe of discourse with which we are going to work; and on the other hand, logical modelling, which is the implementation of the former in a database environment.</p>
<p>Within the framework of our research project, we have undertaken a joint work process between the mentioned research group and the technology unit of Geographic Information Systems and Digital Humanities CCHS-CSIC, the latter having extensive experience in the modelling of scientific data<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fernandezfreire2013"> [fernandezfreire2013] </a>.</p>
<p>Data systematisation involved designing a model containing the classes, possible relationships and properties of our information. The extensive collection was extracted from diverse sources, from national and international institutions, and will provide support for future consultations, studies, spatiotemporal analyses and visualisations to understand the contributions of the repertoire and the performances of the Ballets Espagnols and the individual recitals of Antonia Mercé La Argentina.</p>
<p>The data modelling of our project has been carried out according to the UML (Unified Modelling Language) standard. Being an internationally used language, it enables our work to be understandable, scalable and reusable by any other researcher working on a related topic. Despite the potential of UML, its extension within the humanities is relatively limited. For several years, XML has been used for work in the field of text editing and analysis. There are therefore several examples of transformation of literary works to XML format<a class="footnote-ref" href="#kimber2000"> [kimber2000] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hayashi2001"> [hayashi2001] </a>and their storage in TEI format<a class="footnote-ref" href="#teehan2010"> [teehan2010] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#portela2015"> [portela2015] </a>. These works have approached this technology from the perspective of text analysis, semantic web and ontologies, as well as extraction of annotations from ancient documents through a UML schema<a class="footnote-ref" href="#luzzi2012"> [luzzi2012] </a>. More recently, there has been an updated volume<a class="footnote-ref" href="#schraibman2016"> [schraibman2016] </a>dedicated exclusively to Digital Humanities that explores through authors, pioneers in research in this field, the infrastructures, creation, analysis, dissemination and future of Digital Humanities itself.</p>
<p>The class diagram that describes our universe of discourse, within the framework of this art and dance history project, takes into account the georeferenced nature of the data and has been implemented in a database through an Entity-Relationship model using a free software management system, PostgreSQL and the PostGIS spatial extension. This &ldquo;spatial&rdquo; database structure offers not only the power of SQL queries, but also the possibility of integration in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for subsequent spatiotemporal analysis and the generation of maps and dynamic visualisations.</p>
<p>This potential also extends to the development of different forms of access, for example through a map viewer, and the reuse of the information generated by other researchers or a more general public. Thanks to the georeferenced nature of the data, web map services have been implemented that comply with the regulations and standardisation of spatial data (in particular with the specifications of the Open Geospatial Consortium), as well as other types of access to the data, still to be determined, always in an open science context<a class="footnote-ref" href="#delbosquegonzalez2020"> [delbosquegonzalez2020] </a>, protecting their authorship as recommended for scientific research. Since 2017, and with the aim of enhancing and developing this philosophy, the European Commission has stipulated that all publicly funded projects guarantee free access to research data under the FAIR Principles (acronym for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). For data generated in scientific research<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wilkinson2016"> [wilkinson2016] </a>, the FAIR Principles are already an institutional mandate in some organisations such as the CSIC and a framework by which we intend to abide in this project.</p>
<p>In order to fulfil those principles, the dataset<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> generated within this project has been metadated according to ISO 19119 and incorporated into a public metadata catalogue, making datafindablethrough web searches. Data are alsoaccessiblein an open spatial format such as GeoJSON and interoperable thanks to the above-mentioned Web Map Service, described in a standard language that enables linkage to other projects regardless of protocols, software or operating systems. The creative commons (by-nc-sa) licencing grants reuse to other researchers as long as terms such as attribution are observed.</p>
<h2 id="31-data-model">3.1. Data model</h2>
<p>The data model of “Los Ballets Espagnols y los recitales individuales de Antonia Mercé, la Argentina” solves the integration of very diverse data, ranging from the georeferencing of theatres to the elements related to the scenography or the different recordings, including the authors and performers of the works. The whole set of data revolves around the primary information obtained through the programmes of the different performances, the central node that structures all the information that has been collected<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> :</p>

<p>As has been stated, the main sources are the shows’ handbills preserved from various locations. The information they contain has been broken down into many items to enable atomized database storage that ensures the implementation of complex queries and their versatility.</p>
<p>The logic of the model starts from a show that takes place in a specific location and on specific dates. A show is made up of musical numbers in which a fragment of a play is enacted by a series of performers (dancers, musicians and conductor). Musical numbers may have been filmed by an author, and that footage may be kept in a private or public collection. Handbills and posters made for each show are also registered, along with their physical description, and location of known copies. The classPlayregisters all information regarding the original play: title, authors, and date. Each piece of information related to the show’s development is detailed as a specialization of the classComponent.There are many components in a show: set design, models, choreographies, costumes, librettos and scores. Their authors, title (if applicable), current location, date and dimensions (if applicable) are registered, along with information about formats, techniques (if applicable) and, for scores, recordings if any.</p>
<p>The following two aspects of the components of each show should be highlighted: whether it is possible to specify their current location (for example, in a museum or collection) and the existence of copies.</p>
<p>The data model acknowledges two types of people: authors and performers. Basic biodata on both is registered, plus their specialty. The whole project is geographically pinned whenever the information can be spatialized: current location of the show’s components, handbills, posters, recordings, footage and most significantly, the location of theatres where the shows took place. Locations of all kinds are managed through the class &ldquo;Place&rdquo;, where a point is stored in geographic WGS84 coordinates. All places are attached to the worldwide locations layer downloaded from Natural Earth’s (<a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">https://www.naturalearthdata.com/</a>) populated places and subsequently to a country. This way the spatial component enables future queries to be aggregated by country or locality.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that many theatres no longer exist, thorough research has yielded an accurate position for almost all of them. In that case the generic locality’s coordinates taken from the Natural Earth layer are displayed in the map. Although this is a data model designed for this project, we believe that the development of sufficiently generic classes and the introspection carried out on the nature of the information make it an easily reusable model for any other project in the same field.</p>
<p>The implementation of the model has consisted of the direct development of an Entity-Relationship model adjusted to the definition of classes. Given the need for a geographic data manager and the potential use of the database in online projects, it was decided to host the model in a PostgreSQL Database Management System (DBMS) with its PostGIS spatial extension. All coordinates have been defined in geographical WGS84. Access to basic Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations has been enabled through the development of a web interface in PHP. This allows the project researchers to maintain and extend the database.</p>

<h2 id="32-workflow">3.2. Workflow</h2>
<p>The database has been completed with the help of the developed tools, adding plays, authors, performers, programmes, etc. The location of the theatres was first carried out using a geocoding service, but has finally required an exhaustive revision through searches on Google Maps and in some cases more specific revisions when the theatre has disappeared or its name has been altered. In any case, all theatre locations refer to a GIS layer of places, so that in cases where it has been impossible to obtain the exact location of a venue, the coordinates of the centroid of the place in which it is located are used (this is the case of 3 theatres out of a total of 115).</p>
<p>The developed system (database + user interface) has been the tool to systematise the large amount of dispersed materials and documentation currently held in different international institutions, such as libraries, archives, museums and documentation centres. The collections held in the institutions listed below were consulted during the development of the project:<br>
Archives and documentation centresArchivo Carlos Manso (Buenos Aires, Argentina)A private collection by this relevant former dancer and researcher, author of <em>La Argentina, fue Antonia Mercé</em> (Buenos Aires, Devenir, 1993). It includes written and graphic sources.American Foundation for the Blind, Helen Keller Archive (New York, USA)The collection of this feminist, suffragist, social activist and pacifist author contains some written sources related to La Argentina.Archives de La Monnaie (Brussels, Belgium)It contains some materials related to the Ballets Espagnols tours in the Théàtre de La Monnaie in 1928.Archivo Fundación Zuloaga (Zumaia, Spain)One of the family archives related to the painter Ignacio Zuloaga contains several written sources.Archivo Histórico Nacional (Madrid, Spain)This state archive gathers written sources linked to Antonia Mercé and some creators of her time.Archivo Manuel de Falla (Granada, Spain)Focused on the collection of the musician, it conserves written, graphic and musical sources, including letters, librettos, scores, photographs and other documents.Archivo Pablo Suero (Buenos Aires, Argentina)It conserves the private archive of this Spanish-born writer and journalist established in Argentina, which contains several letters and articles linked to Antonia Mercé.Archivo Regional de la Comunidad de Madrid (Madrid, Spain)This archive conserves several written and graphic sources, including programs, posters, photographs and scores, some of which are part of the Juan María Martínez de Bourio collection.Archivo Sáenz de Tejada (Laguardia, Spain):The private collection of the family of the painter Carlos Sáenz de Tejada, a painter and scenographer of Antonia Mercé. Some of the consulted works during the research were recently incorporated into the collections of the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía.Centre de Documentació i Museu de les Arts Escèniques, Institut del Teatre (Barcelona, Spain)One of the main research centres for performing arts in Spain, it contains one of the principal collections about Antonia Mercé, including written and graphic sources, original costumes and personal items.Centro de Documentación de las Artes Escénicas y de la Música, INAEM (Madrid, Spain)This state archive includes a significant number of publications and some original written sources.LibrariesBiblioteca Fundación Juan March (Madrid, Spain)One of the main institutions that conserves the largest collection donated by Antonia Mercé&rsquo;s niece, Carlota Mercé de Pavloff, &ldquo;Fondo Antonia Mercé la Argentina&rdquo;. It contains the original scrapbooks by the choreographer, as well as photographs, letters, musical recordings, documents, and a wide range of publications.Biblioteca Nacional de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain)It holds some written sources, mainly correspondence from Antonia Mercé and her manager, Arnold Meckel.Biblioteca Nacional de España (Madrid, Spain)It conserves original sketches, scores, librettos, footage, letters, press clippings, and the most important bibliography about the choreographer.Biblioteca Tomás Navarro Tomás, Centro de Ciencias Humanas y Sociales, CSIC (Madrid, Spain)It contains a wide range of publications about performing arts, related to dance research currently being undertaken at the History of Art and Heritage Department at the History Institute.Bibliothèque Nationale de France (Paris, France)The &ldquo;Fonds Argentina&rdquo; at the Bibliothèque-Musée de l&rsquo;Opéra contain the most important collection of materials about the choreographer, including: manuscripts, programs, photographs, posters, costumes, other objects, paintings, and press clippings. Besides, there are more materials conserved at the Département des Arts du Spectacle, mainly costumes, personal souvenirs, portraits, sound recordings, and other graphic sources. They were donations by the dancer&rsquo;s family, the Association des Amis d&rsquo;Argentina, Auguste Rondel and others.Filipinas Heritage Library (Manila, Philippines)Bibliography related to Spanish colonial dances in the Philippines and the context that Antonia Mercé experienced during her stay in Manila in 1929.New York Public Library (New York, USA)It contains a wide range of materials, including letters, programs, press clippings, drawings of her dances by different artists, scores, and other documents.Museums and cultural institutionsInstitut Mémoires de l&rsquo;Édition Contemporaine, Abbaye d&rsquo;Ardenne (Saint-Germain-la-Blanche-Herbe, France)It conserves some letters by Antonia Mercé addressed to writers.Musée de l&rsquo;Opéra de Vichy (Vichy, France)This archive contains essential graphic and written sources related to Antonia Mercé’s performances at the Opéra, such as programs, posters and press clippings.Museo Mariemma (Íscar, Valladolid, Spain)This museum conserves the personal collection of the dancer Mariemma, who received the donation of some of the costumes and castanets of the dancer from her brother, and conserves some programs and written documents.Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (Madrid, Spain)The most important contemporary art museum in Spain, it contains graphic materials by painters who collaborated with Antonia Mercé, such as Carlos Sáenz de Tejada, some of which were recently incorporated from the painter’s private collection.Museo Nacional del Teatro (Almagro, Ciudad Real, Spain)The state museum of theatre conserves different art works linked to Antonia Mercé, such as sketches and costumes, as well as written documents, photographs and other objects such as castanets and one of the plaster copies of her mortuary mask.Museo Néstor (Las Palmas de Gran Canarias, Spain)This museum conserves the private collection of painter Nestor Martínez de la Torre, one of the main artists who collaborated with Antonia Mercé. It contains a wide variety of materials, such as costume and set designs, programs, letters, etc., and specifically, the book <em>Néstor y el mundo del teatro</em> (1995) by Pedro Juan Almeida Cabrera, the first publication dedicated to Néstor’s work on stage.Residencia de Estudiantes (Madrid, Spain)This collection is focused on the so-called Spanish Silver Age, that is to say, the flourishing culture of the first third of the 20th century. It comprises several written sources, such as manuscripts, letters, musical scores, recordings, a wide bibliography, and the donated collection of photographs of Antonia Mercé that belonged to the former dancer and gallerist Elvira González.<br>
Among the large number of primary sources conserved in these institutions, programs, posters, press clippings and correspondence were essential as they provided the vital space-time information. Furthermore, it was necessary to contrast the data with other sources such as photographs, costume and set designs, wardrobe and video recordings. Other studies about Antonia Mercé and her Ballets Espagnols were equally important.</p>
<p>At the same time, and in line with the <em>gesamtkunstwerk</em> and the theoretical framework of the period, the project members considered it a priority to equate the importance of authorship in the different disciplines involved in Spanish dance work, and to highlight not only those responsible for choreography and music, as so often happens, but also to focus on the role of set and costume design — framed as a whole phenomenon of the time<a class="footnote-ref" href="#murgacastro2012"> [murgacastro2012] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#murgacastro2017b"> [murgacastro2017b] </a>— , to reveal the authorship of the plays<a class="footnote-ref" href="#coellohernandez2019"> [coellohernandez2019] </a>;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#coellohernandez2020a"> [coellohernandez2020a] </a>and to vindicate the contributions of the performers.</p>
<p>Likewise, given the enormous number of performances that Antonia Mercé gave both with the Ballets Espagnols and in individual recitals, it was necessary to clarify the layout of her itineraries, separating both types of programmes, but offering an overall reading that would facilitate the comprehension the context of the collective and the individual pieces — both the newly created solos and those numbers taken from the ballets that ended up working better as solo performances by the choreographer<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gomez2022"> [gomez2022] </a>.</p>
<h2 id="33-web-implementation-webmapping-and-wms-services">3.3. Web implementation: webmapping and WMS services</h2>
<p>The atomisation of the information collected allows it to be used in many ways, including analysis or visualisation. The development of amade-to-measureweb map<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> such as the one made for this project is a valuable tool as it offers an interactive interface to access all information on the project, thanks to the geographical nature of the central element of the model: the programmes. In this sense, it adds to the traditional thematic maps, which provide a concise and elegant representation of the data that led them to be a common resource for the illustration of scientific articles and books<a class="footnote-ref" href="#delbosquegonzalez2012"> [delbosquegonzalez2012] </a>.</p>
<p>The logic followed from the data model considers that the succession of programmes ordered by date generates a line that describes what could be called atour.Lines have been generated by linking the performances of the Ballets Espagnols and Antonia Mercé for each of the years considered in the project: 1927, 1928 and 1929. The points of each theatre allow access to the rest of the information collected by the research group: performances, performers, authors of the works and elements. In addition, there is also the possibility of filtering all the content shown according to the start and end dates of the performances, using a time bar.</p>

<h2 id="4-conclusions">4. Conclusions</h2>
<p>In short, the analysed case study illustrates how the methods employed by Digital Humanities, and specifically the Spatial Humanities, make it possible to extend and amplify the interpretative level of many different historical sources scattered in numerous locations. The consultation of an enormous amount of documentation, distributed among institutions in different countries, has been complemented, ordered and arranged for the reconstruction of the trajectories of the Ballets Espagnols de Antonia Mercé La Argentina, temporarily based in Paris in interwar Europe. The impact of this project can be seen especially in the interactive visualisation, the delimitation of the monthly time periods of the company&rsquo;s activities over the two years and the ability to distinguish between Antonia Mercé&rsquo;s individual recitals and the performances of the whole company. Moreover, the project has provided the opportunity to assess each performance in the context of the critical response and artistic production.</p>
<p>In spatial terms, the georeferenced assessment of the dancer&rsquo;s performances in different theatres in the same city is particularly interesting, as it provides a better idea of the prestige that her shows were acquiring over time. The exact location of each performance also makes it possible to understand the type of audience that might attend the shows, depending on the district where the theatre was located, the distance from the city centre and the different categories of venues. Therefore, in the early days, the circuits in which the Ballets Espagnols were shown were somewhat peripheral — it is worth noting their world premiere in the German city of Krefeld. Their first steps were taken in Germany and Italy, but it was not until later, when the performers were more experienced on stage and familiar with a more refined repertoire, that the Ballets Espagnols premiered in Paris.</p>
<p>However, it is noticeable that even Antonia Mercé did not dance on the first-class stages, such as the Paris Opera, until a few months before her death in 1936, after several attempts to revive her frustrated project of the Ballets Espagnols. The seasonal itineraries through numerous European cities between 1927 and 1929 confirm that Antonia Mercé&rsquo;s company had not yet achieved the prestige of other, more established international dance groups, who enjoyed a more constant and prolonged presence in leading cultural centres (Fig. 6). The Théâtre National de l&rsquo;Opéra Comique (Paris) and Town Hall (New York) stand out as key centres in the dancer&rsquo;s career (Fig. 7).</p>

<p>However, research into the period between 1929 and 1936 points to successive attempts to revive the company by touring other countries in America and Europe, including Spain. In this respect, it is also relevant to analyse the global dimension of the individual recitals of Antonia Mercé, who, in her tours outside Europe, set a precedent for the scope of Spanish dance in places such as Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines and the United States, with diverse connotations.</p>

<p>Another of the analysed issues was the internal development of the company, in particular its components. Although in-depth research into the composition of the corps de ballet of the Ballets Espagnols in its different seasons is still lacking, this qualitative approach yields some interesting indicators. Between 1927 and 1929, the group had a total of 91 dancers in its various performances, which varied each season. In 1927, there were 31, the following year 54 and the last season 43. Antonia Mercé starred in a total of 151 performances, accompanied mainly by the three most recurrent dancers: Irene Ibáñez (50 performances), Carmen Joselito (49 performances) and Carmen Juárez (46 performances). In a second group, other performers stand out, such as Mercedes Dalmau (39), Juan Relámpago (38), Otilio López (35), Lolita Mas (29), Blanca Minondo (28), Carmen Mora (27), and Pepita López (27). We must also point out the absolute prominence of Carmencita Pérez as piano accompanist (with 63 performances).</p>
<p>In short, the possibility of visualising all these trajectories reconstructed step by step on the interactive map motivates new interpretations to be made of exchanges in European circuits, in the relationship with the Americas, and in East-West relations. Besides it proposes renewed interpretations of the role of dance as a vehicle for the construction and dissemination of cultural identities. Looking at Spanish dance from a Digital Humanities point of view helps to obtain a broader and deeper understanding of historical heritage and strengthen the dialogues between the virtual and the physical, the permanent and the ephemeral, the past and the future. The case study of the Ballets Espagnols can open the door to new ways of understanding the role of dance in the mapping of identities, aesthetics and ideologies from transnational and transcultural perspectives in the early 20th century.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<p>The field of digital humanities defines itself by a capacity for interrogating and innovating the traditional humanities. More than a mere transference from material to analog to digital, this field claims to function as a “subversive force” with its own creations and challenges<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hayles2012"> [hayles2012] </a>. Distinguishing digital humanities as not better or worse, but different, from its predecessor, N. Katherine Hayles states that such “differences can leverage traditional assumptions so they become visible and hence available for rethinking” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#hayles2012"> [hayles2012] </a>. Yet, this very assertion demonstrates one of the field’s central challenges, for Hayles here replicates an age-old assumption that something must firstbecome visiblefor it then to beavailable for rethinking.Multiple digital humanities scholars have acknowledged the field’s difficulty in defying such visual hegemony or, stated otherwise, interrogating and innovating vision as itself historically dominant.</p>
<p>Observing that “the digital humanities is today overwhelmingly visual,” Sari Altschuler and David Weimer claim this imbalance to “have inadvertently exacerbated a tendency to privilege sight as the sense through which knowledge is accessible” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#altschuler2020"> [altschuler2020] </a>. Such privileging largely results from the Scientific Revolution and subsequent Age of Enlightenment. With the development of seeing and printing technologies in the 15th and 16th centuries, visual mapping and charting assumed central roles in understanding the world on small and large scales. In <em>Hypercities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities</em> , Todd Samuel Presner, David Shepard, Yoh Kawano note such mapping to have been critically involved in the establishment and expansion of European nation-states, including colonial conquest<a class="footnote-ref" href="#presner2014"> [presner2014] </a>. Yet while mapping never has been, and never will be, a neutral representation of knowledge, many scholars celebrate the shift to digital mapping as a potentially more multi-sensory and malleable practice.</p>
<p>According to Clancy Wilmott, digital mapping has upended “the assumption that ‘the map’ is a static representational object” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cooper2016"> [cooper2016] </a>. More than artifactual maps made with permanent ink and parchment,the mapnow commonly functions less as an object and more as a dynamic, interactive process. Such functionality is inevitably transformational, if not exactly subversive, prompting the skeptical attention of humanities and digital humanities scholars alike. In <em>Literary Mapping in the Digital Age</em> , David Cooper, Christopher Donaldson, and Patricia Murrieta-Flores emphasize the need to evaluate “how the process of digital mapping and map-making alters the way we perceive and engage with the geographies that surround us” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#cooper2016"> [cooper2016] </a>. Such evaluation interrogates what digital mapping reveals, conceals, and remains unable to convey, perhaps facilitating “new spatial practices and spatial imaginings.”</p>
<p>In this article, I engage debates on critical cartography with particular attention to how digital mapping influences humans’ understandings of landscape, as well as themselves. Specifically, I investigate the subversive potential of digital mapping the Sonoran Desert in the context of an ongoing U.S.-Mexico border crisis, where hegemonic practices of seeing, knowing, and surveilling continue to shore up colonization and its violent legacy. As U.S. border militarization implicates, and intentionally disappears, multitudes of humans and nonhumans each year, questions of mapping preoccupy government agencies, international corporations, on-the-ground activists, and interdisciplinary scholars alike. In what follows, I join multiple humanities and digital humanities scholars in thinking about the possibility of mapping the unmappable, including that which remains invisible by design. Additionally, I ask,How might such counter-mapping facilitate a rethinking of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, beyond anthropocentrism?</p>
<p>To address these questions, I first provide historical and theoretical background on the necessity, as well as difficulty, of mapping and counter-mapping this region. Next, I analyze two well-known examples of counter-mapping, namely Jason De León’s Undocumented Migration Project and Valeria Luiselli’s <em>Lost Children Archive</em> . After investigating the ways in which De León and Luiselli privilege visual and sonic counter-mapping, respectively, I model a more multi-sensory counter-mapping practice. Though this practice remains far from perfect, I argue that such digital counter-mapping crosses sight and sound in ways that challenge historical divisions among humans and nonhumans. Accordingly, it decenters humans as the sole, and most important, victims of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis.</p>
<h2 id="ii-mapping-and-counter-mapping">II. Mapping and Counter-mapping</h2>
<p>I focus on the Arizona-Sonora region of the U.S.-Mexico border: home to Apache, Hopi, Maricopa, Mayo, Pima, Navajo, Yaqui, Hohokam, and Tohono O’odham peoples, as well as exceptionally biodiverse mountain regions known as sky islands.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Throughout the arrival of Spanish missionaries in the early 18th century, the Mexican-American War (1846-47), the Gadsden Purchase (1854), and the Apache Wars (1849-1924), indigenous and colonial settler populations violently negotiated and renegotiated control of these borderlands. After the annexation of U.S. territories including Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California from Mexico in the mid-1800s, migration northward was incentivized or illegalized depending on the U.S.’ political and economic need.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Still, enforcement remained relatively lax until theBorder Patrol Strategic Plan of 1994 and Beyond,which heightened the militarization of the border through increasingly brutal uses of land and surveillance technology. Since its implementation, such policy has resulted in 7,000 to 8,000 migrants dying while crossing Southern Arizona<a class="footnote-ref" href="#colibri2020"> [colibri2020] </a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> . By design, many of these deaths remain unidentifiable, if not altogether invisible. In turn, mapping practices in this area now indicate not just who wins the war and owns the land, but what life remains in this undeclared killing zone.</p>
<p>Currently, the only map on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website is that of itsBorder Wall System,depicted in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Looking at this digital ArcGIS map with a thick, but noticeably partial, line along the U.S.-Mexico border, viewers can click on highlighted parts of the line for more information about ongoing wall construction and associated photos<a class="footnote-ref" href="#customs2020"> [customs2020] </a>. However, those interested in other forms ofborder securityneed to look elsewhere for data on drone technology, scope stations, and ArcGIS live monitoring software. Knowledge of this largely invisible surveillance system exposes border wall-building as mere spectacle, for DHS policy is not designed to prevent migration per se, but rather to ensure its profitability. Instead of stopping migrants from crossing at all, for example, Prevention Through Deterrence intentionally pushes migrants out into the remote and dangerous desert, where they are more likely to die or, alternatively, to be apprehended, detained, and eventually deported. On its website, however, DHS misrepresents itself as benign, wall-building protector, and the Sonoran Desert as brutal murderer.</p>
<p>Given the high stakes of mapping in this and other areas of conflict, scholars and activists have employed varied practices of counter-mapping. Coined by sociologist Nancy Peluso, the termcounter-mappingrefers to processes in which communities appropriate and repurpose institutional techniques of map-making in order to create alternatives to hegemonic representations<a class="footnote-ref" href="#peluso1995"> [peluso1995] </a>. Anthropologist Jason De León, who has studied migration and violence in Southern Arizona since 2009, draws on fellow migration scholar Martina Tazzioli’s elaboration of counter-mapping as having two specific purposes of 1) making visible the effects of authority and 2) challenging the very possibility of mapping these effects<a class="footnote-ref" href="#tazzioli2015"> [tazzioli2015] </a>. This definition is notable for exhibiting a tension similar to that of digital humanities insofar as it simultaneously relies on and resistsmaking visibleas a principal source of knowledge.</p>
<p>Like Hayles, Tazzioli here implies that she intends to rethink the very concepts to which she appeals, including visibility and mapping. Noting the humanities and digital humanities’ dominant reliance on visual and textual methods, multiple scholars have recently turned to sound and listening as part of a heretofore neglected epistemology. For example, Mary Caton Lingold, Darren Mueller, and Whitney Trettien, editors of <em>Digital Sound Studies</em> , wonder what forms of knowledge and embodied experience are going unheard in the digital turn<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lingold2018"> [lingold2018] </a>. Turning to sound as an under-utilized mode of study within digital humanities, this collection challenges not just the hierarchization of senses, but also their very separation. Since this separation emerged over time, as part of Enlightenment thinking, sound studies scholars such as Jonathan Sterne and Michael J. Kramer claim we can use theflexible modularityof digital data to both understand and reverse this history<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lingold2018"> [lingold2018] </a>.</p>
<p>As I will elaborate in my study of counter-mapping the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, undoing this separation of senses can also challenge the historical division of nation-states and species. For while much discussion of counter-mapping emphasizes the visualization of space, and even De León claims his work to “foster alternative forms of understanding, visualizing, and producing <em>space</em> ,” I read his work as especially important for the ways in which it sets up a rethinking of the Sonoran Desert as a space of invisible and indiscriminate violence. In <em>Lost Children Archive</em> , a novel that also studies migration and disappearance in Southern Arizona, Valeria Luiselli furthers such rethinking by privileging sound as a mode of knowledge with counter-mapping capabilities. Reading these scholars’ work together exposes the stakes of counter-mapping to be not simply a rethinking of sight and sound as they relate to space, but also as they relate to the humans <em>and</em> nonhumans traversing such space. In other words, the stakes are ways of witnessing the U.S.-Mexico border crisis that decenter visuality and anthropocentrism simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="iii-visual-counter-mapping">III. Visual Counter-mapping</h2>
<p>The similarities between Jason De León’s <em>The Land of Open Graves</em> (2015), his first book about the Undocumented Migration Project, and Valeria Luiselli’s <em>Lost Children Archive</em> (2019) become more obvious upon considering the latter’s translated title, <em>El Desierto Sonoro</em> (2020).<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Both books are about the Arizona desert, and principally the Sonoran Desert, which is a biodiverse region covering large parts of the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico. More specifically, these books are about the many thousands of migrants that have attempted to cross this dangerous landscape, especially since the Department of Homeland Security’s implementation of itsPrevention Through Deterrencepolicy, part of the aforementioned “Border Patrol Strategic Plan of 1994 and Beyond.” Entailing heightened militarization and surveillance in urban sections of the border such as San Diego, California and Nogales, Arizona, this policy intentionally pushes traveling migrants into rural areas that increase their chances of turning themselves in, getting lost, or dying. Since the early 2000s, the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner has reported doing upwards of 150 autopsies on undocumented border corpses annually<a class="footnote-ref" href="#continued2013"> [continued2013] </a>. Furthermore, Dr. Gregory Hess, Pima County’s current Chief Medical Examiner, estimates that these self-disclosed numbers likely represent just 1/3 of actual migrant deaths in this area<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hess2019"> [hess2019] </a>.</p>
<p>As De León’s title indicates, this terrain is truly a land of open graves. Yet, the desert’s intense heat, strong wind, and flash floods quickly decompose and disperse migrant bodies, making finding and identifying them still difficult. De León, both an archaeologist and anthropologist by training, started the<a href="https://www.undocumentedmigrationproject.org/">Undocumented Migration Project</a>in 2009 in order to better understand the causes, as well as physical experiences, of undocumented border crossing<a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2015"> [deleon2015] </a>. Using ethnographic, archaeological, forensic, and visual anthropological methods to collect evidence of such crossing, De León distinguishes his interdisciplinary work as takingsideways glancesthat “foster new ways of thinking about border crossings and the routinized pain and suffering that accompany them” (<a href="#deleon2015">17</a>). These sideways glances, a concept originally proposed by Slavoj Žižek in <em>Violence: Six Sideways Reflections</em> , entail zooming out beyond a mere focus on the human subjects of violence in order to think more broadly and critically about the structural causes of such violence<a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2015"> [deleon2015] </a>. For De León, this means witnessing what remains otherwise overlooked, including the socioeconomic factors that cause migrants to leave their homelands, as well as those that have made their journey increasingly dangerous.</p>
<p>In <em>The Land of Open Graves</em> , such witnessing involves both narrating and counter-mapping in ways that put pressure on hegemonic forms of documentation, principally those of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but sometimes also those of fellow human rights activists. Acknowledging the graphic nature of his work, for example, De León recounts instances in which critics have claimed his photos of decayed migrant corpses to rob their subjects of human dignity. His refusal to instead make migrant bodies visible as whole and uninjured is striking for its refusal to rehumanize such victims, as many human rights archives and organizations profess to do.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> In his words, “The deaths that migrants experience in the Sonoran Desert are <em>anything</em> but dignified. <em>That</em> is the point” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2015"> [deleon2015] </a>. For De León, such dehumanization, both in life and in death, is the precise point of policies including Prevention Through Deterrence. Identifying such decomposition as a form of structural, postmortem violence, he elaborates that the seemingnaturalprocesses of dying and decaying in the desert are actually “political facts representative of the value placed on the lives and deaths of undocumented people” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2015"> [deleon2015] </a>.</p>
<p>These claims are noteworthy for their simultaneous reliance upon and rejection of Enlightenment-based practices of seeing, knowing, and valorizing the human. For while De León does privilege visual and material evidence, he also stubbornly casts his glance askew of the very subjectivity, or indeed humanity, associated with such epistemology. This move corresponds with Elizabeth Anker’s critique of how Enlightenment-based notions of the human body and mind still inform dominant notions of humanitarianism and human rights activism. As she observes, these discourses predicate human dignity on corporeal integrity; for an individual to be a human worthy of rights, they must first have a body that is “whole, autonomous, and self-enclosed” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#anker2012"> [anker2012] </a>. This is because, according to Enlightenment-based liberalism, only this type of body meets related ideals, such as reason, conscience, and freedom. Yet Anker points out that this idealized human body and subject is paradoxicallydecorporealized,for it negates core dimensions of embodied experience, includingvulnerabilityanddecay<a class="footnote-ref" href="#anker2012"> [anker2012] </a>.</p>
<p>When De León foregrounds migrants’ partially decayed corpses as “ <em>anything</em> but dignified,” he likewise acknowledges and critiques hegemonic standards of human rights subjectivity. Making visible a commonly overlooked reality, his photos are graphic reminders of the human body’s limits: the very limits that leave it susceptible to both violence <em>and</em> ignorance. If bodies are not whole, they also cannot see whole pictures, or know whole stories. Yet, denying these limits in the name of human dignity is one way humans separate themselves as physically and mentally superior to other animals<a class="footnote-ref" href="#anker2012"> [anker2012] </a>. In this sense, De León’s images challenge visuality and anthropocentrism simultaneously, serving his noted interest in “troubling human-nonhuman binaries” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2015"> [deleon2015] </a>. Furthermore, they help show howstructural agencyboth commits and conceals violence in the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.</p>
<p>According to De León’s counter-mapping research with the Undocumented Migration Project, such structural agency involves the dehumanization of humans, as well as the humanization, ordenaturalization,of nonhumans such as the Arizona desert. Prevention Through Deterrence, which is just one policy, for example, involves human, technological, geographical, animal, mineral, and meteorological actants. Drawing on Michel Callon and John Law’s theory ofhybrid collectif,which identifies agency as a property that emerges from the interaction of various heterogeneous actants, De León refers to this combination of human and nonhuman agents involved in the U.S.-Mexico border crisis as theSonoran Desert hybrid collectif.To fully account for this collectif, De León stresses the need to abandon dualist thinking, including that which relies on simplistic human-nonhuman binaries. On one hand, he wants to expose how the U.S. Department of Homeland Security “can draw on the agency of animals and other nonhumans to do its dirty work while simultaneously absolving itself of any blame connected to migrant injuries or loss of life” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2015"> [deleon2015] </a>. Yet, on the other hand, he is careful of falling back into an anthropocentrism that myopically frames humans as the only perpetrators, as well as victims, involved in this complex crime scene.</p>
<p>In his counter-mapping work, De León often draws on data from the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants map, which is represented here in Figure 2 and is the result of an ongoing partnership between the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner and Humane Borders, Inc.</p>

</figure>
<p>A counter-map in its own right, this map challenges hegemonic representations of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis by repurposing geographic information system (GIS) software similar to that which DHS uses in conjunction with remote sensors, lookout towers, and agent-carried GPS units<a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2016"> [deleon2016] </a>.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> For DHS, these technologies provide immediate information on suspected migrant activity in remote areas that appear otherwise unsurveilled, or simplynatural<a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2016"> [deleon2016] </a>. In contrast, the Deceased Migrants map implements GIS software with the mission of raising awareness about the entirely unnatural quantity of migrant deaths in the Arizona desert and, when possible, also identifying the deceased so that remains may be returned to families. Accordingly, the map charts the locations of found corpses, as well as related information such as postmortem interval, body condition, cause of death and — if identifiable — name, sex, and age<a class="footnote-ref" href="#arizonaopengis"> [arizonaopengis] </a>. A dynamic digital map with numerous search functions, it also allows searches by migrant name, land corridor, and year of death.</p>
<p>As a viewer who repurposes these GIS tools and information once more, De León foregrounds not only human victims’ suffering, but also the hybrid collectif implicated in it. In “Scales of Suffering in the US-Mexico Borderlands,” an article published after <em>The Land of Open Graves</em> and with anthropologist co-authors Cameron Gokee and Haeden Stewart, De León plots migrant deaths and belongings against multiple representations of the Sonoran Desert, specifically the Nogales-Sasabe corridor. The Undocumented Migration Project’s expansive archive of discarded objects includes intimate items such as bibles, love letters, and photos, as well as practical items such as backpacks, water bottles, and shoes. Here, De León specifically plots aid-related artifacts against geography models, showing how the use of bandages, anti-infectives, and analgesics corresponds to changing contours of the terrain. Figure 3 depicts a map of aid-related artifacts and associated land covers documented in the Nogales-Sasabe corridor by the Undocumented Migration Project from 2009-2013<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gokee2020"> [gokee2020] </a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Especially in cases where migrant corpses have decomposed to the point of complete destruction, discarded belongings function as the only clues to one’s demise out in the remote desert. Therefore, De León and his co-authors view thesescales of analysisas able “to let the suffering of migrants ‘speak’ in different ways” : ways that expose humans’ victimization and the desert’s weaponization simultaneously<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gokee2020"> [gokee2020] </a>.</p>
<p>When counter-mapping, De León is forthright about the “seemingly paradoxical attempt to use spatial data and spatial analysis to critique and undermine spatial data and spatial analysis” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2016"> [deleon2016] </a>. While DHS employs private mapping and analytics software, such as Esri’s ArcGIS, De León draws from the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants map, which uses open source software to make data readily available. Yet, this information on migrants’ deaths could simultaneously serve as valuable data on the efficacy of border enforcement, and how to strengthen it. Given this possibility, De León elsewhere notes a resistance to publishing such data and touches on a central debate in digital humanities about the possibility of dismantling the master’s house with the master’s tools<a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2016"> [deleon2016] </a>. Analyzing the risks of using GIS software that produces data, as well as money, for ethically dubious companies, Safiya Noble advises the public to stay vigilant of how such software further entrenches them in the very systems they may be critiquing<a class="footnote-ref" href="#noble2011"> [noble2011] </a>. Since Noble also notes how these same GIS technologies often help improve communities, she urges critical yet creative applications. Yet, I contend that part of De León’s conundrum is his maps’ reliance on not just the same GIS tools, but also the same visual media and human categories, that are readily recognizable to DHS.</p>
<p>For this reason, I am most interested in where and how De León also repurposes the master’s tools beyond the point of easy recognition. Though he views his counter-maps as able to let the suffering of migrantsspeak,he claims “they also contain their own silences and elisions” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gokee2020"> [gokee2020] </a>. Here, De León notably switches from framing his work as predominantly visual to also vocal in order to point out how it is only partially revelatory. Yet, he elaborates on his maps’ incapacity to represent everything in every way as “critical to countering the scalar projects, including maps, that obscure decades of migrant suffering at the hands of PTD [Prevention Through Deterrence] policies along the US- Mexico border” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#gokee2020"> [gokee2020] </a>. In this sense, such silences are part of his maps’ functionality, not flaws. In fact, they alsospeak,as they further expose the ways in which migrants have been intentionally disappeared, both in life and death.</p>
<p>At the same time, such silences remain absolute insofar as they represent absence: the absence of a body, testimony, identifiable human subject. Throughout the humanities and digital humanities, multiple scholars continue to grapple with how to account for such absence, which is endemic to archives about systemic violence and erasure. Thinking specifically about the archive of American slavery, Lauren Klein notes how the silences of slaves expose atruearchive thatencompasses impossibility,including the impossibility of knowing<a class="footnote-ref" href="#klein2013"> [klein2013] </a>. Against Enlightenment-based epistemological biases that elevate “what is observable to the status of fact,” Klein values the archive as a tool for exposing the limits of our knowledge, limits that even digital methods such as data visualization fail to surpass<a class="footnote-ref" href="#klein2013"> [klein2013] </a>. In failing, however, they force us to think about other ways of seeing and knowing, such as speaking and listening. While De León’s work briefly mentions these possibilities, I now turn to Valeria Luiselli’s <em>Lost Children Archive</em> as a counter-mapping model that instead privileges the auditory. Such an approach, I argue, enables her to further challenge epistemological biases and human/nonhuman binaries.</p>
<h2 id="iv-sonic-counter-mapping">IV. Sonic Counter-mapping</h2>
<p>Contrary to De León’s appeal to visual and material evidence in the form of migrant bodies and their belongings, Luiselli’s <em>Lost Children Archive</em> centralizes a lack of such evidence. Or, rather, the uncertainty of all evidence. The mother-protagonist, a radio journalist by profession, is never quite sure of what she sees or hears, making her story largely about the impossibility of narration, as well as traditional mapping. At first, she helps record child migrants’ oral testimonies in the New York immigration court, where she volunteers as a translator<a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. But when her husband insists on going westward to record auditory echoes of the Apache, who were disappeared in the Sonoran Desert long before the current U.S.-Mexico border crisis, she begins adjusting her own work to be able to accompany him. As she proceeds to research,slowly build an archive,and extend her focus on the child refugee crisis tothe southern borderlands,the book becomes about her process of trying to connect multiple ideas, images, voices, and lack thereof into a new project.</p>
<p>Explaining the archival nature of this novel, Luiselli distinguishes its “textual, musical, visual, and audio-visual” references as central “voices in the conversation that the book sustains with the past” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. In addition to history, <em>Lost Children Archive</em> engages the fields of law, anthropology, cartography, and acoustics, among others. As a result, one can read Luiselli’s book as a specific type of interdisciplinary archive: a sound map. Encouraging interdisciplinarity and experimentation within archival studies, Marlene Marnoff claims thatthinking through makingis key to finding new ways ofinterrogating archival silence<a class="footnote-ref" href="#foscarini2016"> [foscarini2016] </a>. In <em>Lost Children Archive,</em> the mother-protagonist specifically practices a thinking through listening and mapping, as she continually tries to chart the sounds and spaces that both envelop and elude her. Lacking a visual and digital interface, such counter-mapping requires readers to likewise navigate the Sonoran Desert through her ears, a methodology that often conflates present and absent, as well as human and nonhuman, subjects.</p>
<p>While <em>Lost Children Archive</em> does publish images of multiple visual, and in this sense hegemonic, maps, it also consistently calls such maps into question. For example, the mother-protagonist’s archive includes a version of the very Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants map that De León draws upon. Depicted in Figure 4, this particular version charts migrant deaths against the Sonoran Desert, as well as the distance they likely had walked each day after crossing the border, in order to warn potential border crossers of the perilous journey.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As aforementioned, this map functions as a counter-map insofar as it charts deaths that have been both caused, and erased, by policies such as Prevention Through Deterrence. Yet, Luiselli cues a reading of this map as also inevitably exclusionary and, in this sense, complicit with invisibility. Noting how maps can “make visible what is usually unseen,” the mother-protagonist nevertheless concludes that “To map is to include as much as to exclude” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. More than associate excluded remains with invisibility, however, she connects them specifically to sound. A section of the book titled “Undocumented,” for example, begins with the epigraph, “An exile feels that the state of exile is a constant, special sensitivity to sound” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. In the context of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis,undocumentedthus takes on multiple meanings, including unmapped, unseen, and yet still potentially audible.</p>
<p>Auditory studies of the U.S.-Mexico border are far less abundant than visual ones, yet multiple artists, activists, and scholars have likewise observed this area’s sonic dimensions to be uniquely boundless. In an analysis of how composer Guillermo Galindo turns objects found along the U.S.-Mexico border, including the border wall itself, into musical instruments, culture and music scholar Josh Kun observes sound to be more permeable than sight. Noting how we can readily hear the border’s other side, even without full vision, Kun states, “What walls and fences are meant to divide, sounds can move through and resonate across. What looks monumental to the eye sounds unmonumental to the ear. There are no borders for vibrations” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#misrach2016"> [misrach2016] </a>. Here, Kun touches on the material <em>and</em> immaterial nature of sound, for such vibrations only become audible, even amplified, through the very objects they contact. This makes containing sound very difficult, as even ostensible silence often involves resonant vibrations. In auditory encounter, something usually escapes, perceived or unperceived. Given this unmonumental medium and sense’s historic subordination to sight as form of knowledge, however, such sound often fails to adequately capture human ears, let alone imaginations.</p>
<p>For this reason, multiple humanities and digital humanities scholars frame listening as an acquired, not default, sense. As Jonathan Sterne explains, listening is a technique that “connotes practice, virtuosity, and the possibility of failure and accident […] It is a learned skill” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#sterne2003"> [sterne2003] </a>. For the mother-protagonist in <em>Lost Children Archive</em> , listening evolves from simply hearing sound, namely that of migrants’ oral testimonies, to sonically counter-mapping a landscape of unbounded phenomena. During a moment of revelation, she realizes that both her and her husband’s research projects entailchasing ghosts and echoes<a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. Her husband’s ghosts and echoes are those of the last Apache leaders, including Chief Cochise, Geronimo, and the Chiricahuas. As the final indigenous Americans to surrender to settler-colonists and their Indian Removal Act, which forced remaining tribes onto federal reservations, these people were exiled from their own homeland just like many migrant refugees and deportees. The mother-protagonist draws this parallel most closely as she watches a plane of child refugees head back to their ostensible homeland, yet only by departing from the land of their probable ancestors, as well as current family (<a href="#luiselli2019a">191</a>). Because migrant and indigenous populations have been effectively disappeared, one throughremovaland another throughdeportation,both the mother-protagonist and her husband necessarily take a spectral approach to sound.</p>
<p>According to Ana María Ochoa Gautier, thespectrality of soundrefers to that which remains inaudible, at least to humans, as “excesses of the acoustic” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#steingo2019"> [steingo2019] </a>. Another sense in which sound is boundless, for example, involves the fact that it reverberates well beyond human hearing, including in acoustic <em>and</em> ultrasonic forms. If a bat chirps or cactus falls in the Sonoran Desert and no human hears it, it still does make a sound. Furthermore, that sound may interact with and turn into other sounds, commonly called echoes. In <em>Lost Children Archive</em> , both the husband and wife appeal to echoes as a trope for spectral listening to that which they both can and cannot hear. However, only the wife practices such listening as a dynamic and disorienting mode of counter-mapping. For her, such counter-mapping entails contextualizing sounds, as well as related ideas, against hegemonic maps of time, space, and subjects as singular and absolute.</p>
<p>According to the wife, her husband claims his project to be aninventory of echoes<a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. Yet, he never elaborates more than that, since his understanding of sound as self-evident affords him a rather literal definition of echoes. Anacoustemologisttrained insoundscaping,the husband follows the work of R. Murray Schafer and shares his interest in acoustic ecology as “the study of sounds in relationship to life and society” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#schafer1977"> [schafer1977] </a>. For Schafer, as well as <em>Lost Children Archive</em> ’s husband, the bulk of this study entails recording, naming, and cataloging sounds in an effort to capture, and thereby understand, “the general acoustic environment of a society” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#schafer1977"> [schafer1977] </a>. While most sound scholars recognize Schafer as pivotal in establishing sound as another way of knowing, they also criticize his presumptuous appeal tothe general,or universal, as neglectful of sound’s multivalent, and highly contextual, meanings<a class="footnote-ref" href="#novak2015"> [novak2015] </a>.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Similarly, the wife assesses her husband’s work as crudely matter-of-fact. For him, bird chirps, arroyo babbles, snake rattles, wind gusts, etc. heard in the present are, inevitably and indubitably, reverberations of sound waves from foregone times and peoples. Given the mother-protagonist’s attention to uncertainty and exclusion, however, she interprets his inventory of echoes as “ <em>trying</em> to capture their [the Apaches’] past presence in the world, and making it audible, despite their current absence” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>.</p>
<p>Instead of presuming presence, she is inclined to chart and interrogate it. Thinking of her husband’s inventory as a form of sound-mapping, therefore, she imagines that each echo temporarily “illuminate[s] an area of a map, a soundscape, in which Geronimo once was” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. Here, the wife crosses sight and sound in conceptualizing an illuminative echo, one that appears and disappears simultaneously. Using the spectrality of sound to trace the spectrality of removed populations makes sense to this cartographer, especially as she refuses to organize her own recorded material into a “clean narrative sequence” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. As she states, “We haven’t understood how space and time exist now, how we really experience them” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. In her evaluation, archivists such as her husband often fail to acknowledge the way all hearing, including all recording, is contextual: that is, it takes place in a particular time and space, neither of which are entirely singular or absolute. Situating all recording as a type of echo, Mark M. Smith similarly emphasizes the need to think of both as simultaneously historical and ahistorical. Rather than capture sounds from the past exactly as they were, recordings and echoes reproduce sounds from the past in the present, inevitably altering them<a class="footnote-ref" href="#novak2015"> [novak2015] </a>. For the wife in <em>Lost Children Archive</em> , this means that sounds, as well as the times and spaces in which they reverberate, take on multiple, ever-changing meanings. They are dynamic and, for this very reason, also disorienting.</p>
<p>As such, her mode of listening closely corresponds with Nicole Brittingham Furlonge’saural literacy,which she claims to entail “listening as an artistic, civic, and interpretive practice that emerges from a place of wonder, curiosity, and <em>not knowing</em> ” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#furlonge2018"> [furlonge2018] </a>. Drawing from a multimedia archive of work by black authors and artists, Furlonge examines how literary texts can shift reading from a strictly visual practice to one thatdemands an aural sensory engagementin which readersthink with their earsabout historical constructions of racial difference.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Although, or perhaps <em>because</em> , literary texts are technically silent, they can guide readers in hearing and thinking about sound in innovative ways, including as anepistemic sitefor questioning historical hierarchies and identities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#furlonge2018"> [furlonge2018] </a>. Acknowledging the close connection between <em>how</em> we know and <em>who</em> we understand humans to be, or not be, <em>Lost Children Archive</em> ’s mother-protagonist likewise listens from a position of inquiry. Instead of distinguishing and labeling sounds, for example, she hears them together as a collective victim of history, or what she calls “beautiful things falling apart” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>.</p>
<p>Attune to the very lack of visual and material evidence concerning migrants, the mother-protagonist instead listens for additional unknowns, mostly in the form of other historical instances of disappearance. Hearing spectral sounds of the Apache, missing border crossers, and surrounding desert landscape all at once, she observes “the chaos of history repeated, over and over, reenacted, reinterpreted, the world, its fucked-up heart palpitating underneath us [&hellip;] And in the middle of it all, tribes, families, people, all beautiful things falling apart, debris, dust, erasure” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. This description is highly reminiscent of philosopher Walter Benjamin’s “Angel of History,” which recognizes the past, present, and future asone single catastrophein constant risk of oblivion, especially under the pressure of “what we call progress” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#benjamin2007"> [benjamin2007] </a>. Like this angel, and more critically than her husband, Luiselli’s mother-protagonist thus hears bird chirps, arroyo babbles, snake rattles, wind gusts, etc. asreenactmentsandreinterpretationsof loss: the loss, yes, of child migrants but also the indigenous populations that preceded them and likewise endangered wildlife that accompany them. Elsewhere elaborating that “perhaps my children’s voices were like those bird songs that my husband helped Steven Feld record once, which function as echoes of people who have passed away,” she effectively collapses human-nonhuman binaries<a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. Yet, she maintains her uncertainty, as well as curiosity, through her insistent use ofperhaps.In doing so, she shows the practice ofaural literacy,or interdisciplinary listening without knowing, to function as a viable mode of counter-mapping against categorical understandings of time, space, and subject.</p>
<h2 id="iv-digital-humanities-counter-mapping-a-case-study">IV. Digital Humanities Counter-mapping: A Case Study</h2>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Thus far, I have examined a variety of visual, sonic, textual, and digital counter-maps. While De León and Luiselli make use of the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants map, which plots migrant deaths against the Sonoran Desert in order to expose the violence that policies such as Prevention Through Deterrence attempt to conceal, neither of them replicate this map’s digital interface or related humanitarian maneuvers. Rather than try to restore migrant victims’ visibility and voice, either in life or death, De León and Luiselli take more reflexive approaches to witnessing. Questioning their own use of sight and sound while consulting visual, material, and sonic evidence, these scholars practicesidewaysseeing and spectral listening, both of which serve to witness the complexity of this U.S.-Mexico border crisis. Such complexity, as De León and Luiselli illustrate, is largely due to the involvement of human and nonhuman, as well as present and absent, agents. Since this border violence also implicates settler colonialism and imperialism, as well as the hegemony of visuality and human rights politics, it requires multiple, novel ways of knowing, including of mapping.</p>
<p>Accordingly, De León and Luiselli counter-map this crisis in ways that decenter the human, both as sensate being and liberal human rights subject. Building off of the counter-mapping possibilities evident in De León and Luiselli’s work, I now tap into the “subversive force” of digital humanities as a tool forrethinkingtraditional assumptions and practices, including those of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and human rights activism alike<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hayles2012"> [hayles2012] </a>. In particular, I remain curious about how multi-sensory counter-mapping helps readers and listeners further disorient themselves and, in the process, also the Sonoran Desert as a land that has been so forcefully oriented around the human, both as aggressor and as victim. Rather than centralize the human in witnessing the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, is it possible to listen from the perspectives of the many nonhuman agents involved, including those of dirt, animal, and wind? In other words, is it possible to hear what the desert hears?</p>
<p>Informed by Luiselli and De León, as well as other interdisciplinary cartographers and my own fieldwork in Southern Arizona, I have initiated a pilot project for counter-mapping the U.S.-Mexico border crisis as both a humanitarian crisis and a crisis of humanitarianism, or the centering and privileging of human victimhood. To be clear, my project is far from the first digital counter-mapping project about this crisis. Yet, many of these projects are principally visual and anthropocentric in nature. In addition to the aforementioned Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants map, <em>Torn Apart / Separados</em> is a scholar-activist intervention that has circulated widely since 2018. A response to the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance family separation policy, <em>Torn Apart / Separados</em> includes digital maps about ICE facilities, political funding, and deportations, as well as allied organizations for migrants. The <em>Torn Apart / Separados</em> team claims this work “peels back layers of culpability behind the humanitarian crisis of 2018” and exposes otherwise overlooked agents in the border crisis, such as the amount of ICE contracts awarded per congressional district. These cartographers also note the inevitablyimpreciseandcontingentnature of data visualizations, including maps, but do not detail their exclusions<a class="footnote-ref" href="#tornapart2018"> [tornapart2018] </a>.</p>
<p>Though humanitarian maps about the U.S.-Mexico border crisis tend to exclude data on nonhuman victims, land and wildlife studies of this region do often make some mention of disappeared migrants. In a recent joint press release from the Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, and Sky Island Alliance, Tucson-based environmental activists critique border militarization as detrimental to all local communities, including transitory ones. Protesting border wall construction for further impeding “the natural migrations of people and wildlife that are essential to healthy diversity,” these activists called for an immediate halt to such construction<a class="footnote-ref" href="#jordahl2020"> [jordahl2020] </a>.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Laiken Jordahl, Borderlands Campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, and Emily Burns, Program Director for Sky Island Alliance, are two such activists who regularly publish field research documenting life and loss along the border. For example, Jordahl has published multiple photos and videos of bulldozing and blasting through Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, which decimated endangered animal habitat and Tohono O’odham sacred sites for wall building. Focusing on the nearby Patagonia and Huachuca Mountains, Burns directs a binational Border Wildlife study catalogs species in the area through clandestine cameras.</p>
<p>While much research and activism along the border is multi-sensory insofar as it utilizes sight and sound, as well as other senses, to document ongoing violence and resistance, I contend that crossing senses can further decenter the human in this border crisis. In “A sensory approach for multispecies anthropology,” Natasha Fijn and Muhammad A. Kavesh defend the combination of sensory ethnography and multispecies anthropology as part of apost-humanist analysisthat is ecological, not anthropocentric, in nature<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fijn2021"> [fijn2021] </a>. Following fellow anthropologist Anna Tsing, they advocate a practice of observing and contemplating relationships among humans and nonhumans, including their shared precarity. Against human exceptionalism, this practice aims “to think beyond the boundary of the human, beyond ‘anthropos’ or ‘ethnos’” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#fijn2021"> [fijn2021] </a>. My counter-mapping project shares this aim, with the practical purpose of exposing the humanitarian crisis as the U.S.-Mexico border as also ecological in nature.</p>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>While multiple scholars have considered the possibility of witnessing beyond the human using an anthropological or philosophical approach, I here adopt a digital humanities approach, with a particular focus on pedagogy and practice.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> As such, my remaining concerns closely align with those of Steph Ceraso, author of <em>Sounding Composition: Multimodal Pedagogies for Embodied Listening</em> . In this book, Ceraso investigates how multimodal pedagogies and projects, including digital sound maps, facilitate “a reeducation of our senses — a bodily retraining that can help listeners learn to become more open to the connections among sensory modes, environments, and materials” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ceraso2018"> [ceraso2018] </a>. Like Furlonge and Luiselli, Ceraso advocates for an interdisciplinary, ormultimodal,practice of listening that involves thinking critically about the experience of sound, which she understands to be a “contextual […] sonic event” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#ceraso2018"> [ceraso2018] </a>. Whilemultimodalimplies that there are discrete modes of knowing and being, for example, Ceraso recognizes such separation of the senses to be historically and culturally learned.</p>
<p>In turn, her practices of multimodal listening and digital sound mapping involve attending to the ways senses interact with, and even subvert, each other in creating an embodied experience of place. More than simplylistenwith their ears, Ceraso’s students record the time of day and weather conditions of their audio recordings; look for visual and tactile proof of sonic vibrations; write textual descriptions of fieldwork experiences; and reflect on the limits of a digital interface such as Soundcities<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ceraso2018"> [ceraso2018] </a>. By crossing multiple senses while collecting data, students gradually recognize such sensory knowledge as both contextual and partial. At stake, therefore, in this “reeducation of our senses” is not just a newfound attunement to the complex connections among humans’ own sensory modes, but also among those modes and surroundingenvironmentsandmaterials.Such attunement, according to Ceraso, challenges visual approaches to knowing,ear-centricapproaches to listening, and, in my evaluation, also anthropocentric approaches to the humanities, including related humanitarian concerns<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ceraso2018"> [ceraso2018] </a>.</p>
<p>Informed by Ceraso, Luiselli, and De León, as well as the interdisciplinary scholars mentioned throughout this article and my own fieldwork in Southern Arizona, I have created a digital counter-map that decenters humans as the sole victims of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis. In this ArcGIS project, accessible<a href="https://arcg.is/41PDy">here</a>and represented in Figure 5, I combine sonic, visual, and literary evidence, sometimes together, at the same geotag, and sometimes apart. Such evidence, or proof of existence, includes descriptions of deceased migrants’body condition,audio recordings of animals, photos of desert landscapes, outlines of endangered species ranges and border walls, and excerpts from multiple texts, including De León’s <em>The Land of Open Graves</em> and Luiselli’s <em>Lost Children Archive</em> . As my practice of “Counter-mapping the U.S.-Mexico Border Crisis,” these map layers and survey points work against hegemonic practices of documentation, including those historically privileged by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, human rights activism, and the field of digital humanities alike. As previously explained, hegemonic practices separate and hierarchize species and senses, privileging humans and their vision simultaneously. In contrast, my practice crosses species and senses alike, showing all to be in relation, and also in danger.</p>

<p>I first recognized the need for this counter-mapping methodology in March of 2019, while co-leading a university trip to Southern Arizona called <em>Conocimiento</em> , orawareness.To expose students to the complexities of the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, this trip included meetings with various on-the-ground actors, including border residents, patrol agents, activists, and unauthorized day laborers. Depending on the actors’ differing interests, they referenced maps foregrounding border wall construction, military checkpoints, humanitarian aid stations, or, most commonly, the discovery of human remains. Throughout this trip, we saw at least three versions of Humane Borders’ “Map of Migrant Mortality,” which De León and Luiselli both reference in their work. Because my students had not read these authors’ depictions of the Sonoran Desert hybrid collectif, I feared that their perception of this landscape would be reduced to the hostile, even criminal, terrain that policies like Prevention Through Deterrence situate it as. It was during this trip, therefore, that I began brainstorming ways to map this landscape differently.</p>
<p>Like Ceraso, I wanted to put my students into a collaborative, even conversational, interaction with their surroundings. What did they hear as they took photos of Normandy-style vehicle barriers, Cottonwood trees, and a horizon often dotted with at least one memorial cross? How might this hearing change if they simultaneously recalled Luiselli’s onomatopoeic depiction of desert dust-clouds appearing and disappearing as “Shrrrrrr, sssssssss, hsssssss, sss, hhhhh,” or Jason De León’s graphic description of a mummified migrant corpse with a face “replaced by a stone-colored ghoul stuck in mid-scream” ? And what if they could digitally return to this location months later to hear the nocturnal chirp of a Whippoorwill that escaped their notice while they were previously there in person? To begin investigating these questions, I consulted the Institute for Digital Arts and Humanities (IDAH) at Indiana University Bloomington about multimedia map tools. A group of faculty, graduate students, and staff who specialize in digital methods, IDAH recommended Esri’s ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Survey 123 for their institutional availability and ease of use.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet, while Esri is the industry standard for commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software, its open partnerships with numerous private and public agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, initially give me pause. As the software that connects DHS’ vast system of remote sensors, lookout towers, drones, and other agent-carried GPS technologies, ArcGIS both facilitates and maximizes security enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border<a class="footnote-ref" href="#deleon2016"> [deleon2016] </a>. Yet, these very same technologies can likewise map and critique the systemic violence of such enforcement. Like De León, I thus began experimenting with co-optingthe master’s toolsby uploading various online resources into a map titled “Counter-mapping the U.S.-Mexico Border Crisis.”</p>
<p>The first resource was the open source data from the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants, from which I selectedunidentifiedremains and created color-coded survey points based on thebody conditionupon discovery. Such anonymity, along with conditions that range fromfully fleshedtoskeletonizaton w/ mummificationtocomplete skeletonization w/ bone degradation,emphasize the postmortem dehumanization of these human corpses. Especially in death, migrant bodies become indistinguishable from the landscape that both witnesses and facilitates their gradual decomposition. To further challenge human-nonhuman binaries, I next searched online for digital sounds and images representing the natural environment implicated in the U.S.-Mexico border crisis. This search yielded multiple relevant materials, including those from Sky Island Alliance’s Border Wildlife Study, Charles Bogert’s <em>Sounds of the American Southwest</em> , The Western Soundscape Archive, and The Acoustic Ecology Lab at Arizona State University.</p>
<p>While I was pleased with the variety of visual and auditory resources available online, an essential part of producing my counter-map was field photography and sound recording. When initially conceptualizing this project, I was set to lead additional <em>Conocimiento</em> trips and planned on including those students in on-the-ground data collection using the aforementioned ArcGIS Survey 123. The COVID-19 pandemic cancelled those plans, yet I was able to make multiple solo visits to Southern Arizona in 2020, including to Chiricahua National Monument in early March, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in late March, and the Huachuca Mountains in late September. Each of these places has a history of forced displacement, including the Apache Wars taking place around Chiricahua National Monument and ongoing border militarization happening throughout Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Huachuca Mountains. I visited Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument as the Trump administration expedited border wall construction along its southern edge, destroying local flora, animal habitat, and Tohono O’odham sacred sites in the process. Similar construction eventually reached the Huachuca Mountains in 2021, after I had already visited the area.</p>
<p>During these respective visits, I camped, hiked, and recorded what I encountered. With the continued support of IDAH, I was able to borrow their Sony IC recorder for short audio samples. While relatively basic, and prone to picking up wind sounds, this recorder still captures the spectrality that interests me most about soundscapes. Like the mother-protagonist in Luiselli’s <em>Lost Children Archive</em> , I listened for presence and absence, appearance and disappearance. And unlike the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, I did not map such listening with the purpose of definitively locating, tracking, or identifying anything. Instead, I aimed to use digital data and GIS software to record a multi-sensory experience of a landscape that humans cannot readily understand. For this reason, I recorded sonic environments that spontaneously intrigued me. There was never any recording schedule or inventory, though I did keep track of the date, time, and location of each recording. I did this because I would like to eventually return to these same places and listen for changes in the soundscape.</p>
<h2 id="results-and-discussion">Results and Discussion</h2>
<p>Joining Sterne, as well as Furlonge and Ceraso, in conceptualizing listening asa learned skill,I see the purpose of this counter-map to be practice: that is, the interminable practice of witnessing human bodies, as well as human-made maps, as in dynamic relation with environments that both includes and exceeds them. Against simplistic representations of the Sonoran Desert as hostile terrain rife with humanitarian crisis, “Counter-mapping the U.S.-Mexico Border Crisis” thus situates this landscape as endangered, biodiverse, and complex beyond absolute comprehension. While my ArcGIS map is still informative, especially to those who have not visited Southern Arizona in person, its multiple layers orient and disorient viewers simultaneously. Firstly, the diversity and quantity of information is overwhelming, as this digital map includes images, sounds, textual excerpts, animal ranges and migratory routes, border wall models, and hundreds of data points marking unidentified migrant remains. Secondly, many geotags include multiple types of media, thereby facilitatingsideways glancesin which map visitors think critically about this landscape, its history, and their sensory relationship to it all.</p>
<p>Given the continued disappearances and deaths of migrants crossing the Sonoran Desert, as well as the expedited construction of a new border wall system through wildlife corridors including the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and Madrean Sky Island Region and, structural violence in this region clearly affects humans and nonhumans alike. The Lesser Long-nosed Bat, one of many animals endangered by the habitat loss resulting from border crossing and militarization, migrates among various locations throughout Mexico and Southern Arizona, including the aforementioned wildlife corridors.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> The northern part of this route consists of the Chiricahua National Monument, one of my field research sites and a place referenced extensively by family members in Luiselli’s <em>Lost Children Archive</em> . Like this fictional family, I traced the Echo Canyon Trail, which descends into a dizzying maze of rhyolite hoodoos, or igneous rock spires. Since Luiselli’s father character claims you can listen to the voices of fallen Apaches in Echo Canyon, the son enters its depths, eagerly shouts Geronimo, and hears “it bouncing back even stronger and longer, Geronimo, eronimo, onimo, onimo” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#luiselli2019a"> [luiselli2019a] </a>. Yet, as I traversed this same location, I tried to be as silent as possible while extending my small Sony IC recorder in the air, pushing record, and appearing to capture nothing but wind gusts, audible<a href="https://services.arcgis.com/tKsJAIiLjd90D5q2/arcgis/rest/services/survey123_7cdf7e1c0f894bdc88def05f618c89cd/FeatureServer/0/19/attachments/16">here</a>.</p>

<p>Had I not added a photo, represented in Figure 6, to this same geotag on the map, it would be hard to hear the audio recording as also documenting hoodoos, or rock spires, standing en masse. Had I not added the audio recording to this same geotag, however, map visitors likely would miss the uncanny experience of not knowing all they are witnessing or, stated otherwise, all that is present, absent, and spectral here. Given Echo Canyon’s location along Lesser Long-nosed Bat migratory routes, for example, my recording could include ultrasonic echoes of last night’s echolocation calls. Technically, the chance of this happening is very low, if non-existent. Imaginatively, however, this chance is nevertheless enough to be politically and ethically relevant. For knowing the possibility of <em>not</em> knowing, or indeed hearing the possibility of <em>not</em> hearing, is disorienting. Interacting with this digital map, therefore, visitors do not necessarily lose their sense of direction, but they very likely lose their sense of being at the center of all action and knowledge, including that of the U.S.-Mexico Border crisis.</p>
<p>Just as De León claims that “people have to be decentered in the agency equation” of this crisis, I maintain that humans ought to be decentered from witnessing practices, including mapping. Yet, such decentering is admittedly difficult, especially given the anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism also prominent in sound studies. According to Deborah Kapchan, sound studies is still asking the key question of, “And how might attention to sound and affect produce a body unfettered by the dualisms of the Enlightenment — mind/body, nature/culture, man/woman, human/animal, spirit/material?” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#novak2015"> [novak2015] </a>. Acknowledging the field’s focus on humans, however, Sterne encourages continualinterrogationof our own hearing, as well as our access to nonhuman hearing, including that of animals, land, and technology<a class="footnote-ref" href="#novak2015"> [novak2015] </a>. For example, is it appropriate to say that land, and the geophones that pick up ground vibrations,hearanything at all? When an exhausted migrant falls to the desert floor, delirious from extreme dehydration, do the dirt, rocks, and nearby creatures even take notice? And when an ultrasonic recorder makes bat echolocation audible to humans, who, in fact, is doing the hearing? For Sterne, refraining from idealizing human and nonhuman hearing opens up new sets of questions about knowledge, subjectivity, and politics, namely politics that involve “hearing the hearing of others,” or at least trying<a class="footnote-ref" href="#novak2015"> [novak2015] </a>.</p>
<p>Following the Lesser Long-nosed Bat’s migratory route southward, towards Mexico, on my ArcGIS map, I include a likewise multivalent audio recording from Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, which houses Tohono O’odham burial sites and other endangered animals such as the Sonoran Pronghorn and Quitobaquito Pupfish. Upon first listen of this recording, audible<a href="https://services.arcgis.com/tKsJAIiLjd90D5q2/arcgis/rest/services/survey123_7cdf7e1c0f894bdc88def05f618c89cd/FeatureServer/0/28/attachments/21">here</a>, one may vaguely hear bird chirps, footsteps, a trickle of water, and some kind of traffic. Only the expert ear would be able to identify the specific sound of steamrollers cruising along Highway 85, having just left the site of border wall construction near Lukeville, Arizona, where they likely aided the hasty removal of local flora and fauna. Similarly, only the expert ear would be able to identify the specificities of a morning birdsong medley recorded from inside a nearby camping tent, audible<a href="https://services.arcgis.com/tKsJAIiLjd90D5q2/arcgis/rest/services/survey123_7cdf7e1c0f894bdc88def05f618c89cd/FeatureServer/0/33/attachments/28">here</a>. The point of this map, however, is not to train the expert ear, or even engage strictly ear-centric modes of listening. Rather, the point is to get map visitors thinking about what the human, including the human with digital technology, can and cannot witness in the Arizona desert: a landscape layered with historical, political, and environmental significance.</p>
<p>Like De León and Luiselli, I use this map to show that restoring the sight and sound, or voice and visibility, of human victims is insufficient to addressing the U.S.-Mexico border crisis. Rather than replace one mode of witnessing with another, however, this map models and facilitates a multi-modal, interdisciplinary interrogation of witnessing. As visitors navigate through images of landscapes, sounds of wildlife, and textual excerpts about local violence, they continually confront the challenge of comprehension, or understanding in an inclusive and absolute sense. Instead of providing easy or exhaustive answers, this digital counter-map invites participants into the ongoing question of hearing what the Sonoran Desert hears, as assassin, witness, and victim. Such inquiry is both orienting and disorienting, as it prompts viewers to engage the sensory and epistemological limits inherent to humanhood. Engaging these limits, however, also draws witnesses into closer, more attentive connection with the nonhuman ecosystems that both envelop and elude them.</p>
<p>Chances are that map visitors will never actually answer the complex question of hearing what the desert hears, yet asking it reminds them that such unknowns are also in crisis, and also worth protecting. As the Prevention Through Deterrence policy and other border militarization efforts remain in full effect, it is especially important to remember that the U.S.-Mexico border crisis necessitates epistemological and social, not just political, paradigm shifts. Indeed, it requires a decentering of visuality and anthropocentrism simultaneously, wherein witnesses recognize humanitarian and ecological issues as interrelated. As I have shown, this counter-mapping project contributes to such decentering by offering a practice of crossing the senses, leaning into disorientation, and collapsing human-nonhuman binaries. This practice is difficult and interminable, yet digital humanities pedagogies and projects like those I have demonstrated here also render it accessible, interactive, and impactful. At stake in such projects are not just “a reeducation of our senses” but also a reconfiguration of the world: a world that can better protect humans and nonhumans alike, together.</p>

Introduction</h2>
<h2 id="1-general-background">1. General background</h2>
<p>The Auschwitz Concentration Camp Complex was liberated seventy-seven years ago on the 27th January 1945. Since then the camp where an estimated 1.1 million people were murdered has became the symbol of the Holocaust. Despite the large number of studies and memoirs by survivors, the question to what extent solidarity and social bonds existed among victims is still open<a class="footnote-ref" href="#pingel2010"> [pingel2010] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#piper2009"> [piper2009] </a>. While some survivors claimed that friendships, mutual support, and solidarity among victims thrived, others have vehemently denied it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It has been recently argued that solidarity and social bonds were key to survive Nazi concentration camps; no one could survive without the help of others and mutual aid was a form of opposition among victims<a class="footnote-ref" href="#swiebocki2000"> [swiebocki2000] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#bacon2017"> [bacon2017] </a>. Nevertheless, it has been also noted, “conditions varied greatly across the vast Auschwitz complex” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#wachsmann2015"> [wachsmann2015] </a>. Some victims were therefore more likely to experience solidarity and form social bonds than others. Based on the close-reading of some victims’ accounts, some researchers have for instance suggested that group cohesion and solidarity were stronger among women, who were detained separately, than among men in Nazi death camps; however, in the lack of evidence, others have rejected this hypothesis<a class="footnote-ref" href="#pingel2010"> [pingel2010] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#schwarz1998"> [schwarz1998] </a>.</p>
<p>Even though a comparative study of how men and women behaved could enhance our understanding of the Holocaust from the victims’ perspective, producing evidence based insights into the world of Nazi concentration camps is challenging. Perpetrators destroyed camp documentation and victims’ perspective of the past is dispersed in tens of thousands of oral history interviews they gave. By watching a handful of interviews, we can gather only anecdotal evidence. At the moment, there is no reliable methodology to gather systematic evidence from a large number of oral history interviews. Traditional methods of corpus and computational linguistics cannot alone address this challenge. To produce systematic evidence from thousands of oral history interviews, it is important to account not only what is discussed but also how it is discussed. In other words, it is necessary to analyze how the narratives in thousands of oral history interviews unfold. We therefore developed a novel conceptual and computational approach adopted from the study of molecular processes. This novel method enabled us to study how narratives unfold in 2500 hours of oral history interviews with Auschwitz survivors. Even more importantly, it provided us with systematic evidence that among women solidarity and social bonds were stronger in Auschwitz.</p>
<p>Before presenting the results of our study, we introduce the dataset we worked with, the challenges it raises, and the way we tackled these challenges conceptually and computationally.</p>
<h2 id="2-our-dataset-and-its-historical-context">2. Our dataset and its historical context</h2>
<p>In this study we analyzed testimonies given by 6628 Jewish victims (2033 men and 4595 women) born in 13 different countries. The 6628 victims we worked with all stayed in the Birkenau sub-camp of the Auschwitz complex.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> In the Auschwitz camp system, Birkenau was the largest and the most lethal sub-camp where most Jewish victims were housed and perished.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> After arriving at the camp, the SS [ <em>Die Schutzstaffel</em> ], the Nazi paramilitary organization in charge of running death camps, selected those men and women who were able to work. Those who did not pass the arrival selection were murdered with Cyclon-B gas and cremated. Those few people who passed the arrival selection were deprived of their belongings, disinfected, registered (often tattooed) and forced to live in harsh conditions; men and women were housed in different sections of Birkenau. Victims often died due to starvation, various diseases, physical violence, and the extreme cold. During their stay in Birkenau, most victims had to work<a class="footnote-ref" href="#hayes2000"> [hayes2000] </a>. Sometimes the SS could, however, not keep pace with the influx of new deportees, and victims were waiting to get some work. There was also a large group of victims in Birkenau who never worked. Auschwitz-Birkenau was also a transit camp from where victims were sent to other camps. During the time (which could be quite long) that victims were waiting for transfer, they were, in fact, not given any work; they just hung around in the camp.</p>
<p>Our study is based on a data set that consists of oral history interviews with Holocaust victims. The USC Shoah Foundation provided us with this data set from its collection of approximately 50.000 Holocaust video testimonies recorded between 1981 and 2019. These video testimonies are preserved in the Visual History Archive of the Foundation at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Precisely, the Foundation gave us access to all of its interviews with Auschwitz survivors, which is a collection of 12200 Interviews in 26 different languages recorded in 47 different countries. We were also provided with basic biodata (gender and place of birth) about each survivor whose testimony is included. Given that we limited our investigation to Jewish victims who stayed in the Birkenau subcamp of the Auschwitz complex, we worked with 6829 interviews from the original data pool. These interviews were conducted in 26 different languages in 43 different countries.</p>
<p>Until today, only a small portion of USC Shoah Foundation’s testimonies have been transcribed and published<a class="footnote-ref" href="#toth2021"> [toth2021] </a>. In this study we could not therefore work with interview transcripts. We worked with the topical annotation of testimonies by the Foundation. In the last three decades, the professional staff of the Shoah Foundation indexed the minute based segments of each testimony with topic words from a designated thesaurus or controlled vocabularies. This thesaurus, a very large formally defined set of topic words, has been developed by the Foundation in the 1990s; the goal of the thesaurus is to cover all possible aspects of genocide experiences, including acts of solidarity and memories of social bonds<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gustman1998"> [gustman1998] </a>. Professional annotators (or indexers as the Foundation calls them) watched testimony videos and indexed their content with the help of topic words from the thesaurus in a purpose-built testimony database; visual and audio features of testimonies were not indexed.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this research the Foundation provided us access to the raw data underlying their testimony database.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The Foundation has reproduced, specifically for our study, all testimony segments, understood as a set of topic words (see a more technical description in the Implementation section), in which Auschwitz survivors discuss their stay in the camp. In our study, we relied exclusively on the English language topic words. Hence a limitation of our study is given by the fact that we were unable to study how topics related to solidarity and social bonds are discussed across testimonies in different languages. Another limitation of our study is that we were unable to work with the visual and audio aspects of the testimonies (see further discussion of these limitations in the Conclusion section).</p>
<h2 id="3-two-computational-challenges-related-to-survivor-testimonies">3. Two Computational Challenges Related to Survivor Testimonies</h2>
<p>Since the late 1970s archives and museums have been recording oral history interviews with Holocaust victims<a class="footnote-ref" href="#ecker2007"> [ecker2007] </a>. The large-scale study of these interviews could offer a unique insight into victims’ experience<a class="footnote-ref" href="#greenspan2012"> [greenspan2012] </a>. Nevertheless, oral history testimonies raise two key computational and conceptual challenges.</p>
<p>Researchers would need to account for not only which topics are present in individual testimonies but also how these topics are discussed across thousands of testimonies. On the one hand, survivors’ oral history interviews consist of questions and answers. On the other hand, a survivor testimony is a sequence of topics that together form a narrative about the past. Survivor testimonies can be thus seen as an ensemble of individual narrative processes. Given that interviews unfold over time, the ensemble of narrative processes has an underlying dynamic. The first computational challenge that survivor testimonies raise can be summarized in the following two questions:</p>
<p>How can we model the ensemble of narrative processes understood as sequences of topics unfolding over time?How can we measure the probability and the importance of topics in the ensemble of narrative processes?</p>
<p>The second challenge relates to the latter question. Survivor testimonies are mediated. Survivors gave testimonies decades after their liberation; their testimonies may have been shaped by post-Holocaust culture, including films and novels. Furthermore, survivors recall deeply traumatic memories, which are characterized by flashbacks and the suppression of certain particularly painful themes<a class="footnote-ref" href="#langer1993"> [langer1993] </a>. Some survivors might overemphasize the significance of certain topics such as solidarity and social bonds, while others might underestimate it. Finally, the existing oral history testimonies are only the tip of the iceberg. The overwhelming majority of victims never had the chance to speak. For all these reasons, we needed a computational model that can take the mediated nature of survivor testimonies into account when measuring the probability and the importance of topics in narrative processes.</p>
<h2 id="ii-methodology">II. Methodology</h2>
<h2 id="1-our-conceptual-framework">1. Our Conceptual Framework</h2>
<p>We developed a conceptual framework to tackle the problems above that is centered around three aspects: narrative system, narrative flux, and narrative pathway.</p>
<p>We define the narrative system as the ensemble of all possible topics that survivors address, including transitions between these topics. We represent the narrative system as a state space with topics as discrete states<a class="footnote-ref" href="#alpay2006"> [alpay2006] </a>. Each interview, which is viewed as a sequence of consecutive topics, is awalkingover the state space. In other words, each interview is a possible realization of the narrative system. Once all possible realizations were learned (see below), we could estimate the probability of each topic in the ensemble of all interviews. This approach also allowed us to compare testimonies of men and women. We viewed the interviews of each gender group as different instances of the same narrative system; we could thus compare the probabilities of topics that different instances yield (see the Implementation section).</p>
<p>To get insights into dynamics underlying narratives of survivors, we drew on the concepts of narrative pathway and narrative flux. In our conceptual framework, the narrative pathway describes a given sequence of states (i.e., topics) connecting two topics. The narrative flux quantifies the relative amount (percentage) of traffic going through a given narrative pathway. Consider the following example.</p>
<p>Two key topics in testimonies are arrival at a death camp (arrival) and discussion of social relations ( <em>social bonds</em> ). Testimonies can get from the topic arrival to the topic social bonds in many different ways. For instance, after discussing arrival, they can discuss the topic selection, and then social bonds. This corresponds to the narrative pathway <em>arrival → selections →</em> social bonds. The narrative flux considers all possible pathways between <em>arrival</em> and social bonds in the ensemble of all interviews (or interviews of women and interviews of men); then it tells us what fraction percentage goes through <em>selections</em> . In short, through the notion of narrative pathway and narrative flux, we can get insight into how narrative processes are likely to unfold in the ensemble of many testimonies.</p>

<p>From molecular physics we adopt the Markov State Model (MSM) and we perform a computational analysis of the ensemble of all interviews as a narrative system<a class="footnote-ref" href="#chodera2014"> [chodera2014] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#husic2018"> [husic2018] </a>. Specifically, we use the Transition Path Theory (TPT) framework to model the dynamics of a narrative system<a class="footnote-ref" href="#vanden2006"> [vanden2006] </a>.</p>
<p>In the context of our research, we interpret the ensemble of interviews as realizations of a Markovian dynamic system; this is defined over a state space consisting of all topics that survivors address. By drawing on the Markov State Model we obtain the stationary probability (also known as equilibrium state or stable probability) of each topic. In simple terms, this describes the overall probability of hearing a survivor mentioning a topic if we keep listening to interviews for a reasonably long time (see the Implementation section for technical details on and definition of overall probability).</p>
<p>We uncovered narrative pathways and quantified narrative flux by using the TPT, a quantitative framework based on MSMs<a class="footnote-ref" href="#metzner2009"> [metzner2009] </a>. In the context of studying narrations with MSMs, TPT is used as a means to organize and summarize large numbers of individual narrations (i.e. sequences of consecutive topics or narrative pathways as realized in thousands of interviews) and to make them accessible to our interpretation. In practice, TPT associates a number value (called the flux) to any possible narration (or any possible sequence of topics). This number tells us how prevalent a given narrative pathway is in the underlying corpus of interviews, i.e., it summarizes how likely it is that an interviewee reported about topics in a certain order. We can therefore use TPT to sort narrations by their prevalence, which also allows us to identify the most common narrations from the data.</p>
<p>This method was borrowed from dynamic systems modelling of molecular processes where TPT studies ensembles of reactive trajectories, i.e., trajectories that make transitions between defined starting state A and end state B.</p>
<p>In our work, we considered interviews as such trajectories. TPT therefore analyses narrations from a starting to an ending topic. We have chosen topics associated with camp detention as the starting and topics associated with liberation as the ending points. The narrations are therefore handled consistently and our results show prevalent narrations that are aligned to the Auschwitz-Birkenau experiences.</p>
<p>We used the technique of pathway decomposition, elaborated as part of TPT, to uncover the most important sequences of states (narrative pathways in our research) and to quantify the amount of traffic (or flux) that goes through a certain sequence of states. As a whole, we used the TPT to decompose the ensemble of all possible narrative pathways by ranking each of the pathways by their flux. This enabled us to identify thebusiestnarrative pathways that men and women used between a pair of topics.</p>
<p>Finally, based on our TPT analysis, we also model the narrative system as a directed graph. In this graph each topic (or a state in the state space model described above) is a node; the move of interviews from topic A to topic B is represented as an edge, which is weighted in terms of the probability of moving to topic B after topic A. To measure the importance and influence of each topic within the narrative system represented as a directed graph, we apply two different metrics. First, we measure the PageRank value of each topic as a node in the directed graph. The PageRank value is often used to measure the influence of humans in social networks, as well as the importance of webpages in Google search algorithms. By the same token as the PageRank value gives insight into the importance of webpages by modelling internet users movements from webpage to webpage, it reveals the importance of topics in survivor testimonies by modelling how these topics follow each other in testimonies. Actually, the PageRank values of nodes in a directed graph are closely related to the stationary probabilities described above; if a weighted directed graph represents a Markovian dynamic system, the PageRank values of nodes in the graph are the dumped stationary probabilities of states in the corresponding Markovian system<a class="footnote-ref" href="#page1999"> [page1999] </a>. The major advantage of the PageRank value is that it takes into consideration inbound and outbound links to a given node (topic in the context of our research), as well as the importance of connected nodes; hence the PageRank value expresses how embedded a given node is in the entire network<a class="footnote-ref" href="#lee2013"> [lee2013] </a>. Second, we calculate the normalized closeness centrality of each node. This evaluates importance by summing the shortest paths from a given node; in other words, it expresses how connected a given node (or topic in the context of our research) is<a class="footnote-ref" href="#freeman1978"> [freeman1978] </a>.</p>

<h2 id="1-understanding-the-significance-of-topics-related-to-solidarity-and-social-bonds-in-survivor-narratives">1. Understanding the significance of topics related to solidarity and social bonds in survivor narratives</h2>
<p>The 6628 Birkenau survivors we worked with discuss hundreds of topics when recalling their stay in the death camp; these topics cover many different aspects of camp life ranging from sanitary conditions to everyday interactions. As explained above, in the last three decades the Shoah Foundations’ indexer team watched these testimonies and annotated each testimony segment by means of topic words from the Foundation’s topical thesaurus. In total, there are 727 different topic words attached to interview segments related to Birkenau. However, many of these topics occur only in a few interviews. As a first step, a human agent with domain knowledge analyzed the 727 topic words and reduced them to 101 higher level topics (see Methodology). Next, we estimated the stationary probability of each higher level topic (when using probability we always mean the stationary probability of a topic). We specifically focused on two higher level topics: social bonds and aid giving. The former includes topics discussing social relations (friendships, camaraderie, non-intimate social relations etc.) in the camp; the latter relates to various acts of solidarity (food sharing, clothing provision, sustenance provision, etc.) We also calculated their closeness centrality and PageRank Value.</p>
<p>In the following, we ranked the topics according to stationary probability in descending order. This allowed us to identify the most probable topics in survivor narratives (see Figure 1).</p>

The font size of topics is adjusted according to their stationary probability. The wordcloud demonstrates that two key topics related to solidarity and social bonds (aid giving and social bonds in red) are among the most probable topics. The word cloud also demonstrates that they are as probable as tattoo and more probable than clothing (in red).

</figure>
<p>Not surprisingly, one of the most probable topics that survivors discuss is <em>selections</em> . This is the third most common topic after living conditions and camp procedures. Selection was a wanton and highly feared practice in Nazi death camps. All victims arriving at camps first underwent a selection procedure. Selection was also a daily routine in Nazi concentration camps; the SS kept eliminating the unfit and sending them to gas chambers. Since selection was a highly probable event, we used it as a reference point to assess the probability of topics describing solidarity and social relations. Compared to <em>social bonds</em> , the probability of <em>selections</em> is 3.4 times higher. Compared to <em>aid giving</em> , the probability of <em>selection</em> s is 2.28 times higher. <em>Aid giving</em> and <em>social bonds</em> are not as probable as <em>selections</em> . But they are still very probable if we take into consideration that on average <em>selections</em> is 92 times more probable than any other topic. The overall importance of <em>social relations</em> and <em>aid giving</em> are also demonstrated by the fact that they are part of the upper quantile in the ranking of all topics in terms of their stationary probabilities. <em>Aid giving</em> is the 14th most probable topic and <em>social bonds</em> is the 18th most probable topic. The ranking of topics by PageRank value resulted in similar results.</p>
<p>We also measured the normalized closeness centrality of <em>social bonds</em> and <em>aid giving</em> in the directed graph representing the narrative system. We found that the topic <em>aid giving</em> is the 4th most important element of survivor narratives and <em>social bonds</em> is the 20th most important element in survivor narratives. They are both part of the upper quantile.</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of the Markovian framework (see Implementation section), we could not harness specific forms of social bonds and acts of solidarity. Our approach was restricted to broader topics. In the next section, as part of a comparative analysis of narratives by women and men, we will combine the Markovian framework with inferential statistics, which will give insights into details of social relations and acts of solidarity.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight that survivors discuss a great deal of social activity and solidarity when recalling memories of Birkenau. It is important to underline that survivors were not asked by interviewers to address solidarity and social bonds in the camp. It was the survivors&rsquo; own decision to address these topics. In light of this, we think that what is recalled in the following testimony excerpt cannot be viewed as an anecdotal or nostalgic memory but in fact describes a relatively common experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We became friends with everybody — anybody and everybody. We — we — we really cared for each other. We did everything possible to try and encourage each other. If somebody wanted to hang themselves because they couldn&rsquo;t take it any more; we somehow talked &rsquo;em out of it. If somebody, for instance, said, I&rsquo;m giving up, I can&rsquo;t do it any more, we somehow talked them out of it. We maybe shared a little piece of bread. The bread was mostly made out of sawdust, but somehow we put a little piece of bread in his mouth. We did all kinds of those kinds of things.<br>

<h2 id="2-comparative-analysis-of-solidarity-and-social-relations-in-narratives-of-men-and-women">2. Comparative analysis of solidarity and social relations in narratives of men and women</h2>
<p>Men and women were detained and housed in different sections of Birkenau. We therefore examined and compared the probability of topics related to acts of solidarity and social bonds in narratives of women and men (see the Methodology section). To prove that differences were not due to either chance or sample bias, we used the method of bootstrapping (see below and the Methodology section)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#efron2004"> [efron2004] </a>. Again, we compared the importance of topics related to acts of solidarity and social bonds in narratives of men and women by drawing on normalized closeness centrality and the PageRank value. We also used the Fisher’s exact test to assess whether the difference is statistically significant (p value 0.05)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fisher1922"> [fisher1922] </a>. Finally, we measured the strength of association between gender and each topic with odds ratio analysis (Morris and Gardner, 1988). This enabled us to focus on specific forms of social bonds and acts of solidarity (see Figure 2).</p>

<p>We found that the topic <em>social bonds</em> is much more probable in testimonies of women; in their testimonies we are significantly more likely to hear about discussions of social relations in the camp. Our findings through bootstrapping is particularly revealing (see Figure 3). In short, over thousands of times we randomly sampled testimonies of women and men; each time we trained two Markov State Models over the same state space and measured the stationary probability of every topic. We observed that even if we randomly select testimonies of men and women, in the testimonies of women <em>social bonds</em> will always be more probable. The measurement of strength of association also confirmed this finding. <em>Social bonds</em> is positively correlated with women and negatively correlated with men. Finally, the normalized closeness centrality and the PagreRank value are also higher when testimonies of men and women are modeled as directed graphs.</p>
<p>In the case of the topic <em>aid giving</em> the difference between men and women is less strong. The probability of this topic is only by 7 percent higher in testimonies of women, even though the difference between men and women is statistically significant and remains consistent through the randomized sampling (see Figure 3). Similarly, the normalized closeness centrality and the PageRank value are higher for women.</p>

In other words, the difference between men and women is consistent and not due to sample bias.

<p>With the help of statistical significance testing and odds ratio analysis, we also examined specific forms of solidarity and social bonds (see Figure 2 and 3). The Shoah Foundation’s keyword thesaurus has various terms to describe different types of solidarity. For instance, the topic word <em>food sharing</em> describes moments when a survivor recalls an episode of food sharing in the camp. We found that in testimonies of women we are much more likely to hear about episodes of food sharing. Similarly, women are more likely to discuss memories about another person providing them with clothes (the topic of <em>clothing provision</em> ). Other topics related to solidarity, such as for instance <em>medical care provision</em> and <em>sustenance provision,</em> are also positively correlated with women, though they lack statistical significance. As a whole, we were unable to find any topic related to solidarity, which is positively correlated with men.</p>
<p>The Shoah Foundation’s keyword thesaurus is less rich in terms of details about social bonds. Its keywords <em>friends</em> and <em>friendships</em> describe moments when survivors discuss intimate bonds in the camp. Again, we found a very strong and statistically significant positive correlation with women and a negative correlation with men. Similarly, women are more likely to recall less intimate social bonds from the camp. Other topics related to sociability and solidarity feature a similar difference. For instance, topics describing cultural activity, or rumors are all positively correlated with women (see Figure 2) and feature statistical significance. Women are also more likely to discuss suicide attempts in the camp.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also found interesting commonalities between men and women. It is a leitmotif in testimonies that victims warned each other. We did not find a significant difference in terms of the probability of hearing about this topic (see Figure 7). Another commonality is stealing (see Figure 6); victims often discuss memories about other victims stealing from them; men and women are equally likely to recall this experience. Finally, preferential treatment by camp functionaries is also equally likely to be recalled by both men and women (see Figure 8).</p>

<p>We also looked at those topics that dominate men&rsquo;s recalling of Auschwitz-Birkenau (see Figure 3). We found that men are more likely to recall topics related to physical violence (killings, beatings, executions, etc). Furthermore, we found that topics related to various clandestine activities (bribery, resistance, covert activities) are also more correlated with men than with women.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we examined whether the difference between women and men can be also observed if we compare men and women of the same nationalities. We found that the probability of topics related to social bonds and solidarity are either higher for women or there is no difference. We were unable to find any nationality where the probability of topics related to solidarity and social bonds would be higher for men.</p>
<p>By further partitioning the data, we also surveyed women and men who did not work while they were in Birkenau. We observed the same trend as above. In narratives of women who did not report any forced labour activity, topics related to solidarity and social bonds are more probable.</p>
<p>Finally, we also studied the testimonies of those women and men who had to work. Given that the forced labour type and its difficulty varied a lot in Nazi death camps, we first divided the forced labour activities into three groups based on physical effort demands: easy work (secretarial work, science/research-related forced labor, translation etc), medium hard work (tattooing, factory work, gas chamber cleaning, etc), very hard physical work (mining, road and rail construction, etc). In our dataset, percentages of women and men who did the same type of work are quite similar. The majority of men (16.5% of all men survivors) and women survivors (14.5% of all women survivors) reported medium hard work. Even when comparing the working population of Birkenau, we could observe the trend that in narratives of women, topics related to social relations, friendships, and food sharing are more probable. However, there was no difference in the probability of the topic <em>aid giving</em> . This is equally probable in narratives of men and women who worked while they stayed in Birkenau.</p>
<h2 id="3-narrative-pathways-leading-to-and-from-topics-of-solidarity-and-social-bonds">3. Narrative pathways leading to and from topics of solidarity and social bonds</h2>
<p>Using TPT, we found that both men and women discuss solidarity in the context of the everyday living environment (i.e., camp barrack) and forced labour activity, which is an interesting commonality. However, when we examined the narrative flux that goes through the most important narrative pathways leading to acts of solidarity in narratives of women and men, we found an important difference: women are more likely than men to discuss acts of solidarity in the context of camp barracks (see Figure 10 and Figure 12).</p>

<p>We examined all possible pathways leading from the topic <em>arrival</em> to the topic <em>aid giving</em> in narratives of men and women. In narratives of women, more traffic is found going through the pathways in which <em>aid giving</em> is preceded by the topic <em>living conditions.</em> For instance, the following narrative pathway is present in both men and women testimonies, but again, in testimonies of women the narrative flux (7.8%) is higher than in testimonies of men (5.2%):</p>
<p><em>arrival</em> → <em>selections</em> → <em>intake procedures</em> → <em>living conditions</em> → <em>aid giving</em></p>
<p>The investigation of narrative pathways connecting the topic <em>living conditions</em> with the topic <em>aid giving</em> also confirmed that women are more likely to connect solidarity with the world of their barracks.</p>
<p>We also found that in testimonies of women the discussion of social relations is more likely to be preceded by the discussion of living environments.

<p>To sum up, the way men and women discuss social relations and solidarity feature notable similarities. They both tend to discuss them following topics related to living and housing conditions and forced labor. Nevertheless, we also found that women are more likely to discuss social activity and acts of solidarity in the context of the everyday living environment; by contrast men tend to discuss solidarity and social relations in the context of forced labour. All this suggests that women mainly socialized in their barracks, whereas men experienced solidarity and social interactions in the working environment.</p>
<h2 id="3-conclusion">3. Conclusion</h2>
<h2 id="1-discussion-of-results">1. Discussion of results</h2>
<p>The availability of large survivor testimony datasets is now making it possible to accomplish evidence based studies of victims’ experience during the Holocaust. A key problem has been how best to study thousands of testimonies together and produce systematic evidence. We modeled the testimonies of 6628 Auschwitz-Birkenau survivors with MSM, which &lsquo;summarized&rsquo; the narratives underlying these testimonies. This gave us an unprecedented insight into victims’ experience.</p>
<p>We found that acts of solidarity and social ties among victims were not at all uncommon in Auschwitz-Birkenau. The significance of this finding can be understood in light of what researchers and survivors often described as dehumanization. The following words by a Hungarian survivor, demonstrate what dehumanization meant in Auschwitz-Birkenau:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, you know, it&rsquo;s very hard to explain how logic or emotion doesn&rsquo;t come into it. You&rsquo;re fighting for your life. You&rsquo;re fighting for a piece of bread. You don&rsquo;t think, now what do I think is happening? It&rsquo;s happening. You&rsquo;re glad today you weren&rsquo;t beaten. You&rsquo;re glad yesterday you had a mouthful more bread. You — you don&rsquo;t speculate. So this one was run onto the wire and got killed. Fine, she&rsquo;s. She&rsquo;s lucky. I&rsquo;m not lucky. Because I haven&rsquo;t got the guts to do it. So that is the mentality. You know, that&rsquo;s how you live. You&rsquo;re not a human. You&rsquo;re dehumanized. You don&rsquo;t think. You follow instructions like an animal, not even — an animal wouldn&rsquo;t listen to it. So you become a piece of robot really, which if you don&rsquo;t where emotions and hunger meets or takes over.<br>
<a class="footnote-ref" href="#neumann1996"> [neumann1996] </a><br>
By reducing victims into a dehumanized state, the SS deliberately thwarted victims’ otherwise natural effort to take care of each other. Furthermore, the SS deliberately undermined social bonds between victims by frequently transferring them between forced labour squads, camps, and barracks. As the historian, Gideon Greif, has put it, “the Nazi camp system aimed to break down all solidarity human relations as well as the belief in the possibility of self-determined actions” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#greif1999"> [greif1999] </a>. The question whether some form of solidarity and sociability could still exist in Auschwitz-Birkenau therefore translates into the question of how successful the SS was in its effort to destroy the human nature of victims. Accounts such as the one above or the testimony excerpt cited at the beginning of this paper have often convinced researchers that solidarity and deeper human ties were actually anomalies in Auschwitz. For instance, the sociologist, Wolfgang Sofsky, has recently described the Nazi death camp as a place where victims lived in “a social state of nature in which the person who prevailed was the one who was stronger” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#sofsky2013"> [sofsky2013] </a>. This view is in contrast with the accounts of many survivors and with the findings of some historians. Again, as one survivor cited above said, “we did everything possible to try and encourage each other.” The hypothesis that solidarity and social bonds among victims were just anomalies in Auschwitz is also in contrast with our findings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, the 6628 survivors in our dataset do speak about a great deal of solidarity and social interactions. Acts of solidarity and memories of social life are highly important elements of their memories. Their importance and high probability within the narrative system indicates that they were also significant and relatively frequent elements of camp life. Even if statistical frequencies and probabilities of topics measured by modelling thousands of narratives cannot be equated with the broader and non-statistical concept of importance, they can still be treated as reliable indicators giving information about the world that these narratives recall. As a matter of fact, we will never know how victims lived in Nazi death camps. But by analyzing thousands of survivor narratives, we can attempt to construct estimates about basic aspects of life in Nazi death camps.</p>
<p>Our computational approach also allowed us to compare the narratives of women and men and to shed light on a key difference: in testimonies of women solidarity and social relations are more probable and more important topics than in testimonies of men. Based on the close reading of a handful of testimonies, this gender difference has been already noticed but lacked the backing of wide-scale quantitative evidence. In this study, we provide systematic evidence that in narratives of women survivors of Auschwitz-Birkenau solidarity and social relations are much more important topics.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this finding leads to a key problem that any study of belated memories about a past event involves. Memory sometimes alters the way humans see their past; therefore, we need to ask how can we produce evidence about the past by drawing on belated memories? Taking this question into the context of this study, to what extent does the fact that in belated memories of women solidarity and social bonds are more probable, indicate that they were also more prevalent in the women sections of Birkenau? We tackled this problem with the help of bootstrapping, i.e., with the help of randomized trials. It is possible that some women overestimate the importance of solidarity and social relations in the past and some men underestimate their significance; it is possible that memory and post-Holocaust experience (including watching specific films and reading Holocaust novels) have &ldquo;sweetened&rdquo; the experiences made in the past for some women and triggered bitterness in some men. Nevertheless, with the help of randomized samples we pointed out that the difference between men and women is consistent. If our initial finding that solidarity and social relations are more probable in narratives of women would have been due to the sweetening effect of nostalgic memory or due to sampling bias, the difference between men and women would have faded over thousands of randomized trials.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that women generally tend to show more solidarity in extreme circumstances such as detainment. However, it is important to highlight a historical factor as a result of which social adaptation for Jewish men in Birkenau must have been particularly difficult. By the time that mass deportations of European Jewry to Auschwitz-Birkenau began, many of the young and middle aged Jewish men had already been in forced labour service<a class="footnote-ref" href="#gruner2006"> [gruner2006] </a>. Most of the men who were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau were older men; they had therefore very slim chances to survive the selection process at the arrival. As a result, most probably there were more women of the same nationalities than men of the same nationalities. Being surrounded by women of the same nationality, a woman could find solidarity and friends much easier than a man. To corroborate this explanation, we would however need to know more about whom women formed friendships with and who offered solidarity and help to them.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="2-limitations-of-our-methodology">2. Limitations of our methodology</h2>
<p>This points out the limitation of this study. We could study only those topics that the Shoah Foundation’s index system covers. Unfortunately, the index system does not offer any information about whom victims were friends with. Neither does it contain keywords that signal conflicts between victims. We could not therefore study whether men or women are more likely to recall animosity. Similarly, the use of generalized keywords to describe human behavior has its own limitations since they cannot describe the richness and subtleties of human behavior. For instance, friendship and aid giving are complex concepts and behavioral patterns with many different possible meanings and nuances that a general keyword cannot describe. This limitation can in part explain the difference between men and women. When discussing social relations in the camp, women and men might express their ideas and memories very differently. Where women use friendship, men might for instance use other words that suggest less intimate social bonds. Unfortunately, the unified keyword system cannot account for such differences and the close-listening of 2500 hours of survivor testimonies is not viable.</p>
<p>Another limitation of our study is that we could not work with interview transcripts in the original languages. Interviewees of different languages might have expressed similar experiences in different ways, which in turn might have produced unevenness in the topical annotation. For instance, victims of different linguistic backgrounds may use very different linguistic strategies to account experiences of social bonds and aid giving.</p>
<p>Finally, topical annotation cannot address a key feature of traumatic narration. This is silence. Traumatic memories often remain suppressed and speakers lack the linguistic ability to articulate them. Hence, the bulk of traumatic memory can hardly be described with unified topic words.</p>
<h2 id="3-implications-for-future-research">3. Implications for future research</h2>
<p>Despite these limitations, the use of the Markov State Model has helped to tackle an old problem that among others, the Italian survivor of Auschwitz and the author of many Holocaust novels, Primo Levi (1917 - 1987), has pinpointed. This is the fallacy of the individual memory of a survivor. As Levi said, the human memory is a marvelous instrument but it makes mistakes<a class="footnote-ref" href="#levi1986"> [levi1986] </a>. The fallacy of individual memories can be counterbalanced with the study of the memory of many survivors. But the study of many individual memories poses its own challenges: testimonies are mediated and unbalanced in terms of gender for instance; they miss the voice of those who did not survive or did not give a testimony. To face these challenges, in this paper we applied the Markov State Model combined with the Transition Path Theory. This enabled us to approach thousands of individual testimonies as expressions of the collective experience. Most importantly, it enabled us to compare narratives of women and men. Future work can use the methods we present in this paper to study victims’ experience in other Nazi death camps.</p>
<p>Future work can also rely on our methodological and conceptual approach to study a great variety of big data involving sequences of states in the humanities. Such datasets are ubiquitous in history and in other humanities fields. Datasets of national biographies, for instance the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, could be studied by representing historical actors’ life trajectories as sequences of states. Similarly, the circulation of artistic objects among different owners (so-calledobject biographies) can be represented as sequences of states. The concept of state space and the Markov State Model can be applied to model and analyze these sequences of states. Most importantly, a methodology and conceptual framework applied to understand processes both in nature and in human civilizations can offer new bridges between science and humanities in the future.</p>
<h2 id="iv-implementation">IV. Implementation</h2>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>In this paper we discuss our methodology and its implementation in two different sections. The Methodology section above aimed to offer a general overview of our methodology. Here we describe step-by-step how we implemented our methodology. In addition to the step-by-step description, Figure 15 and 16 also help understand the key steps in the implementation process. At the same time, for a complete understanding of the implementation, readers might need some background in probabilistic modeling, which we cannot provide here.</p>

        <p>Methodological Overview 1: From individual interviews to the modelling of 6628 interviews as a Markovian dynamic system. A, a single interview is processed into 1 minute segments that are assigned to topic terms each (color-coded). Interviews are therefore represented as sequences of consecutive topics (or narrative pathways). B The whole interview corpus consists of 6628 interviews that are converted into 6628 series of topic terms. B, Transition matrix that summarises the probabilities of hearing about a given topic following another topic as learned from all available interviews. The transition matrix can also be represented as a directed graph; nodes are the topics and the edge weights are the probabilities that an interviewee move from one topic to another, it therefore stores all possible narrative trajectories that a recalling of Auschwitz can follow in the corpus of all interviews. D. The “busiest” (or the most prevalent) narrative pathways obtained by means of Transition path theory (TPT). TPT extracts prevalent narrations from the MSM transition matrix; a narration is here depicted as a (possibly non-linear) sequence of topics that goes from left to right. Please note that this figure is a conceptual overview and does not represent real interview data.

<h2 id="2-preprocessing">2. Preprocessing</h2>
<p>In this research project we worked with the topic words that the trained expert human annotators of the Shoah Foundation had assigned to minute based segments of interviews in our data set. As a first step, we applied a feature engineering procedure; we grouped topic words and formed higher level topics. In total, we identified 101 higher level topics. Our feature selection procedure followed the keyword thesaurus of the Shoah Foundation. In this thesaurus each topic is clearly defined and formally not overlapping.</p>
<p>The interview dataset we worked with is a set of matrices. Each matrix represents an interview; the rows correspond to minute-based interview segments and the columns represent the topic words associated (higher level topics as described above) with segments as a “one-hot-encoding”. This segment-topic word matrix is similar to document-term matrices used in bag-of-words models of document collections in text mining. We can also view each segment-topic word matrix as a sequence of topics that form a discrete narrative pathway; hence we first represented the interviews as sets of consecutive topics.</p>
<p>Interview_1 = {topic 3, topic 1, topic 2 ………. topic n}</p>
<p>Interview_2 = {topic 4, topic 3, topic 2 ………. topic n}</p>
<p>Sometimes an interview segment can feature multiple topics. Consider the following example:</p>
<p>Interview_3 = {topic 3 -&gt; topic 1, topic 4 -&gt; topic 2}</p>
<p>Given that multiple topics may be assigned to certain segments, there is a fuzziness in the interview topic assignment. We address this fuzziness by randomly sampling from the topics of multi-topic segments. For instance, in case two topics are assigned to a segment, we treat it such that they could have occurred with either topic.</p>
<p>Interview_3_A = {topic 3 -&gt; topic 1-&gt; topic 2}</p>
<p>Interview_3_B = {topic 3 -&gt; topic 4-&gt; topic 2}</p>
<p>As we do not alter the sequence of topics, the dynamics is conserved. In other words, we interpret an interview as a set of pathways that are compressed into a single pathway with multi-topic segments, and therefore disentangle it into single pathways.</p>
<h2 id="3-the-construction-of-a-state-space-and-its-markov-modelling">3. The construction of a state space and its Markov modelling</h2>
<p>Next, we construct a state space from the sets of discrete narrative pathways. Each topic term is assigned a state number to allow further numerical processing; the topics are interpreted as discrete states of the state space. We treat each narrative pathway (i.e., interview) as walking over a state space that is spanned by the topic terms. The transition probabilities between discrete states are stored in a transition (probability) matrix. This is an n-by-n square matrix with n corresponding to the number of discrete states. The <em>ij-</em> th element of our transition matrix describes the probability that an interview discusses topic <em>i</em> after having addressed topic <em>j</em> . In molecular kinetics, this is called a conditional probability<a class="footnote-ref" href="#prinz2011"> [prinz2011] </a>. In the context of our research, the transition (probability) matrix models the narrative system consisting of discrete states that are the topic terms; it also represents the way interviews are likely to move from one topic to another topic. We also use the transition matrix as an adjacency matrix; from this we construct the directed graph representing the narrative network of topics.</p>
<p>The transition matrix is the central object of the MSM. However, as the transition matrix describes the probability of hearing topic <em>i</em> in the future <em>, conditioned on topic j in the present,</em> it does not tell the (unconditional) probability of topic <em>i</em> irrespectively of the previous topic. We can however estimate the unconditional probability, also referred to as stationary and equilibrium state probability earlier, by noting that it is the stable state that the system converges to in the limit of infinite time. It is often denoted by π and follows from applying the dynamics n → ∞ times, i.e. π = lim n → ∞ p0. It can be computed either by calculating the limit explicitly, or as the left eigenvector of the transition matrix that corresponds to eigenvalue 1. We applied this latter technique, also known as spectral decomposition of the transition matrix<a class="footnote-ref" href="#prinz2011"> [prinz2011] </a>; specifically, we used the pyemma software package<a class="footnote-ref" href="#scherer2015"> [scherer2015] </a>. The resulting MSM stationary distribution can be approached as an estimator of the unconditional probability of a dynamic system in equilibrium. In the context of our research, the unconditional probability of a topic gives the overall probability that we will hear about this topic irrespectively of the preceding topic.</p>
<h2 id="4-application-of-tpt-for-the-study-of-narrative-pathways">4. Application of TPT for the study of narrative pathways</h2>
<p>To shed light upon the full network of narrations, we compute the TPT flux network between start topic A and end topic B<a class="footnote-ref" href="#scherer2015"> [scherer2015] </a>. In brief, TPT defines the committor <em>q</em> + as the probability that on a pathway from A to B, at a given intermediate step of that pathway, we reach B before going back to A. In the context of this manuscript, the committor thus describes the probability that during a specific narration (defined by its starting topic A and ending topic B), the narrator speaking about an intermediate topic first reaches the end topic B before talking about the start topic A again. The backward committor analogously describes the probability to go back to A before visiting B. From these two definitions, the current (usually referred to as the reactive flux) between two topics <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> can be computed by multiplying the backward committor of <em>i</em> with the stationary probability of that topic and with the transition probability to change from that topic <em>i</em> to another topic <em>j</em> , multiplied by the committor of <em>j</em> .</p>
<p>To span the full flux network, this expression is evaluated between all topic terms for a given narration. In order to simplify the presented networks, we choose a cutoff of 0.25 below which we do not display a given link. The graph layout is conducted using a few-step general graph-layout algorithm (Fruchtermann-Reingold) started from points distributed according to their committor probability on the x-axis<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fruchterman1991"> [fruchterman1991] </a>.</p>
<h2 id="5-comparative-analysis-of-narratives-by-women-and-men">5. Comparative analysis of narratives by women and men</h2>
<p>To assess different kinds of sub-samples (e.g. women or men), the initial sets of narrative pathways are split according to biographical information known about the interviewee. Independent MSM estimates are established for each of these data sets. We compare unconditional probabilities per topic between different datasets by computing the ratio between them. This is possible as the full state spaces of the compared MSMs are spanned by the same set of topics. Furthermore, converged MSM estimates of unconditional probabilities do not depend on sample size. The estimates are thus not biased by different sample sizes as long as they are converged. Topics that are not in the active set of either MSM are not used for comparison. We estimate the error of probability estimates by bootstrapping of trajectories, i.e., we have re-evaluated the investigated models by drawing the same number of interviews from our database at random (with replacement). This is repeated 1000 times to estimate a posterior distribution of the MSM stationary probabilities.</p>
<h2 id="6-validation-of-results">6. Validation of results</h2>
<p>To validate our findings, on the one hand we use the implied timescales test<a class="footnote-ref" href="#wehmeyer2019"> [wehmeyer2019] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#bowman2014"> [bowman2014] </a>. This tests for the convergence of the model with the chosen lag time, which is a necessary condition for the data’s Markovianity. On the other hand, to validate our results with a different method, we also drew on the direct counting of how many times a given topic occurs in testimonies of men and women. We compared the proportion of women who mention a given topic to the proportion of men who also mention that topic. We divided the data sample into men and women on the one hand, to those that mention and do not mention a topic on the other. For each topic this produced a 2x2 contingency table: number of women mentioning a topic, number of women not mentioning a topic; number of men mentioning a topic, number of men not mentioning a topic. To assess whether the difference between men and women is significant, we applied the Fisher exact test on the contingency tables representing each topic (p-value 0.05). This revealed whether the difference between men and women is due to chance (null-hypothesis) or whether there is a correlation between gender and the fact that a topic word is mentioned. Finally, we measured the strength of correlation between gender and a topic word with the help of odds ratio analysis<a class="footnote-ref" href="#morris1988"> [morris1988] </a>.</p>

<p>The following account by a German Jewish survivor of Auschwitz illustrates the sharp contrast between the two opinions: “And I should preface this by saying, in general, you know, I&rsquo;ve read a lot — a lot of claims about the solidarity of prisoners under those conditions. And I must tell you I&rsquo;ve never seen it. I&rsquo;ve heard about solidarity in the block occupied by Russian officers, Red Army officers. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure that was the only — if — if at all, that was the only group that showed any solidarity whatsoever. The atmosphere in the camp was such that everybody was out for their own survival. And if it was a question of — of listening in to what your neighbors in the bed said, it would immediately be handed on so that — for personal profit. You couldn&rsquo;t trust anybody. And nobody trusted anybody.” <a class="footnote-ref" href="#chrambach1996"> [chrambach1996] </a>.

<p>The Auschwitz complex came to existence in the Spring of 1940 in Southern Poland (that time part of Nazi Germany) about 70 km from Cracow. Over the subsequent years, the complex continued to grow incorporating various sub-camps.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The construction of Auschwitz-Birkenau (renamed Auschwitz II in November, 1943) began in the Autumn of 1941 and started to receive deportees from the Spring of 1942. In addition to an extremely large Jewish population, Birkenau also housed Polish and Roma victims. It was both a killing center, equipped with gas chambers and crematoria, and a work camp where victims were forced to slave labour. Victims were transported by trains to Birkenau from various European countries.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>For instance, the mass deportations of the Hungarian Jewry began in the Spring of 1944. Hungarian Jewish men had been taken to forced labour from 1941. The vast majority of younger Hungarian Jewish men were not deported to Auschwitz<a class="footnote-ref" href="#braham1977"> [braham1977] </a><a class="footnote-ref" href="#michelbacher2020"> [michelbacher2020] </a>.## Bibliography&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
