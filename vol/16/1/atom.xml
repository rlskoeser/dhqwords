<p><em>It is much to be regretted that no lives of maids… are to be found in the Dictionary of National Biography.</em></p>
<p>– Virginia Woolf,  _Three Guineas _  (1938)</p>
<p>Prosopography, a form of collective life writing that documents the characteristics of a group, has a long and gendered history. Developed as a historical research method in the second half of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, by scholars studying populations including Ancient Rome and seventeenth-century English Puritans <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, much early prosopographical research focused on the lives of men. In the twenty-first century, we have inherited the legacy of this research; 85% of the entries in the  _Oxford Dictionary of National Biography _ ( <em>ODNB</em> ), a Victorian project begun by Sir Leslie Stephen, are of notable men.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  Yet, in the same historical period, prosopography has been a congenial form for documenting women’s lives. As Alison Booth reminds us, in volume form, the collected lives of women have thrived since at least the second half of the nineteenth century, when the publication of volumes aimed at a general audience of (female) readers tripled and then quadrupled every decade, remaining a popular form to the present day <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Booth identifies  <em>Collective Biographies of Women</em>  from as far back as the Middle Ages and notes that  “Catalogs of notable women have flourished in plain view for centuries, while generation after generation laments the absence of women from the past”   <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. On the one hand, then, women have been given short shrift in scholarly prosopographies such as the  <em>ODNB</em> . On the other hand, prosopography is one genre in which the lives of women and other marginalized groups have often flourished, in part because the collective form does not require believing that any individual woman is important enough to merit full-length biographical treatment, but rather that women’s history in general is important.</p>
<p>In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the gendered history of prosopography has become intertwined with that of the digital humanities. Some of the most important early feminist digital humanities projects, including  <em>The Orlando Project</em>   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>,  <em>The Women Writers Project</em>   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, and the  <em>Collective Biographies of Women</em>   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, analyze and generate prosopographies centered around women, in part because digitization offers the promise of more space to represent women’s writing and women’s lives freed from the constraints of the codex form. Of course, all projects remain bound by other constraints, including time and funding, and as Julia Flanders et al remind us in their work on encoding proper names, we must ask ourselves honestly about the feasibility and utility of this markup <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. There is a tension, then, in prosopography, between a necessary selectivity about which figures to include given the restraints imposed by the prosopographical format, whether it is a short chapter in a collective biography or a predetermined set of fields in a database, and a desire for greater inclusivity, especially in terms of representing marginalized lives. Yet, as we argue here, it is also possible for the restraints of the prosopographical format to be generative.</p>
<p>In this paper, through a case study of a TEI edition of the letters of the popular Victorian novelist, Dinah Craik, we argue that the restraint imposed by the TEI template can lead us to a more inclusive prosopography, both in terms of the people included, and in the information-seeking methods we use to collect data on historical figures. Our project encodes and gives biographical detail not only for every person named in the letters, but also every person referenced but not necessarily named, many of whom are women referenced only as sisters, wives, and servants. TEI templates such as the one we use in  <em>Digital Dinah Craik</em>  may seem constraining; however, as as Jacqueline Wernimont argues in her writing on  <em>The Orlando Project</em> , technologies such as  <em>The Orlando Project</em> s’s XML Document Type Definition (DTD) can be read as generative and  “productive of a model of the text, but not the sole or authoritative model”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. We follow Wernimont in arguing for the generative possibilities of mark up; in our case, the establishment of a TEI prosopographical template creates an imperative to fill every element and attribute, a departure from more selective standard editorial practice for nineteenth-century letters. We extend recent work in digital prosopography that explores the complex process of modelling people as data <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> by demonstrating how we have combined scholarly tools such as the TEI with para-scholarly genealogical databases and recently digitized nineteenth-century newspapers and books to give the fullest account of each  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry possible. This approach is labor-intensive, and our project has relied heavily on the expertise and labor of student research assistants and librarians, as well as on external funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).</p>
<p>Given the work-intensive nature of our approach, a second goal of this paper is to highlight the affective labor of data collection, and the ingenuity involved in toggling back and forth between multiple sources to uncover data about nineteenth-century women who have left little trace. This type of research does not often receive the credit that other forms of scholarship do. Susan Brown argues that  “activities of practical benefit to others”  in the digital humanities, including  “structuring, manipulating, transforming, or remediating data”  can be defined as service labor in the digital humanities; this type of service labor, which often takes place in the library or is closely associated with librarianship, is feminized and less prestigious than other forms of scholarship <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. In writing about our method of data collection in detail, we respond to recent calls in feminist digital humanities to recognize the labor and material conditions involved in data collection. Elizabeth Losh and Wernimont use the acronym MEALS to signal their feminist emphasis on how the  “material, embodied, affective, labor-intensive, and situated character of engagements with computation can operate experientially for users in shared spaces.”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. Catherine D&rsquo;Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein point out that when data products are released to the public, the workers who collected the data and processed them for use are rarely credited. D’Ignazio and Klein make a feminist argument for showing the work involved in the entire life cycle of the project <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  Midway through our project, we aim to document our data collection as a feminist practice.</p>
<p>The  <em>Digital Dinah Craik</em>  project has been ongoing at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, since January 2015 and now includes more than 400 letters published with Northeastern University’s TEI Archive Publishing and Access Service (TAPAS), and an accompanying prosopography that offers an inclusive and standardized set of information on every person mentioned by name or by reference in Craik’s letters. These encoded letters constitute the first phase of our project, in which we have focused on letters written by Craik and addressed to her publishers and other acquaintances in artistic and literary fields.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  Craik’s letters are important not only because they shed light on the career of an important and well-connected author, but because of what they can tell us about the venues and types of publications and networks of connection that could sustain a nineteenth-century woman writer’s career for upwards of forty years. Craik’s career is remarkable not only for its success and length but for the literary sociability that sustained it, as she maintained relationships with writers, publishers and artists from her adolescent years to her death. Writing about digital editions of early modern correspondence, Camille Desenclos argues that one of the main aims of editing correspondence is  “the (re)-constitution of networks” ; through  “links created first between the sender and the addressee and then between the different people mentioned within the letters, a social, commercial and even cultural network can be reconstructed”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Craik’s letters are a testament to the power of social networks in a woman writer’s career, especially those centered around the home like that of Anna Maria and Samuel Carter Hall’s literary salon. Ultimately, we plan to use our encoded letters and prosopography to analyze Craik’s networks, but in this paper we focus on the methods we have developed to build an inclusive prosopography that helps our users glean meaning from component parts of the digital edition.</p>
<p>Our work builds on scholarship in feminist and queer digital prosopography which focuses on the complex processes of modeling people as data, rather than on a final statistical analysis of a completed prosopographical dataset.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  In their prosopography for the  <em>Yellow Nineties</em>  project, Alison Hedley and Lorraine Janzen Kooistra explore what it means to build a prosopography, a form that tends to work by  “flattening out differences and anomalies to create a typical subject,”  based on an understanding that identity is intersectional,  “fluid and contingent”   <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. As Hedley and Kooistra note, the constraints of the TEI can guide prosopographical research while also affording flexibility in describing individual lives. They find that it is possible to  “tailor the extensible markup language (XML)”  of the TEI using elements such as  <code>&lt;addName&gt;</code>  to account for nineteenth-century figures such as William Sharp, who not only wrote under the pseudonym Fiona Macleod but also created a  “social, legal, and textual network”  as Macleod that allowed Sharp to live a second life with  “a feminine literary persona”   <sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  Similarly, in the Lesbian and Gay Liberation in Canada Project, Michelle Schwartz and Constance Crompton create a TEI prosopography that seeks to document the complexity of gay and lesbian lives in Canada rather than to  “reduce liberationists to a few statistical averages”   <sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Following these scholars, we argue for a more expansive and inclusive form of digital prosopography, both in terms of which historical figures merit inclusion in a prosopography, and in terms of our information-seeking methods for prosopographical research. In making this twofold argument for inclusive prosopography, we demonstrate a method of research that makes full use of digitized records and information retrieval sources now available to us, regardless of their perceived scholarly value.</p>
<p>While our focus in this paper is on developing an inclusive method for generating a TEI prosopography, much of the research on prosopography has focused on how scholars might make the best use of a completed prosopographical dataset, whether it is to support research questions about a historical group of people or to integrate a prosopography created using one technology with another one (for example, transforming a TEI prosopography to Linked Open Data). In collecting standardized biographical data on a large number of people, prosopography enables researchers to aggregate individual lives and make data-driven claims, for example, about the average life of a Roman slave or the relationship between Puritanism and a positive attitude toward science <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Prosopography also has a long relationship with genealogy, which has been used to uncover individuals&rsquo; ancestors and lineage, allowing scholars to make claims, for example, about the number of Roman officials from the same small network of families <sup id="fnref2:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The standardized, statistical nature of prosopography makes it a natural fit for computational research. Addressing concerns that prosopographical templates can decontextualize information about a person, presenting it as a straightforward fact, beginning in the 1990s scholars including John Bradley and Harold Short developed a factoid-based approach to prosopography, which uses relational technology to link person records to information about people in primary sources <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. This approach positions prosopography as a collection of situated factoids with potential tensions or contradictions, rather than as a standalone  “‘scholarly overview’ of a person”   <sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Recent work has focused on how to make prosopographical data more widely discoverable online. The question of how to integrate prosopography with the semantic web has spurred scholars to explore ontologies such as CIDOC-CRM, FOAF, and SKOS <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>, and to work with TEI and MARC authority records with the goal of making prosopographical data interoperable with library catalogues <sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Our contribution to digital prosopography begins at the opposite end of the research process, with developing an inclusive research method for collecting prosopographical data that leverages a combination of scholarly tools and databases aimed at family historians. This method grows out of our project’s user orientation, which has led us to prioritize actions that increase the availability of users’ information interactions within our digital edition. Our use of genealogical databases does not focus on uncovering family networks, which are not currently part of our TEI tagset, but rather on researching obscure people, particularly women and the working classes, who would otherwise be lost to history. Prosopography is notoriously labor-intensive; a problem with prosopographical research has been that the sources needed to complete research on a group of people, for example, the social background of a group of geographically-diverse Oxford students in the 1950s, has been scattered across the United Kingdom <sup id="fnref3:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Discovery services developed over the last thirty years and aimed at family historians, such as  <em>Ancestry</em>  or  <em>FindMyPast</em> , offer a solution to this problem by aggregating not only previously scattered parish baptismal, birth, death and census records, but also, more recently, data including asylum records, military records, and even dog registration records.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Leveraging family history databases would seem to be a straightforward solution to some of the difficulties of prosopographical research, but scholars tend to be suspicious of resources aimed at family historians.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>  Tanya Evans writes that genealogists  “have been dismissed by professional and academic historians&hellip; as ‘misty-eyed and syrupy’ and their findings and practices deemed irrelevant to the wider historical community”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. This suspicion operates at an institutional level; public libraries are much more likely to offer subscriptions to genealogical databases than university libraries. Marianne Van Remoortel notes that because these databases  “primarily target amateur genealogists and do not count many universities among their subscribers, their potential remains largely untapped”   <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. This concern is part of a long tradition of suspicion in the academy toward those who do research without the training and credentials valued in the university. N. Katherine Hayles writes that  “most professional fields in the humanities have their shadow fields,”  and that scholars  “often regard such activity as a nuisance because it is not concerned with the questions the scholar regards as important or significant”   <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Following Hayles, we demonstrate that scholars would do well to incorporate the expertise and digital tools developed by and for those outside the academy.</p>
<p>Prosopography is a central component of editing correspondence, but often historical persons mentioned in letters are researched with varying levels of detail depending upon their perceived historical significance.  <em>Digital Dinah Craik</em>  offers a case study that shows what a TEI prosopography might look like when a project’s research practices disallow such selective value judgments. Three digital editions of nineteenth-century letters —  <em>The Letters of Charlotte Mary Yonge</em>   <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>,  <em>The Olive Schreiner Letters Online</em>   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>, and the TEI edition of the  <em>Vincent Van Gogh Letters</em>   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> — differ in the level of granularity with which they encode the correspondents and people mentioned in the letters. The  <em>Vincent Van Gogh Letters</em>  give full name dates of birth and death and occupation for all persons mentioned and typically no more (though there are separate written essays detailing Van Gogh’s family).  <em>The Charlotte Yonge Letters</em>  give a full name, date of birth and death, a description including either occupation or relationship to Yonge, and a short biographical sentence for those named in the letters.  <em>The Olive Schreiner Letters</em>  write their prosopographical data in paragraphs, with differing levels of detail. For example, a Miss Battie is described as  “a typist who Schreiner approached to type some of her manuscripts”  about whom no further information is known <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>, while the actor Wilson Barrett is described in a full paragraph with suggestions for further reading <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Our research practice takes our prosopography in a different direction than these editions of correspondence, in that we aim to fill out a template for historical people in the letters whether Craik mentions them by name or by reference. In the following section, we offer three case studies of the research methods used to uncover information about the lives of nineteenth-century women. We demonstrate how we disambiguated two of Craik’s servants, referred to as Mary and Little Mary in the letters, uncovered a woman referred to only as Henry Blackett’s sister, and connected a woman author referred to as Miss Blyth to her pseudonym, May Beverley. We enter into this level of detail with the dual goal of providing an example of how we have combined scholarly and para-scholarly information resources to gather the most detail possible for every  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry, and the feminist aim of making the labor of the student research assistants who gathered this data visible.</p>
<h2 id="encoding-nineteenth-century-women-harriet-blackett-mary-popham-blyth-mary-bonnar-and-mary-chandler">Encoding Nineteenth-Century Women: Harriet Blackett, Mary Popham Blyth, Mary Bonnar, and Mary Chandler</h2>
<p>Prosopography has an important role to play in our assessment of women’s careers, since the networks of writers, artists, editors and publishers that supported a career like Craik’s did not have the same public visibility as those of her male contemporaries. While many early digital humanities projects cast a wide net, considering the texts and lives of hundreds of women writers, focusing on one individual woman writers’ connections has the potential to reveal a detailed, historically situated network of literary sociability. As Elisa Beshero-Bondar and Elizabeth Raisanen argue, while many digital humanities projects tend to consider women writers collectively, doing so may elide the historical specificity and idiosyncrasies of particular women writers; we can seek to redress this problem in part by launching projects devoted to single women writers, like Mary Russell Mitford, the subject of Beshero-Bondar and Raisanen’s work <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. As we will show, these egocentric networks have the potential to uncover detailed, situated, and inclusive historical networks in addition to building a prosopographical database that  “alters one’s attention to individuals, blurring historical or textual specificity”   <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Although Craik remains the thread that connects all the people in our prosopography, the very work of building a prosopographical TEI file distributes our attention across communities.</p>
<p>The initial TEI structure for our prosopography, a separate file with a  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  template for every person named or mentioned in Craik’s letters, was modelled after  <em>Digital Mitford</em> , which takes on a similar level of granularity in prosopographical encoding <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. Each  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry is assigned an  <code>@xml:id</code>  (we use LastnameFirstname) then, we endeavour to also include a full  <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>  ( <code>&lt;surname&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;forename&gt;</code> ), assigned  <code>@sex</code> , date of  <code>&lt;birth&gt;</code> , and date of  <code>&lt;death&gt;</code> , as well as a short biographical  <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> . Our project includes further sections for the census categories  <code>&lt;occupation&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;nationality&gt;</code> . As an example, see the  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry for Craik’s close friend, Minna Lovell (see Figure 1). At the time of writing, our personography contains 989 person entries focusing on historical people mentioned in the letters, with further entries for pets and fictional people. Digitized civil records such as historical census and probates have become essential to our practice of inclusive digital prosopography; we have also found that the genealogical databases through which we access these records can afford new areas of inquiry into our project’s dataset.</p>

<p>Our adoption of a strict set of prosopographical tags has led us to diversify our data and develop more inclusive approaches to information seeking. Every time that a name is mentioned in a transcribed letter, we tag it with a  <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>  and use a  <code>@ref</code>  attribute to point the element to  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry with an  <code>@xml:id</code>  in our prosopography. We do the same with a  <code>&lt;rs&gt;</code>  or referencing string when people who are mentioned but not named (e.g. his wife). Then, no matter how minor the reference, we try to complete each element in our template. In order to research people like Craik’s fellow lodger, whose forename may have been either May or Marian and whose surname may have been either James or Anderson, we turn to genealogical sources such as  “FamilySearch.com”  and  <em>Ancestry.com</em> , which digitize census data, birth and death certificates, marriage certificates, and probates, among other records. These primary sources can help us to provide the full names, life ranges, nationalities, occupations, and often the residences for many of the unknown people from Craik’s letters. Usually, knowing the few facts provided in a census report such as full name, occupation, and nationality, helps us to reformulate our previous searches. Having more robust search terms helps us to find more information about otherwise unknown lives in newspaper databases such as the  <em>British Newspaper Archive</em>  and in optical character recognition (OCR) generated transcripts of nineteenth-century  <em>Google Books</em> .</p>
<p>The structure of our TEI prosopography protocols discourages and even disallows our instinctive value judgments about who counts in a collective biography. For example, Craik’s two servants, whom she calls Mary and Little Mary exemplify the working-class women’s lives that, as Virginia Woolf notes, were excluded from the original  “DNB” , yet both merit  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entries in our project’s prosopography. Because we knew relatively little about the two Marys, and because Craik omits both women’s surnames in her letters, we used the names that Craik used to refer to them as their @xml:id values. Then, we turned to genealogical databases seeking information that would help us to populate the elements in our TEI tagset. Internal evidence from Craik’s letters assured us that we could disambiguate between the two Marys by tracing the residents of Craik’s household through mid-century census records. Craik writes about both servants in a letter to her brother in 1860, in which she details a domestic revolution in her home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday night or rather Thursday morng [morning] came the grand domestic crash – found out unfortunate Mary in drinking – stealing – lying. – I had taken the baby, – &amp; nearly clothed her &amp; it too – these 4 months – got her nursed thro’ her bad illness – &amp;c. &amp;c. – All no good – she is thoroughly depraved. Your instinct was right &amp; my pity wrong. – I got her out of the house as soon as I could. &amp; little Mary came up at an hour’s notice. A great blessing. <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the census of 1861 — one year after this dramatic story of alcoholism and unwed pregnancy — the Craik household at Wildwood in Hampstead lists two servants: Mary Chandler, age 23, and Mary Bonnar, age 13 <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>. We verified our assumption that the younger Mary was Little Mary by looking into Craik’s servants beyond the year 1861. Mary Bonnar stayed with Craik for the next decade and is listed as a servant at Dinah and George Craik’s residence, the Corner House, in 1871 <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. We filled in the rest of Mary Chandler’s and Mary Bonnar’s  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entries using the records available to us through genealogical databases. Craik was known in her career for writing about the relationships between gentlewomen and their female servants, in her novel,  <em>Mistress and Maid</em>   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> and essays  <em>A Woman’s Thoughts about Women</em>   <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Her letters, and accompanying prosopography, give us a glimpse into the sometimes dramatic lives of the servants with whom Craik was on such intimate terms.</p>
<p>Our practice of encoding unnamed people in Craik’s letters with a referencing string, a  <code>@type</code>  attribute with the value person, and a  <code>@ref</code>  attribute propels our research team to seek out all the obscure, singular mentions of people that one might choose to leave out of a codex edition or even another digital edition. Moreover, our use of this tag has revealed new information needs, as it populates our prosopography with marginal figures and has catalyzed our move toward para-scholarly information resources. Overall, we have found that the  <code>&lt;rs&gt;</code>  tag prompts us to politicise our prosopographical research as we create space in our prosopography for the frequently unnamed wives, daughters, and sisters whose private labor supported public-oriented men. For example, in the letter cited above, Craik writes that Thomas Hughes — author of  <em>Tom Brown’s School Days</em>  (1857) — and his wife would be joining her for early tea <sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. At the mention of his wife, we created an  <code>@xml:id</code>  with a placeholder value MrsHughes. Recently digitized birth certificates, death certificates, and census material helped us to create a full prosopographical entry for Anne Frances Hughes, including an updated  <code>xml:id</code> , and one which occupies equal space to the account of her husband’s life.</p>

<p>Our workflow for the  <code>&lt;rs&gt;</code>  tag often leads to complex prosopographical research requiring a greater diversity of genealogical and other information resources. In October 1860, Craik wrote to her brother Benjamin Mulock that her friend and publisher Henry Blackett was in the midst of familial troubles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Blackett was here last night – &amp; told me his woes. His sister has fallen into a low way – &amp; he fears he must put her in an Asylum – but means to take her to live with him first, &amp; try what he can do. – He has terrible health himself, poor man – He is a worthy sort. I wouldn&rsquo;t leave him. <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When encoding this passage, we used a  <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>  tag on the name Henry Blackett and pointed it toward a  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry in the Craik Site Index with the  <code>@xml:id</code>  value, BlackettHenry. We encoded the words His sister with a  <code>&lt;rs&gt;</code>  referencing string and a  <code>@type</code>  attribute with the value person. This tag pointed toward a draft  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry with the  <code>@xml:id</code>  value MissBlackett. Information about the lives of historical men, even those who made a major impact on the publishing industry, can also sometimes be scarce. Henry Blackett — one of the founding members of the London-based publishing firm Hurst and Blackett — does not have an entry in the  <em>ODNB</em> , but his status as one of the most well-established publishers in the era enabled us to piece together his biographical details from a combination of census records, writers’ biographies, and monographs on Victorian publishing.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p>

<p>Scholarly sources offer scarce details about Henry Blackett’s family and personal life; as such, our research into his sister’s life depended upon the robust research affordances of para-scholarly information retrieval services. To begin filling out the  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry for his sister, we located Henry Blackett’s early census records on  <em>Ancestry.com</em> . In this case, we used information from the Craik Site Index, but we find that low-barrier digital sources such as  <em>Wikipedia</em>  often provide enough information to begin an effective search on genealogical platforms. Using Henry Blackett’s birth and death dates and his place of birth, we searched British census records, focusing on the first two decades of his life, when he might have lived with his parents and siblings. The census for 1851 shows a 25-year-old Henry Blackett living at 16 Bedford Row, Islington, Middlesex with his widowed mother Martha, his three younger sisters, two visitors (his future wife and mother-in-law), and two servants. This step narrowed our search to one among three Blackett sisters: Martha (b. 23 August 1822), Harriet (b. 2 March 1829), or Catherine (b. 30 June 1831) (Census 1851). It also helped build a basic TEI template and stub entries for the Blacketts, which could help us to verify that all of our future searches pertained to the same Blackett family. Next, we searched for Henry Blackett’s household data around the time that Craik was writing about his sister’s declining mental health. In April 1861, less than six months after Craik composed her letter, Henry Blackett lived at Westside, Ealing, Middlesex with his wife Ellen, his five children, and his sister, Harriet <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. In this census report, Harriet was not listed as a visitor, but as a resident of Henry Blackett’s household.</p>
<p>The governmental records aggregated by genealogical databases provided us with adequate information to build a prosopographical record for Harriet Blackett, an otherwise obscure figure in British literary history. However, we were ultimately unable to provide a precise date of death of Harriet Blackett. In March 1864, she married a man named Joseph James and adopted the much more common name Harriet James. Without a middle name on record, we have been unable to discern between the many Harriet Jameses in the Church of England Burial Records and the Civil Registration Death Indexes. Harriet James’s name does not appear in any digitized probates. A search into recently digitized Victorian asylum records did not yield results at the time of writing, but may in the future as more of these records are digitized as part of the Lunacy Patient Admission Registers on  <em>Ancestry</em>  and other platforms. To accommodate this gap in our research, we included the attribute  <code>@notBefore=&quot;1881-04-03&quot;</code>  to indicate that Harriet (Blackett) James was still alive at the time of the 1881 census.</p>

<p>Our prosopographical template affords a flexible way of encoding the multiple name changes that marked some nineteenth century women’s lives. A final example illustrates the complexities that enter prosopographical research when an author uses a variety of names — including a maiden name, married name, and pen name — throughout her lifetime. In four letters that Craik wrote to the publisher Alexander Macmillan in 1860, she makes passing reference to a young writer named Miss Blyth, who was attempting to publish one of her novels with Macmillan and Company. These four letters, housed in the Berg collection at the New York Public Library, were all composed when Craik was working as a publisher’s reader for Macmillan and Company. As such, Craik’s letters to Macmillan detail her opinions on the promise and publishability of the work under review. Craik’s opinion of the young writer was generally favourable. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a wonderful deal in this Miss Blyth. – I don’t like strongly to advise for this tale – and yet I should be sorry for you to miss it. – I wonder if when done she will submit to a solid hard criticism &amp; condensation It might be made a very very nice book – if gone over again. I am sure. – <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After revision, Craik declares the novel satisfactory and concludes that  “the strong clear hand with which she has corrected and re-ended it – shows me more than ever how good a writer she will become. – ”   <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Creating a prosopographical entry for Miss Blyth proved challenging: with nothing but a common British surname to begin our research, we had to amalgamate data from a mix of scholarly and para-scholarly information resources before we could initiate a query in genealogical databases. Because Craik mentions Miss Blyth with proper names throughout the Berg letters, we encoded all instances with the  <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>  tag and created an  <code>@xml:id</code>  for MissBlyth in our Craik Site Index. We added a  <code>@ref</code>  attribute to the original  <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>  tags and pointed them to the  <code>@xml:id</code> . Open-source digitization projects such as  <em>Google Books</em>  and the  <em>Internet Archive</em>  were essential for initiating a prosopographical record for Miss Blyth. Instead of working with the sparse biographical information and common surname that we had on hand, we started a search profile by uncovering the manuscript she was working on with Macmillan and Company in 1860. Craik’s letters reveal that Miss Blyth’s manuscript was entitled  <em>Aunt Jessie</em>   <sup id="fnref1:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> and included characters named Herbert, Mabel, Millicent, and Jackson <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Two characters named M &amp; J were engaged in courtship <sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Craik’s reflections on Miss Blyth and her manuscript gave us further insight into the subject matter. On  <em>Aunt Jessie</em> , Craik writes that  “the Crimea life is as fresh &amp; natural-like as if she had seen it – she must have got it from nature, secondhand: as I got from Ben – ”   <sup id="fnref2:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. Furthermore, Craik’s first response to  <em>Aunt Jessie</em>  was  “it garred me greet”   <sup id="fnref3:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> — a Scottish colloquialism which roughly means  “compelled me greatly”   <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. The latter of these two details puzzled us: Macmillan was Scottish, and Craik might have been dipping into colloquialisms as a form of amicability, but, it was also possible that either the writer or the content of  <em>Aunt Jessie</em>  was Scottish. With these details in mind, we began our search for titles similar to  <em>Aunt Jessie</em>  that were published in the latter portion of 1860 — hoping, of course, that Macmillan heeded Craik’s advice to publish the tale.</p>
<p>To create a prosopographical entry for an unknown writer like Miss Blyth, we had to adopt an inclusive and iterative research process, combining fragments from public and academic information resources including  <em>Google Books</em> , the  <em>Internet Archive</em> , newspaper, scholarly, and eventually, genealogical databases. Just as we expected, searches in  <em>The Orlando Project</em>  and elsewhere retrieved many writers named Blyth, including Estelle Blyth, Myrna Blyth, E. H. Blyth, and Sophie Veitch, a Scotswoman and sensation novelist  “who lived the early part of her life abroad,”  wrote travel books in the 1860s, and sometimes used the pseudonym J. A. St John Blythe  <sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Eventually, we found a novel on  <em>Google Books</em>  called  <em>The Moor Cottage</em> , published by Macmillan and Company in 1861 <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>. By conducting free text searches in this novel, we found a main character named Aunt Jessie with secondary characters named Herbert, Mabel, Millicent, and Jackson. We verified that this novel featured the Crimean War, and found that the plot included a romance that confirmed Craik’s comments praising the  “lovemaking between Millicent &amp; Jackson”   <sup id="fnref4:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>.  <em>The Moor Cottage</em>  was authored by a writer named May Beverley; yet, our prosopography entry in progress indicated that this person might have shared an identity with Miss Blyth. While researching May Beverley, we found that she published books for young readers between 1859 and 1871, including  <em>Little Estella and Other Fairy Tales</em>  with Macmillan in 1859. We had trouble connecting this author with the name Blyth until we found an 1874 advertisement for May Beverley’s  <em>The City of the Plain, and other Tales</em>  edited by Reverend E. H. Blyth, Hammersmith <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As our example of Miss Blyth demonstrates, an openness toward combining diverse scholarly and para-scholarly information resources can afford more inclusive representations of marginalized figures in prosopographical research. After learning the name of May Beverley’s one-time editor Reverend E. H. Blyth, we learned that Blyth had a sister who shared his literary inclinations. Mary Popham Blyth is listed in the personography of Troy J. Bassett’s  <em>At the Circulating Library: A Database of Victorian Fiction 1837–1901</em>   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. She was born in Beverley, Yorkshire <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. May Beverley, then, was a pseudonym that combined a diminutive of Mary Blyth’s forename with her place of birth. As we researched her career, we learned that Mary Popham Blyth wrote under both her given name, her initials M. P. B., and her pseudonym from the years 1859 to 1871. She was also an amateur artist whose works appeared in the India Office Library <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>. After connecting the pseudonym to the author mentioned in the letter, we were able to fill in the tags required by our TEI prosopography. The profile on Troy J. Bassett’s  <em>At the Circulating Library</em>  catalyzed our  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry for the  <code>xml:id</code>  Miss Blyth, but we verified the information with sources such as  <em>Ancestry.com</em> ,  <em>Familysearch.com</em> ,  <em>Google Books</em> , and the  <em>Internet Archive</em> . Census records helped us correct her birth year from 1831 to 1841, while also adding key information such as  <code>&lt;occupation&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;nationality&gt;</code> . Our  <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>  was populated with information from Craik’s letters and includes biographical information that centres around her relationship to Craik.</p>

<p>Our research does not always yield such certainty over the identity of a person, and we find that it is important to be able to encode for levels of certainty in identifying prosopographical subjects. Publishing was often a family business in the nineteenth century, and in the case of Craik’s first publishers, Chapman and Hall, we are not always certain whether letters addressed to Mr. Chapman were meant to reach Edward Chapman, founder of the firm, or his cousin, Frederic Chapman, who took on major responsibilities at the firm following Hall’s death in 1847 <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. In these cases, we make use of the TEI’s certainty attribute ( <code>@cert</code> ) with a low,  medium or high attribute value to qualify the degrees of certainty in interpretative encoding. For example, in a letter that Craik wrote between the 6th and 7th of December 1855, she recounts the contents of her recent mail to her brother, Ben. Craik writes that she received  “a box of good things from an Aunt of the Pmalderites a nice old lady who promised me shortbread &amp; I don’t know what &amp; sent a box-full”   <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. Based on what we already know about Craik’s social networks, we inferred that the Pmalderites was a reference to the family of Craik’s friend Allan Park Paton — a Scottish writer and editor whom Craik often visited at his dwelling, Pmalder Cottage, in Greenock. However, the letter did not produce adequate leads to follow up on our suspicions. Like most genealogical research, our prosopographical research can be an endless back-and-forth process of consulting multiple digital platforms and analogue materials, and unfortunately, it does not always yield successful results.</p>
<p>Our difficulties in identifying historic people are further compounded by working with unclear handwritten manuscript materials. Proper names can be challenging to work with; place and person names are among the most difficult words for a twenty-first century researcher to read accurately. Whereas the original recipient of the letter was embedded in the same social network as the letter writer, the twenty-first century reader must rely on a knowledge of the sender’s handwriting and its peculiarities as well as a general sense of common surnames in nineteenth-century England to make an educated guess as to what the proper name might be. There has been research into proper names using prosopography; omnastics has, for example, identified common slave names in ancient Rome <sup id="fnref4:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Our research problem again begins with developing the prosopography in the first place rather than analyzing a completed dataset, and with paleography rather than omnastics. Put simply, how should a researcher develop a  <code>&lt;person&gt;</code>  entry for a name they cannot read? Again, a wide search encompassing a range of sources can help. While it was not at first apparent to us whether a person who appeared to be Craik’s neighbor was named Miss Wilkinson or Miss Wilkensen or something else altogether; genealogical records reveal that a Sarah Wilkinson was a neighbor of Craik’s, and newspaper articles surrounding Craik’s adoption of a daughter and neighbor Miss Wilkinson’s involvement confirm the reading. As the example of Miss Wilkinson shows, addresses, a key component of correspondence, can clarify a person’s identity when all else fails.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of mobility and propinquity in Craik’s career led us to change our initial template and adopt a  <code>&lt;residence&gt;</code>  tag in our TEI prosopography. The  <code>&lt;residence&gt;</code>  tag is useful in terms of clarifying both identity and temporal location: it can clarify both the identity of those referred to in a letter and the date of the letter. Because nineteenth-century census information was collected door-to-door, address information for historical subjects is also available in genealogical databases. In combination with datable w3c attributes  <code>@from</code>  and  <code>@to</code>  or  <code>@notBefore</code>  and  <code>@notAfter</code> , we have begun to use the  <code>&lt;residence&gt;</code>  tag to track the addresses of Craik’s closest friends, colleagues, and collaborators. Developing a list of Craik’s residences and the timeframe that she lived there as part of her prosopographical entry helps us to narrow down dates for letters with no dateline; frequently, her letters will include an address so that the recipient would know where to write back, but a partial dateline that is missing the year or is absent altogether, since the recipient would have presumably known what year it was. We have also included residences for Craik’s close friends and associates, since it is not uncommon for her to write a letter from a friend’s residence, or to refer within a letter to a friend by residence or street name. When a letter is addressed from 1 Doune Terrace, we can infer that Craik was visiting the publisher Robert Chambers in Edinburgh when it was written. Sometimes, as in the case of the reference to the Pmalderites, Craik will refer to a family by their residence. For example, on Christmas Eve in 1886, Craik records in her diary  “Went to Eden Cottage to see the family collection of babies — a very sweet sight — to the delight of grandparents — parents — uncles &amp; aunts.”  The residence tag in our prosopography allows us to quickly determine that the Miers family, close friends and neighbors of Craik’s with connections to Brazil, lived at Eden Cottage. The addition of the  <code>&lt;residence&gt;</code>  tag, which disambiguates dates and people, is thus especially useful for new members of the project as it creates an accessible internal reference. It has also provided the basis for further research into geolocating Victorian residences in order to explore the role of propinquity — frequent, unplanned interaction due to physical proximity — in women writers’s careers.</p>
<p>Not all proper names have proven tractable to these research methods. Although the structure of our TEI prosopography drives us to completion, there are cases when we cannot complete an entry, and the TEI is flexible enough to allow for these instances. In some cases, entries remain incomplete because of our workflow: it may be practical to research an obscure person at a later date and instead focus on completing a transcription of a long letter. A lack of information may also prevent completion. Sometimes, searching a genealogical database with nothing but the fact that someone with the surname Linos helped Craik to organize a small glee club around the year 1862 is not enough to work with. In such cases, we create and use stub entries, which may be as simple as whichever part of a name is mentioned in a letter (first names in case of servants or intimate friends, last names in case of middle-class friends, acquaintances and professional connections), plus an  <code>@xml:id</code>  and gender attribute. If more information arises, these stub entries can be fleshed out at a later date. Nevertheless, the number of lives we have been able to uncover by using all sources available to us, regardless of their perceived scholarly value, has been illuminating.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-communities-of-practice">Conclusion: Communities of Practice</h2>
<p>Current digital research methods are shifting the boundaries around whose labor, methods, expertise, and tools can be included in definitions of scholarship. In our work on  <em>Digital Dinah Craik</em> , we embrace this shift as we develop an inclusive and situated practice of digital prosopography designed to aid the users of our digital edition in their engagements with Craik’s encoded correspondence. Combining the scholarly editorial practices set out by the TEI with genealogical databases and other para-scholarly resources has led us to a research methodology that takes full advantage of the digital resources that are available to us at this historical moment. Inclusivity is at the helm of our research practice; it drives our methods for populating the TEI prosopography with marginalized lives from Craik’s correspondence, and it propels us toward diverse research methods for completing our TEI tagsets. Our research team uses and acknowledges our debt to a range of scholarly and para-scholarly information resources for prosopography, many of which have been designed for researchers who work outside of the institutional structures of the university, and in the shadow fields of the academy <sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Genealogical databases such as  <em>Ancestry</em>  and  <em>FamilySearch</em>  and mass digitization projects like  <em>Google Books</em> , the  <em>Internet Archive</em> , and the  <em>British Newspaper Archive</em>  have long served the information needs of public researchers, both hobbyists and professionals. Originally, these para-scholarly resources fulfilled our project’s needs where traditional scholarly databases have fallen short, and they have gradually become paramount to the success of our prosopographical method. In short, where in the past many of these lives would have been glossed over in edited letters, the combination of the TEI and genealogical resources allows us to pause and expand our understanding of Craik’s networks to include women like Harriet Blackett, Mary Popham Blyth, Mary Bonnar, and Mary Chandler. It is our hope that our prosopography, which traces the lives of everyone mentioned in one author’s correspondence, serves to shed some light on lives that often go unremarked.</p>
<p>To conclude, we would also like to suggest that a more inclusive research process has the potential to build a wider community of practice. Our work on the  <em>Digital Dinah Craik</em>  prosopography has led our project team to open our research communities as well as our research practices. Our approach, method, and practice of digital prosopography developed from sustained interactions among project members with a variety of community research experiences. Our project is situated in a traditional academic setting, with work taking place in the university library before the COVID-19 pandemic. It began as a collaboration among academic researchers (one professor with a small team of graduate and undergraduate students), and it has been shaped by lessons learned among genealogy collectives at the local public library. Over time, academic librarians, including Christie Hurrell and Ingrid Reiche, public library staff, especially Janice Parker, and local genealogists, including Alyson Bennett, have contributed to  <em>Digital Dinah Craik</em> , often importing techniques and sources from their own communities of practice. Our use of genealogical databases in particular draws on the expertise of those with a background working in the public library system. We would suggest that one larger outcome of utilizing a diverse range of scholarly and para-scholarly sources is the ability to build a more diverse community of practice that incorporates knowledge and expertise from outside of the academy.</p>

<p>As of March 2019, using the advanced search function available in the online edition, we find 6,974 notable women to the 54,011 notable men. If we limit our search to the long nineteenth century (1789 to 1914), women fare marginally better, making up 14% (rather than 13%) of notable people (4,698 women and 30,135 men). Other scholars have noticed this issue and the  <em>ODNB</em>  is working to rectify the situation. See Alison Booth,  “Fighting for Lives in the  <em>ODNB</em> ,”  for an overview of the problem of the lack of representation of women and the working classes at the time of the launch of the online  <em>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</em>  in 2004.

Introduction</h2>
<p>The act of comparing textual versions has always been central to textual criticism and manuscript research. The importance of this type of collation has only increased in the digital age. Most scholarly editors no longer produce collations by hand; they use the output generated by software, either as is, or as the starting point for manual correction. Still, in more complex cases such as manuscripts with revisions – i.e., textual variation within one text version – it remains difficult to have the collation software produce a result that corresponds with what a scholarly editor would produce. The reason for this is, simply put, that the collation software treats the input as linear text, whereas text with revisions is not completely linear. As a consequence, scholarly editors still need to do quite some manual work, such as preparing the input texts or adjusting the collation output. What is more, they lose information about the multilayered nature of the document and the physical traces of the writing process or transmission history.</p>
<p>We therefore set out to create collation software that is able to compare texts with revisions. When working on this challenge, we soon realized that conveying our human interpretation of text with revisions to the computer is not merely a technical matter. It is, in fact, deeply rooted in philological questions: what do we understand by text with revisions? What type of revisions can we discern? And how do we expect the collation software to deal with them? Designing and developing a collation tool that understands in-text variation in a way similar to how scholarly editors understand it requires us to formalize our understanding of in-text variation. We argue that in-text variation can best be modelled as nonlinear text, and that a collation tool needs to treat this nonlinear text differently from the way linear text is treated. This will produce a more refined collation output that corresponds with a human interpretation of the textual variance.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, we focus on in-text variation resulting from authorial revisions on modern manuscripts; revisions by multiple textual agents are not within the scope of this article. As a test-corpus we took small examples from a modern manuscript of Samuel Beckett featuring numerous deletions and additions that Beckett made at various stages in the writing process.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  Evidently, the feature of in-text variation is not unique to modern manuscripts: medieval and older manuscripts often contain indistinguishable layers of in-text revisions as well. When in-text revisions are made with the same writing tool they cannot be easily divided into separate revision campaigns. The challenges of automatically collating such multi-layered texts are, then, twofold: first, to adequately process a textual version that contains one or more revisions, and second, to return a collation output that corresponds with what a scholarly editor would intuitively produce. We will discuss our approach to these challenges in the context of HyperCollate, an automatic collation tool developed to take in-text revisions into account when calculating the best match between two textual versions.</p>
<p><a href="#section2">Section 2</a> provides a theoretical background for the concepts and practices under discussion: versions, witnesses, in-text revision, and (non)linear text. It also provides a brief overview of the existing approaches to collating texts with in-text variation. <a href="#section3">Section 3</a> presents the collation tool HyperCollate. We describe its underlying data model – a hypergraph for textual variation – and how this data model differs from XML tree structures and regular variant graphs. A hypergraph for textual variation offers more flexibility in storing and processing information that is relevant to the study of textual variance. Subsequently, we single out two instances of in-text variation that occur frequently in manuscript texts – single deletions or additions and substitutions – and we describe for each type of variation what we, as human scholars, expect of the collation output (<a href="#section3-2">section 3.2</a>). How do we wantt the collation tool to handle immediate revisions in a textual version? What do we expect to see in the output? The answer to such questions, i.e., our expectations, inform the rules for the collation program. HyperCollate’s performance with each type of variation is discussed in <a href="#section3-3">section 3.3</a>. The evaluation (<a href="#section3-4">section 3.4</a>) includes the question of visualization, as existing visualizations could turn out to be inadequate in displaying the additional information in an insightful way. <a href="#section4">Section 4</a>, finally, discusses a number of areas in need of further research.</p>
<p>As the development and use of collation tools requires us to clearly articulate what we understand by textual variation and what we expect from the collation, automated collation tools can provide us with a heightened awareness of, and confront us with our assumptions about, the notion of text. The workflow of a scholarly editor using an automated collation tool consists of seemingly straightforward steps (transcription ⇒ collation ⇒ visualization) but each step implies decision-making at several stages and substages (selection, tagging, tokenization, normalization, a definition of a match, etc.). The decisions made at one stage influence the outcome of a subsequent stage. Recognizing and understanding this heuristic process will prompt us to rethink our theories of text (cf. <a href="#ciula2014">Ciula and Eide 2014, 36</a>) and how these theories correspond to the workings of a text analysis tool.</p>
<p>By demonstrating, first, how we made our human definition of in-text variation computer-understandable and, subsequently, how this definition influences the operations as well as the results of a collation tool, we hope to provide our readers with a deeper understanding of the process of modeling textual variation. We intend to show how the development of a collation program has both a philological and a computational perspective. Accordingly, our study reflects a fruitful collaboration between textual scholars and software architects: their respective knowledge is essential in order to successfully store, process, and analyse text. It thus proves a worthy partnership for manuscript research and modelling textual variance.</p>
<h2 id="2-theoretical-and-methodological-background">2. Theoretical and Methodological Background</h2>
<p>In what follows we give an overview of the discussion around textual versions and witnesses (section 2.1), of the challenges of transcribing and modeling in-text variation (section 2.2 and 2.3), and of the current approaches to collating texts with internal revisions (section 2.4).</p>
<h2 id="21-text-work-versions-witnesses-and-in-text-revision">2.1. Text, Work, Versions, Witnesses, and In-text Revision</h2>
<p>A few working definitions of the terms document,  version,  witness,  work, and text are in order. Following Peter Shillingsburg, we define a document as the  “physical vessel”  that carries information <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. A version has  “no substantial existence”  as Shillingsburg puts it <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. As a theoretical construct, it implies that there are at least two textual representations of the work. A witness is a  “written document that witnesses a text’s genesis”  according to Almuth Grésillon <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  A witness is therefore a physical object. Whereas the term document considers the object in and of itself, the term witness considers it in relation to a work. Different documents that relate to the same work are witnesses of it. According to Siegfried Scheibe,  “Textual versions are achieved or unachieved elaborations of the text that diverge from one another. They are related through textual identity and distinct through variation.”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. In principle, this implies that a single revision suffices to speak of two versions, or as Hans Zeller noted:  “In the most extreme case a version is constituted by a single variant. A holograph with one alteration which does not simply correct an error thus represents two versions of the text”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. The notion of the work is used in the sense of the  “experience implied by the authoritative versions of literary writing”   <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, a non-material concept that  “serves as a minimal denominator to identify its remaining physical manifestations”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. In the context of this article, the term text will be employed to indicate not so much  “the text of the work,”  but  “the text of the document,”  that is, the sequence of marks present in one particular document <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In textual scholarship, the notion of version,  textual version or Textfassung usually implies the entirety of a work, as in Peter Shillingsburg’s definition:  “A version is one specific form of the work – the one the author intended at some particular moment in time”   <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The problem, however, is that this moment in time is hard to define. If the work is a long novel, it takes a while for an author to revise the entire manuscript or to proofread the page proofs. The revision may consist of more than one phase, or more than one revision campaign (campagne de révision). There may be only two versions of the opening chapter, but a dozen versions of the closing chapter. Moreover, the unit of revision may vary considerably. Some writers’ preferred writing unit is a chapter, others tend to work and think in terms of paragraphs.</p>
<p>This reality makes it difficult to establish a general rule on which we can base the collation algorithm. For the purposes of this article, we work with the sentence as a relatively small unit of revision. Our examples are based on the manuscripts of Samuel Beckett and the transcriptions in the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP).<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>  These documents constitute what is usually referred to as “modern” manuscripts, to distinguish these autographs from ancient and medieval manuscripts, many of which were produced by scribes. Indeed the majority of medieval manuscripts are copies and not autographs, but that does not mean that all medieval manuscripts are copies. Medieval autographs do exist, and it is perfectly possible to apply automatic collation to them. Instead of using the term modern manuscripts we will therefore speak of manuscripts with revisions or even more generally of texts with revisions.  In-text implies that we focus on textual variation within one version of a text.</p>
<h2 id="22-transcribing-linearity-and-nonlinearity">2.2. Transcribing Linearity and Nonlinearity</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, studying manuscripts with revisions is intrinsically linked to the act of linearizing text. Even when we read a text, we mentally arrange the characters in a linear order; vertically or horizontally, from left to right or vice versa, depending on the language. This perhaps subconscious act of linearization is more striking when we make a transcription of a complex text with revisions. Since the goal of a transcription is, in the first place, to render a text more readable, linearizing the text on the document is desirable – but not without cost. Texts with revisions contain traces of a writing process over time; so when words and characters are placed in a linear order, the manuscript page loses that diachronic aspect. The desire to preserve the nonlinear nature of the text coupled with the need to make it readable (and processable) confronts textual scholars with a dilemma. Accordingly, linearization has been the topic of long debates in genetic criticism and textual scholarship <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. The flattening or de-manuscripting of a text is generally accepted as a necessary evil, although it is lamented that the most typical feature of a written draft – its nonlinearity – is reduced to a straightforward sequence of text.</p>
<p>In print, nonlinear text can be indicated with certain diacritical marks or forms of layout; in digital transcriptions the revisions can be captured with markup elements and visualized with HTML and/or CSS.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  The TEI Guidelines suggest two ways of expressing an instance of nonlinear text: substitutions can be recorded (1) by means of a  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  element grouping one or more  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  elements,<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  or (2) by means of an  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>  element containing two or more  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  elements.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>In both cases, a human encoder will think of these TEI elements as indicating the momentary suspension of the linear sequence of text characters. The text stream runs from left to right, diverges at the points where variation occurs (indicated with an open tag  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  or  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> ) and converges when the variation ends (indicated with a closing tag  <code>&lt;/subst&gt;</code>  or  <code>&lt;/app&gt;</code> ). We can say that there are multiple coexisting, simultaneous paths through the text. The start of each path is marked with a  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> , an  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> , or a  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  element; the end of each path with the corresponding  <code>&lt;/del&gt;</code> ,  <code>&lt;/add&gt;</code> , or  <code>&lt;/rdg&gt;</code> . By coexisting we mean that the textual content of the  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> ,  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> , or  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  is in the same location in the sentence. This corresponds with the TEI Guidelines’ remark that  “Since the purpose of this [the  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code> ] element is solely to group its child elements together, the order in which they are presented is not significant.” <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>As described in <a href="#section2-4">section 2.4</a>, a current approach to the automated collation of in-text revisions is to flatten the TEI-XML transcription to a stream of plain text characters, thereby ignoring the TEI-XML markup elements that indicate nonlinear text. In order to fully understand the challenges that arise when we  <em>do</em>  wish to avoid flattening and instead take a text’s nonlinear features into account, we first need to take a closer look at how in-text revisions can be modelled in TEI-XML.</p>
<h2 id="23-modeling-nonlinearity">2.3. Modeling Nonlinearity</h2>
<p>A TEI-XML transcription of a straightforward text consists typically of fully ordered data. For textual scholars, the value and meaning of this data are primarily in the textual content, not in the TEI-XML elements. As a consequence, the order of the TEI-XML elements is meaningful. In the TEI-XML expert below, changing the order of the two  <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>  elements with their textual content would alter the meaning of the text:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;p&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;s&gt;</span>The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new.<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/s&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;s&gt;</span>Murphy sat out of it, as though he were free, in a mew in West Brompton.<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/s&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We have argued in the previous section that the textual data of a TEI-XML transcription of a manuscript with in-text revisions can be understood as an ordered stream of text characters, which splits into two or more paths when textual variation occurs. Or, put metaphorically by Michael Sperberg-McQueen, this type of text forms  “curves that intersect, run together for a while, and then split apart again, like the channels in a river delta”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. By way of illustration, let’s take the following TEI-XML example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;p&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;s&gt;</span>The <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;subst&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;del&gt;</span>quick<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/del&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;add&gt;</span>brown<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/add&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/subst&gt;</span> fox. <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/s&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The stream of textual data starts by being fully ordered with The. At the point in the text where variation occurs (marked with  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code> ), the stream splits into two paths that run parallel to one another. The textual data  <em>within</em>  the two  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  paths is again fully ordered as each path contains a linear stream of text characters. From a purely informational perspective, the deleted word quick is on the same level in the XML tree as the added word brown: they are both the textual content of the child elements of the  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  element and they occur in the same place in the text. In other words, their position vis-à-vis their parent element is the same. At the end of the variation (marked with  <code>&lt;/subst&gt;</code> ) the two paths converge again into one stream.</p>
<p>The order in which TEI-XML elements are placed also carries philological or semantic value. In the field of digital scholarly editing it is generally acknowledged that markup represents valuable editorial knowledge and that the tags reflect an interpretation of the inscriptions on the source document. Compare for instance</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;s&gt;</span>The <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;subst&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;del&gt;</span>quick<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/del&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;add&gt;</span>brown<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/add&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/subst&gt;</span> fox. <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/s&gt;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the first case, the encoder groups together the deletion and the addition as part of one and the same revision. The elements  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  are in the same hierarchical location in the XML tree (again, both are children of the  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  element).<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  In the second case, the deletion and the addition are interpreted as seperate interventions. The  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  element precedes the  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  element, which denotes a chronological order: first the word quick was deleted, then the word brown was added. In order for a collation tool to produce an output that corresponds with this interpretation of in-text revision, it should both recognize the start of parallel paths marked with  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  or  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> / <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> , and take into account the chronological order implied by the order of the  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  tags without a  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  or  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>  parent.</p>
<h2 id="24-current-approaches-to-collating-in-text-revisions">2.4. Current Approaches to Collating In-text Revisions</h2>
<p>This section presents a concise discussion of the existing approaches to collating in-text revisions. We leave aside the manual collation method of TEI Parallel Segmentation and others and concentrate on the methods of automated collation.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>  As mentioned above, current automated collation tools are generally text-centered and do not handle TEI-XML well: they ignore all tags and attributes, or collate the elements as plain text. The nonlinear aspect of texts with revisions as described above, is ignored. If a scholar would want to automatically compare XML files, they could opt for (1) passing along information marked as relevant to the study of in-text variation (with CollateX, collation software; see <a href="#section2-4-1">section 2.4.1</a>), or (2) creating plain text files for each level of in-text variation (for instance with MVD, a storage format for text; see <a href="#section2-4-2">section 2.4.2</a>). As far as we know, both approaches are implemented by at least one edition project.</p>
<h2 id="241-passing-along-relevant-markup-elements">2.4.1. Passing Along Relevant Markup Elements</h2>
<p>The JSON input format of the collation tool CollateX allows for extra properties to be added to words <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. A number of projects make use of the JSON input format to “pass along” additional information about relevant markup elements through the collation pipeline. In a pre-processing step, the text is tokenized and transformed into JSON word tokens. Editors make a selection of elements that they wish to attach to the JSON token as a  <em>t</em>  property (t for token). The collation is executed on the value of the token’s  <em>n</em>  property (n for normalized), but the  <em>t</em>  property with the tag(s) is included in the JSON alignment table output and can be processed in the table’s visualization. This approach is used, among others, by the aforementioned BDMP; the online critical edition of the Primary Chronicles, or  <em>Povest’ vremennyx let</em> , created by David J. Birnbaum; and the work on the  <em>Declamations</em>  of Calpurnius Flaccus done by Elisa Nury <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. The advantages of this approach are, first, that a witness with in-text variation can be collated as one text and, secondly, that the method approximates the goal of having nonlinear revisions marked as such in both in- and output. The main disadvantage is that the collation algorithm still treats the input witness as linear text: the witnesses are collated as such and any information about revision campaigns is ignored during the collation process.</p>
<h2 id="242-creating-separate-plain-text-files-for-each-level-of-variation">2.4.2. Creating Separate Plain Text Files For Each Level of Variation</h2>
<p>Another approach is to transcribe a manuscript with in-text revisions as two or more separate plain text versions and then collate these temporary versions against each other. The advantage of this method is that it succeeds in aligning the two parts of a substitution vertically instead of horizontally (which the previous approach is forced to do), but the drawback is that the deletions and additions are spread over two or more (sub)versions. What is more, the revisions on a manuscript do not always lend themselves to a clean separation into different layers.</p>
<p>The approach is presented by Desmond Schmidt’s Multi-Version Document system, as integrated into Ecdosis,  “A CMS for scholarly editors.” <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  In a 2019 article, Schmidt describes in detail how this layered approach also allows for the inclusion of in-text variation <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. At the transcription phase, a manuscript text is divided into levels by the scholarly editor. All changes to the baseline text of a document (level 1) are grouped as being on level 2. Subsequent changes to level 2 are grouped as level 3. For each of these levels a separate text is created, a layer:   “We do not claim that a layer is a text the author ever completed; it is not a  <em>version</em>  as such,”  explains Schmidt,  “It is simply a compact way to capture local changes.” <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  Each of these artificial layers is fed into Ecdosis as plain text, with a few additional features encoded in stand-off markup. The Ecdosis approach is implemented in the Charles Harpur Critical Archive. For example, the text of Harpur’s poem  “To the Comet”  is divided into three layers. The document identifier english/harpur/poems/h595f/layer-2 points to the second layer of the poem’s text. Layer 2 is followed by h595f/layer-final, in which corrections on the third level are carried out on the text of layer 2.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  The scholarly editors of the Charles Harpur Critical Archive see no issue in this mechanical grouping of in-text variation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assignment to levels is mechanical and describes a purely local succession of changes, which can almost always be determined. Authors leave many clues as to the succession of variants: position (above the line, then below, in the margin, on another page), the carrying over of changed text between levels, sense and crossing-out. Where the local temporal succession can’t be established this is usually because the corrections themselves can’t be read.<br>
<a href="https://charles-harpur.org/View/Singleview/?docid=english/harpur/poems/h595&amp;version1=/h595f/layer-final">( <em>Ibid</em> .)</a> The versions and layers in plain text are merged into one Multi-Version Document. It stores the text shared by each version and layer only once. Note that the comparison algorithm works at the character level, not at word level. In the table visualization, therefore, words may be cut up (see <a href="#figure01">figure 1</a>).</p>

<h2 id="243-diff-algorithms-to-compare-xml-documents">2.4.3. Diff Algorithms to Compare XML Documents</h2>
<p>Evidently, XML is a widely used standard for (online) publishing and data-exchange, and there is a general need for comparing and versioning XML documents. Accordingly, there exists a wide variety of diff algorithms or deltas to find the differences between two XML documents, each with its own strengths and focus <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Because most XML documents are data-centric and contain record-based data, deltas typically consider XML documents as hierarchically structured trees and compare them as such. Considering our type of material – text-centric XML documents in which the left-to-right order of the siblings is significant – we specifically focused on tools that can compare ordered XML trees.</p>
<p>We found a number of useful tools and algorithms, like the commercial tools Microsoft’s XML Diff and Patch or the XML compare tool of DeltaXML, that can compare both ordered and unordered XML trees.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  Such tools can come in handy during the making of a digital edition, for instance when scholarly editors wish to compare and align TEI-XML transcriptions of the same text that were made by two different scholars of the same project. Furthermore, there exist XML editors with a built-in function to compare XML documents. Oxygen XML Editor, for example, allows its users to compare two XML documents on the level of lines, words, or characters, or to ignore attributes or namespaces.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>
<p>There is, however, an important difference between current XML comparison tools and algorithms, and how we designed HyperCollate. Existing tools compare XML documents and focus on the parent nodes, whereas HyperCollate  <em>interprets</em>  XML documents in order to better compare the versions of a text. It does not ignore the structure of the XML tree, but – in line with the research objectives of scholarly editors – it focuses on comparing text and is only concerned with the TEI-XML tags that determine the flow of a text with revisions. Given this fundamental difference in premise, an extensive analysis of the quality and use of diff algorithms and tools is beyond the scope of this article.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="3-automated-collation-of-nonlinear-text">3. Automated Collation of Nonlinear Text</h2>
<h2 id="31-nonlinearity-and-variant-graphs">3.1. Nonlinearity and Variant Graphs</h2>
<p>As the previous section showed, automated collation software usually does not take in-text revisions into account. Yet we find that texts with revisions have a complex richness that deserves to be treated with attention to detail, in transcription as well as in collation, so as to produce a more accurate and detailed record of the textual variance. The collation result of HyperCollate needed to correspond with the scholarly editor’s interpretation of the in-text variance, which meant that the tool should be able to recognize and respect the nonlinear nature of the input text as it was expressed in TEI-XML markup.</p>
<p>The first step we took in enabling a collation tool to recognize in-text variation in a witness was establishing formal (i.e., exhaustive and unambiguous) rules for the way in which the program needed to process it. As described in <a href="#section2-2">section 2.2</a>, we regard a revision as a temporary interruption in the linear text stream, so we wanted HyperCollate to be able to treat it as such. In order for this to work, the collation tool would have to recognize and interpret the markup elements indicating the start and end of nonlinearity in the TEI-XML input transcription:  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code> . Secondly, we regard the elements  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> ,  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> , or  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  as indicators of the start of a separate path through the text – one branch of the text stream – and we would want the collation program to select the best match from these branches.</p>
<p>A fitting model of nonlinear text is presented by the variant graph data structure. The variant graph consists of a set of nodes that represent textual objects, and edges that connect one node to another node in the graph. The graphs are acyclic, which means that they are read from left to right without looping back. As Tara Andrews and Caroline Macé write, a variant graph is an elegant way to represent nonlinear text:  “one may imagine a text running from beginning to end with a number of points of divergence, where each witness takes a single path through these divergences”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. Variant graphs are relatively well-known in the field of automated collation and occur both as internal data model <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> and for visualization purposes (e.g., the stemma graph or the variant graph, <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>). As Elisa Nury writes, the first use of a variant graph to express textual variation can be traced to E.C. Colwell and E.W. Tune in 1964, although it was with the 2009 article of Desmond Schmidt and Robert Colomb that the variant graph gained a foothold in the field of textual scholarship <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> (See <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>). Their variant graph has the text and sigla placed on the edges of the graph (<a href="#figure02">figure 2</a>). Common text is merged, and variant text results in separate branches.</p>

<p>CollateX adopted the variant graph, but modified it to place the text in the nodes of the graph, and the sigla on the edges (see <a href="#figure03">figure 3</a>). This ensures not only a better readability, but also improves processing as the edges have only one label (one or more sigla).</p>
<p>There is another, more subtle yet important distinction between the variant graph as proposed by Schmidt and Colomb, and the variant graph as implemented by CollateX. The data structure of the variant graph in figure 3 appears simpler than it is. At first glance, the textual content of the first node (The) appears to be shared by witness 1 (W1) and witness 2 (W2). In fact, each node in the CollateX variant graph represents  <em>a set of text tokens</em>  that originate from one or more versions; the tokens in a set are considered equal by the CollateX collation algorithm. The main point being that the tokens are not modeled on textual content, as is the case with the variant graph of Schmidt and Colomb. In CollateX’s variant graph model, arbitrary tokens can be compared and their correspondences, differences, and order can be represented in a variant graph structure <sup id="fnref2:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. This seemingly small feature paves the way for HyperCollate’s approach to collation.</p>

<p>HyperCollate uses a  <em>hypergraph for textual variation</em> . This data structure is more flexible than trees, and it differs from regular variant graphs in that it has  <em>hyperedges</em>  which can connect multiple nodes to one another. As a result, the nodes of a hypergraph can be traversed in more than one order. Finally, the hypergraph data model of HyperCollate contains text nodes as well as markup nodes. This means that the markup node of, say, a  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  element can be connected to multiple text nodes which do not immediately have to follow one another. As a result, it is possible to express multiple, overlapping or nonlinear dimensions of a text in markup.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  Moreover, the hypergraph also enables the representation of individual witnesses with in-text variance as a hypergraph (see <a href="#figure04">figure 4</a>).</p>
<p>HyperCollate is trained on the two ways of encoding in-text revisions as proposed by the TEI and discussed in section 2.2: it acts whenever it encounters either a  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code> , an  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> , or their children  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> ,  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> , or  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> . These TEI-XML elements are interpreted as instances of nonlinear text, with the opening tags marking a break in the linear sequence of the text characters, and the closing tags identifying the return to linearity. Let&rsquo;s take for Witness 1 the same example of a simple TEI-XML transcription we used above:</p>

        <p>Schematic workflow of HyperCollate.

</figure>
<p>Figure 6 represents the pipeline of HyperCollate. First, the TEI-XML transcribed texts (here XML witness 1 and XML witness 2) are transformed into individual variant hypergraphs. These variant hypergraphs are subsequently segmented and the resulting tokens are aligned. The alignment is carried out on the level of the text; the markup elements  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  are recognized as occurrences of nonlinearity. Subsequently, the resulting set of matches are merged with the two individual hypergraph witnesses. The result of the collation is a collation hypergraph in which all text nodes that are not aligned are unique to one of the two hypergraph witnesses, and all the text nodes that are aligned are reduced to one node. There are labels on the edges indicating which node is part of which hypergraph. For every witness, then, there is always a fully connected path through the hypergraph from the start text node to the end text node, following the sigils on the edges. The collation hypergraph can be visualized or exported in alignment table format, SVG, PNG, or dot format. If there are more than two witnesses, the result of that first collation can be used as the basis of a new collation, following the method of progressive alignment.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup></p>
<p>HyperCollate does not regard the input TEI-XML files as plain text files (which would result in the aforementioned flattening of the input text): instead, each input witness is transformed into a hypergraph and these individual witness hypergraphs are subsequently collated against each other. In short, HyperCollate can compare TEI-XML files with in-text revisions without having to convert them to a plain text character string. During the alignment, HyperCollate looks at all branches within each witness hypergraph. If the textual content of one branch (the start of which is indicated by a  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> ,  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> , or an  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  open tag) has a match in the other witness, the text is aligned; if not, the text remains in a separate branch in the hypergraph.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tag names ( <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> ,  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> ,  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> ,  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code> , and  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> ) are not only interpreted but preserved as well, in order to enable further querying, transformation or visualization of the collation result. The visualization of the information-rich collation hypergraph opens up new possibilities and new questions. For example, if we visualize the collation output as a variant graph, should we distinguish the paths that represent variation within one witness from the paths constituted by variation between different witnesses, and if so: how?</p>
<p>As shown in section 3.3.3, <a href="#figure20">figure 20</a>, we have currently opted for placing extra marks on the edges of the visualization of the collation graph, right after the witness sigil: a minus [-] for an in-text deletion and a plus [+] for an in-text addition. In case of an in-text substitution within a substitution, this will lead to a sequence of multiple [+][-] which may not lead to a clear visualization. Of course, we can say that at this point the source manuscript text also presents a complex case of revision and this complexity is merely reflected in the collation output. Nevertheless, visualizing the collation produced by HyperCollate remains an interesting challenge (see also <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>).</p>

<p>With this TEI-XML transcription as one of the witnesses in the input for HyperCollate, we expect that the collation output retains the information about which words in a witness were in-text additions or deletions. Additions or deletions demarcate the beginning of a split in HyperCollate’s token stream. From that point on there are two substreams (the branches): one with the  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  or  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  and their textual content, and one without. The substreams merge after the closing  <code>&lt;/del&gt;</code>  or  <code>/&lt;add&gt;</code>  element.</p>

<h2 id="322-instant-revisions">3.2.2 Instant Revisions</h2>
<p>Instant revisions or currente calamo changes are revisions made within the initial writing of a sentence, with the change occurring on the same line, made in one and the same writing session. They pose a particular challenge for transcription, because they cannot be encoded as a substitution: the demarcation of the added text is problematic. Would all of the text following an instant deletion be an addition? The TEI Guidelines propose to add the attribute @instant with the value true’ to the  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  element, to distinguish between a regular correction.</p>
<p>In the following example, Beckett wrote  “threw up his”  and then crossed the three words out to continue the sentence with  “gave such a jerk at Russell&rsquo;s arm that that poor little man was nearly pulled off his feet.”</p>

<p>In this case it not make sense to tag gave such a jerk as an addition, not would it make sense to tag the rest of the sentence as such.</p>
<p>Hence we argue that an instant revision does  <em>not</em>  constitute a case of nonlinear text. In contrast to regular in-text corrections and substitutions, there is no other way of reading the text: the instant revision is part of the same writing campaign as the text surrounding it.</p>

<p>Following our interpretation of an instant revision, we would  <em>not</em>  want HyperCollate to treat it as an instance of nonlinear text. An instant deletion should be considered to be part of the same path as the text surrounding it. We do want the information about the instant revision to be present in the output, so that we can visualize the deletion appropriately.</p>

<p>As the instant revision, encoded with  <code>&lt;del instant=&quot;true&quot;&gt;</code> , does not trigger HyperCollate in the same way a regular  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  does, the individual witness hypergraph has only one path through the text. The information about the deletion is retained (see <a href="#figure11">figure 11</a>).</p>

<p>With this TEI encoded input, we expect HyperCollate to recognize the substitution as a break in the linearity of the text and to treat the two parts in a nonlinear way. Moreover, since not all text encoders group  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  elements within a  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  tag (see <a href="#section2-3">section 2.3.</a>, HyperCollate should differentiate between a substitution and an unconnected deletion and addition by providing clear rules on how to trigger its special treatment of substitutions for transcriptions that don’t include  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  elements. For now, HyperCollate implements a heuristic: if a  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  element is directly followed by an  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  element, unspaced, we take them as belonging together, so the heuristic places a  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  around the two. If the  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  elements are separated by a white space, they are not grouped together, and treated in a linear way. Of course, as with all heuristics, this is not an optimal solution, as some scholarly editors do use a white space between a  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  and an  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  element, even if they consider them to belong to the same substitution.</p>
<p>The  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  or  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>  element demarcates the beginning of a split in HyperCollate’s token stream. From that point on there are two substreams: one substream with the  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  or first  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  element and its textual content, and one substream with the  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  or second  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  element and its textual content. The  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> ,  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> , and  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  elements are unordered: they are at the same distance gromfthe root node  <code>&lt;xml&gt;</code> .</p>
<p>A  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  element can contain more than one  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  and more than one  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  element. In principle each  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  and  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  represents a new branch. A  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  can occur within another  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code> , the result is simply that the stream of text within that branch splits up again.</p>

<h2 id="324-multiple-alignment-options-in-longer-substitutions">3.2.4 Multiple Alignment Options in Longer Substitutions</h2>
<p>In the case of the substitution of a group of words, there will usually be more than one way to align the witnesses. The differences in alignment stem from a difference in focus: does the scholarly editor want to give priority to the unit of the substitution, or should the alignment of matching words receive priority? The traditional approach in collation of starting from exact string matches and grouping the variants in columns between the matches has the advantage of accentuating the similarities between witnesses, but the unit of the substitution can become obscured as it is spread over multiple columns. Holding the substitution together in the alignment, on the other hand, keeps the focus on the nonlinear nature of manuscripts as witnesses. It marks the spot where something happens on the manuscript and the totality of a textual operation is presented as one block. The drawback is a potential loss of information if the occurrence of a matching word across witnesses is not indicated in the collation output.</p>

<p>The instance of nonlinear text is visualized by two separate edges and nodes labeled with the same siglum, A. In order to make it easier to follow the path of a certain revision campaign, the edges contain not only information about the witness sigil, but also whether the text is part of a deleted or added branch. This information is visualized on the edges with [-] and [+] signs for deletions and additions respectively. Furthermore, information that is shared by more than one witness is given a thicker edge and node border (see e.g., <a href="#janicke2015">Jänicke et al. [2015]</a>). In this example, the words Cathleen and came are considered matches between A and B and thus share text nodes with a thicker border. Finally, the information about the location of the tag in the XML tree is added to the node as an XPath expression.</p>

By using CollateX’s pre-tokenized JSON input feature and attaching the extra properties del and add to tokens (<a href="#section2-4-1">section 2.4.1</a>), the BDMP can visualize additions and deletions in the generated alignment tables in the same way as it does in the transcription visualizations: deletions struck through and additions in superscript.

<p>Although the CollateX table adequately intuits the in-text revision on the manuscript through the formatting convention, the alignment that CollateX outputs is still conceptually less correct than a visualization that places Alice and Cathleen on the same level. HyperCollate combines the advantages of the two current approaches described in sections <a href="#section2-4-1">2.4.1</a> and <a href="#section2-4-2">2.4.2</a> and does not have the drawbacks. A witness with in-text variation is treated as one witness both in input and output, and the collation algorithm is able to align the two parts of the substitution vertically instead of horizontally in its output by treating them as unordered during alignment, which is a considerable step forward.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the case of the example discussed in sections <a href="#section3-2-4">3.2.4</a> and <a href="#section3-3-4">3.3.4</a>, the method of collating as one linear witness with markup passed along (<a href="#section2-4-1">section 2.4.1</a>), the CollateX output is inadequate, as the alignment table in <a href="#figure29">figure 28</a> shows. Treating the two parts of the substitution in a linear way is detrimental to the alignment. The words the arm and stayed are transposed between the first and third witness, and as the arm occurs first in the first witness, CollateX marks the arm as invariant between those two witnesses in favor of aligning stayed which occurs in all three witnesses. The HyperCollate output succeeds quite well in conveying the nonlinearity in the first witness and grouping and aligning the differences with the subsequent witnesses.</p>
<p>Splitting the first version up into two (sub)versions as discussed in <a href="#section2-4-2">section 2.4.2</a> produces the desired alignment (<a href="#figure30">figure 30</a>), but misrepresents the manuscript by including the word Murphy in version A-layer1 as well as in A-layer2, as the word Murphy only occurs once on the document.</p>

<h2 id="4-future-work">4. Future Work</h2>
<p>At the moment of writing, HyperCollate can already be used via Github or in a Kotlin notebook.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>  The collation tool is still in a prototype state and we can identify several areas of further development. On the one hand, these developments regard the tool’s functionalities, such as generating different output formats and collating witnesses regardless of the order in which they are inputted (order independent collation). At the moment, we use the progressive alignment method, which means that the order in which the witnesses are fed to the collation program influences the outcome. Evidently, we do not want the order in which the witnesses are inputted to affect the collation output, but this is a computationally highly complex issue for which as of yet no clear-cut solution has been found.</p>
<p>Another area of future work is more philological, concerning questions such as How should HyperCollate handle open variants? and Can we include other types of markup in the collation? In the following paragraphs, we will briefly expand on these and other questions.</p>
<h2 id="41-output-formats">4.1. Output Formats</h2>
<p>The output of collation software is often used as the basis for further processing or editorial correction. It is therefore important to offer a myriad of options that can be edited afterwards. HyperCollate can currently output collations either as a hypergraph (expressed in SVG, dot, PNG formats) or as an alignment table in ASCII. An HTML implementation of a comparable table format is in development.</p>
<p>We are also working on output expressed in XML. With the encoding schema we hope to stay as close to the TEI parallel segmentation method as possible. As a starting point we envisage the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;app&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;rdg</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">wit=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;#A-&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;deletion&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">varSeq=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;1&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;del&gt;</span>Alice<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/del&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/rdg&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;rdgGrp</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;tag_variation_only&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;rdg</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">wit=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;#A+&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">type=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;addition&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">varSeq=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;2&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;add&gt;</span>Cathleen<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/add&gt;&lt;/rdg&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;rdg</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">wit=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;#B&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span>Cathleen<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/rdg&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/rdgGrp&gt;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/app&gt;</span> came.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This encoding complies with the TEI guidelines except that, like in the collation hypergraphs, a + or a - is added to the siglum A when that version splits up into two branches which are placed in two  <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  elements. As the XML counterpart of a node in the graph where the witnesses have the same text but a different XML context, they are placed as separate readings in a reading group ( <code>&lt;rdgGrp&gt;</code> ). The element has a @type attribute with the value tag_variantion_only to indicate that the readings only differ in the level of the XML elements. The schema is feasible when it concerns simple substitutions, but we will need to determine how well it handles long substitutions or substitutions within substitutions.</p>
<h2 id="42-substitutions-within-a-word">4.2. Substitutions Within a Word</h2>
<p>Substitutions on the character-level within a word constitute a particular challenge to the automatic collation process. HyperCollate works at the granularity level of the word as a token, and revisions within a word produce isolated characters as tokens.</p>

<p>In TEI-XML, Beckett’s typo in Scratch (<a href="#figure31">figure 31</a>) could be transcribed as: Scratc <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> g <code>&lt;/del&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> h <code>&lt;/add&gt;</code> . Currently this encoding produces three separate tokens: Scratc,  g and h, none of which will be aligned with the occurrence of Scratch in another version. This is a very challenging problem for any collation algorithm, because it creates the need for an alignment within an alignment: aligning words in a first step and characters subsequently.</p>
<p>There are a few avenues of development to consider. An approach of near-matching might produce adequate results. Another option would be to encode the entire word within a  <code>&lt;mod&gt;</code>  element: <mod>Scratc<del>g</del><add>h</add></mod>,<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  which could trigger HyperCollate to translate this into  <code>&lt;subst&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> Scratcg <code>&lt;/del&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> Scratch <code>&lt;/add&gt;</code>  <code>&lt;/subst&gt;</code> .

<p>Open variants are also an example of nonlinearity in text. The TEI guidelines suggest that open variants should be encoded with a  <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code>  element around the inline part of the open variant, followed by one or more  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>  elements. For HyperCollate to apply the same treatment to open variants as to substitutions, it will need to recognize a  <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code>  element and treat it in a similar way to  <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>  or  <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> . Because the  <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code>  is a general element with several uses, HyperCollate will have to look for a  <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code>  element with a @type attribute with the value alternative.</p>

<p>To tag transpositions, the TEI proposes that both parts be tagged in an element with a @xml:id attribute (the element most commonly used is  <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code> ), and that the two tags be declared as a transposition inside the teiHeader, in a  <code>&lt;transpose&gt;</code>  element within a  <code>&lt;listTranspose&gt;</code> . The use of  <code>@type=&quot;transposition&quot;</code>  inside the  <code>&lt;seg&gt;</code>  is not required.</p>
<p>A transposition can be said to be a nonlinear textual feature; it signals two possible readings of a fragment with a difference in word order. Transposition metamarks, however, do not violate the linearity of the text, as the text fragment does not have two alternatives for one word or phrase, but merely suggests a reordering of two or more words. A special treatment by HyperCollate of this textual feature is not needed to provide a meaningful result. Currently, the source XML is handled by HyperCollate linearly like all other material. The actual word order is collated, and the second, implied order can still be deduced from the markup in the transcription. The same applies to transpositions of letters within words.</p>
<p>Making the two word orders explicit in the  <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> / <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>  method of transcription, however, will allow for the two versions to be collated:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In-text variation is essential for the study of textual variance and the TEI Guidelines offer several ways to encode this kind of information. Consequently, the need to include the information in the automatic collation of manuscript texts is apparent. Up to now, including in-text variation was only possible through workarounds that either require significant coding skills from the users – passing along markup tags as shadow-tokens on the JSON input of CollateX – or by manually creating pseudo-versions from the layers of in-text variation and treating them as regular versions. These approaches do ensure that information about the in-text variation is present in the collation output so that the nonlinear features of the individual witnesses can be visually reconstructed. However, the information is not part of the alignment process itself: the collation tools treat the input texts as a linear, ordered stream of characters and thus ignore the multilayered character of manuscript text.</p>
<p>In this paper, we argued that in-text variation provides meaningful information about the temporality of the writing process. We demonstrated that this type of variation constitutes nonlinear, partially ordered data and we argued that it should be treated as such by collation software. We therefore set out to develop a collation program, HyperCollate, that understands each witness as a stream of text tokens that splits into two or more branches at the point where the internal variation occurs and converges at the end of the variation. The occurrences of variation are marked by the scholarly editor with designated TEI-XML tags. HyperCollate thus produces a collation output that represents the multidimensional nature of the source text more adequately and thus corresponds with how the in-text variation was conceptualized and encoded.</p>
<p>The paper began with a description of our understanding of different types of in-text variation, and subsequently illustrated how that understanding translates logically. We then illustrated how the input of HyperCollate, TEI-XML transcriptions, are transformed into individual witness hypergraphs with partially ordered textual data. HyperCollate compares two witness hypergraphs and finds the best match between the branches of text. In case of more witnesses, HyperCollate compares them progressively. Accordingly, the TEI-XML transcriptions that hold so much scholarly information can be used as direct input without any need for pre-processing or flattening. We concluded that including the in-text variation produces a more refined output that more accurately represents the textual variation as interpreted by the scholarly editor during the transcription phase.</p>
<p>One interesting finding is that in case of a longer substitution, the best way to collate versions with in-text variation depends on the preference of the scholarly editor. They can either prefer to have the collation program align on the unit of substitution, or to align on the individual words within the substitution. Future users of HyperCollate will be able to indicate their preference in the collation command. We also found that the visualization of HyperCollate’s in- and output may depend on the user’s preference. Both the input (a witness hypergraph) and the output (a collation hypergraph) of HyperCollate can be visualized as variant hypergraphs with or without markup nodes as colored hyperedges.</p>
<p>The visualizations are an attempt to provide more insight into the text and its revisions, but visualizing such a complex data structure is quite challenging. The output of HyperCollate simply contains a lot of information, and it is difficult to visualize all that information in a clear and insightful way. This becomes evident with the alignment table visualization: the alignment table allows scholarly editors to see at a glance which words are added and deleted, but at the same time using the [-] and [+] signs for in-text deletions and additions simplify the revision process. Still, an alignment table is generally easier to read than a collation hypergraph, and so far user-testing has shown that the alignment table does feel intuitive to scholarly editors. We will continue to experiment with the visualizations of the collation hypergraph, e.g., by adding [-] and [+] signs on the edges of the collation hypergraph or by using thicker edges if a token is present in many versions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this article aimed to show how formalizing our understanding of in-text variation as nonlinear, partially ordered text can help to communicate our human understanding to a collation tool. We trained HyperCollate on two TEI encoding suggestions for in-text variation, app/rdg and subst/del/add, in order to illustrate that the formalization can work for different encoding styles. The larger argument made in this article concerns the benefits of reflecting upon our textual models and to what extent they impact our encoding models and subsequently the in- and output of text analysis tools.</p>
<p>The development of HyperCollate was propelled by a knowledge exchange between textual scholars and research software engineers. This exchange took the form of long discussions, much prototyping, experimenting, and testing. Realizing the value of our collaboration and ongoing knowledge exchange, we have tried to be transparent about our methodology and detailed our textual theories and expectations of the software as well as the decision making process of HyperCollate. Indeed, we found collaborating on the development of a collation program an insightful, iterative learning process that emphasizes the benefits of including computational methods in manuscript research.</p>

<p>We recognize that a TEI-XML transcription is not synonymous with an embedded markup file; there exist non-TEI and standoff approaches to transcribing manuscripts with revisions as well.

<p>Archival materials related to the experiences of transgender and gender-nonconforming people are often difficult to locate due to the relative scarcity of these materials and the access barriers presented by brick-and-mortar archives (e.g., geographic, financial, environmental, intellectual) <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The global pandemic exacerbated such barriers, causing in-person research to be temporarily suspended and, as of this writing, continually disrupted. Digital access is therefore more important now than ever.</p>
<p>The Digital Transgender Archive (DTA) is a free online collection of trans-related primary source historical materials and information on undigitized archival collections held throughout the world. The goal of the project is to leverage an open-access digital archive to mitigate barriers to research on transgender and gender-nonconforming people. When the DTA moved institutions in mid-2020, we chose this natural lull to conduct the project’s first audit. Our aim was to thoroughly examine every aspect of the project to identify our strengths and areas for growth while charting a course for continued development and vibrancy into the future. In preparation for this audit, we searched for published models, examples, or theorizations of auditing a digital project, but we found little scholarship to guide our work. To contribute to this area, this article presents a project report that shares the findings of our yearlong audit of the DTA. We begin with an introduction to the DTA alongside a discussion of existing scholarship on Digital Humanities project lifecycles and evaluative procedures. We then highlight five key observations that the audit revealed and how we addressed (or plan to address) those observations. In using this observation/response structure, we offer readers the distilled results of our audit in a format that we hope will be easy to apply to other Digital Humanities (DH) projects.</p>
<p>DH projects generally move through fairly predictable cycles, often including startup, dissemination, maintenance, and sustainability (or abandonment) stages. Given that cultural and institutional pressures guide digital humanities scholars towards innovation <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, it is unsurprising that there is an abundance of scholarship, resources, and workshops designed to aid digital humanists at the planning and inception stages of a project’s life, leading some to suggest that DH scholars  “specialize in imagining and launching digital projects”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. On the opposite end of the project lifecycle are well-known concerns about the problem of orphaned projects left to wither on the vine <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Projects have met more successful ends when transitioned into being preserved as digital archives <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Of course maintaining an ongoing project exists as an alternative to ending or abandoning projects. As an archive recording trans histories which remain ongoing and often inaccessible except through the DTA’s interventions, we are committed to maintaining and developing the DTA.</p>
<p>Like many DH projects, the startup phase of the DTA, from approximately 2013 to 2018, was a period of feverish growth. Following a model that will be familiar to readers, the DTA is a collaborative online aggregator of historical materials that are contributed by a range of cultural heritage institutions. Boosted by the support of a Digital Innovation grant from the American Council of Learned Societies, the DTA initially launched in January of 2016 while Rawson was a faculty member at the College of the Holy Cross. For the next several years, Rawson worked to build the collection with a dynamic team of undergraduate students and, when funding allowed, Digital Archivist Nicole Tantum. Software developer Steven Anderson, an external consultant funded through small internal grants, has also been key to our success as he is responsible for both the preliminary development and continued maintenance of the site. During this initial growth stage, we focused on deepening our collaborative networks and implementing a functional database that would have sufficient resources to attract researchers.</p>
<p>As we invested more time and resources into the project, our collaborative network expanded and the size of our collections grew. As of January 2022, we have 70 contributors from eight countries (Brazil, Canada, England, Ireland, Norway, Spain, South Africa, United States). These collaborators represent a range of cultural institutions––from grassroots archives and historical societies to university and public libraries––and most are primarily brick-and-mortar organizations. We currently have approximately 8,800 items available on our site, a small percentage of which were directly donated to the project and are not available for researchers to access in physical archives. The project’s primary purpose is to increase the accessibility of trans history. We accomplish this through our centralized database of primary source materials and our efforts to identify and include a wide range of materials fitting under a capacious banner of pre-2000, non-normative gender practices. In other words, our collections are not only focused on individuals who identify as transgender; instead, we include documentations of any experiences relating to transgressions of gender norms (in relation to particular cultural and historical contexts).</p>
<p>With our expanding collaborations and content, we became increasingly aware of the responsibilities involved in maintaining this important resource. We attuned ourselves to conversations in DH about orphaned projects and project sustainability, though we noted the lack of consensus among digital humanists as to what sustainability means exactly <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Within the unique challenges of the digital ecosystem, sustainability may involve  “continuity of funding, data preservation (including choice of standards and longevity of data) and the need for flexibility in order to change business models,”  particularly as digital platforms transform or become obsolete <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Thus, building a sustainable project can mean maintaining an organization or institution with evolving goals beyond the initial project, preserving data and metadata internally for continued access and (inter)operability, or transferring the project to the community so it can be adapted to stakeholders’ evolving needs <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Yet, according to <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, sustainable DH projects are often expected to be accessible to users long-term “without further requirement of investment or resources from the original funder of the work.” This model of sustainability centers around ongoing access without considering growth and responsiveness to shifting contexts. As a result, recommendations for stagnating long-term projects typically include renewed dissemination efforts and interdepartmental collaboration to increase visibility <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While we found these discussions of the startup and sustainability stages of DH project lifecycles to be quite helpful, we also observed that the maintenance stage has received considerably less attention, perhaps because it is the least glamorous part of any DH project. As Ashley Reed notes, there remain many opportunities to discuss how to maintain a DH project and keep it healthy and thriving <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>. In order to prevent project decay, a robust approach to the management and continuation of projects can helpfully supplement attention to the startup and sustainability stages. However, long-term collaborative projects may not always document or publish the critical maintenance work they undertake after the first stage of dissemination. Therefore, we find ourselves in agreement with Edin Tabak that DH must better attend to issues of project management and, moreover, develop models and principles specifically suited toward our field <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Attending to these issues is particularly important because DH approaches change not only the ways scholars disseminate information, but also the ways  “they work, the tools they build, the disciplines they connect to”   <sup id="fnref2:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>With respect to the DTA, as we focused on developing and launching the platform and meeting grant deliverables, we had little time to evaluate the project as it emerged. Many of the DTA’s features, policies, and internal documents had not been reviewed since the first few years of our startup phase. In some cases, policies that had become integral to the project over the years had never been formally recorded. The majority of the DTA’s materials have been processed by revolving teams of undergraduate students, making it difficult to maintain consistent practices. These issues were exacerbated by the DTA’s move to Northeastern in fall 2020 and the complexities of working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, as our previous model for workflow depended on a physical lab space in which new team members were trained by veteran ones. Because crucial process-based work went undocumented, it also could not be critiqued or modeled by community stakeholders or fellow DH practitioners, which is a noted problem in the field <sup id="fnref3:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Similarly, the movement from a physical lab space to a digital environment made processing materials a less collaborative and efficient experience, resulting in metadata that required additional review before it could be made public and demonstrating why project workflow must be sustainable across changes in platform <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>When Rawson began a new position at Northeastern University (NU) in the fall of 2020, the move presented an ideal opportunity to hit pause on expanding the project and instead conduct a robust audit in order to adapt to a new institutional environment. The audit was also well-timed from a project development standpoint because the DTA had settled into collections development without conducting a thorough evaluation of our site, our holdings, or our planned growth. In order to move toward future grants and new collaborations with purpose and intention, it was important to fully and candidly consider where we stand now.</p>
<p>We understand audits as comprehensive and evaluative analyses of data collected on a given project to gauge efficacy. Audits are common across many realms, and can be particularly useful for digital humanists seeking to appraise a project’s success and plan for future development. In auditing the DTA, we evaluated the site’s goals and the degree to which it accomplishes those goals while also developing concrete strategies for growth. Most importantly, we sought to ensure the DTA was adequately serving its mission of making trans history accessible and identified ways to better serve that mission. To conduct the audit, Rawson was able to enlist two NU Ph.D. students––co-authors Eamon Schlotterback and Cailin Roles ––who led the audit as part of their 10-hour-per-week graduate research assistant positions. In order to comprehensively audit the project, we decided to spend the full year on this work (with some of our time still focused on small-scale processing and supporting a 3-member team of volunteers)<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> . Our goal was to assess every aspect of the project, paying particular attention to scope, accessibility, usability (for researchers inside and outside the academy), and outreach (especially social media presence). Because Eamon and Cailin were still gaining familiarity with the DTA and were thus uniquely positioned to respond to the project from the perspective of a new user, our approach was broadly structured to move from the outside in. Therefore, we pursued our audit through the following steps: (1) we began with our outward facing presence, including social media, static pages on our site, and reviews of the project; (2) we examined other projects and targeted areas for feature development; (3) we focused on the database and collection scope by evaluating the status of our collaborations, researching new materials from existing collaborators, and identifying gaps in our holdings; (4) we closely reviewed our metadata and addressed areas of concern; and (5) we concluded by evaluating our options for project workflow and lab space on campus.</p>
<p>Throughout each step of the audit, we also employed a series of checks to ensure that the DTA site content and features aligned as much as possible with widely accepted standards for accessibility. Specifically, we compared our practices to those recommended in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a> and ran the site through accessibility evaluation tools such as <a href="https://fae.disability.illinois.edu/anonymous/?Anonymous%20Report=/">Functional Accessibility Evaluator 2.2</a> and <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a>. We also reviewed blogs and forums written by and for screen reader users and downloaded an open-access screen reader, <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NV Access</a>, to test the site. We plan to continue running these checks routinely to ensure the DTA site is as accessible to as many users as possible, and we encourage others to adopt similar practices.</p>
<p>In publishing our account of the audit and its results, our purpose is twofold: first, we want to share specific insights into the state of our project and the results of this maintenance audit; and second, we want to offer a model for DH practitioners who are performing their own evaluations of their projects or who may want to extrapolate some of our results to improve other DH projects.</p>
<h2 id="observation-1-assessment-of-scope">Observation #1: Assessment of Scope</h2>
<p>Since the DTA initially launched in 2016, there have been significant developments in the understanding of trans history and the language used to describe gender-nonconforming (GNC) people and practices. With renewed scholarly and public interest in trans identities, there has also been an increasing push to digitize more trans-related historical materials, in part due to dissatisfaction with the oversaturation of materials relating to white trans women. Within this context, we spent a significant amount of time during the audit evaluating the DTA’s scope to better adapt to the shifting landscape of trans history.</p>
<p>We were interested in interrogating scope on a number of levels, including: genre of materials; dates covered; race and ethnicities represented; trans identities represented; and types of experiences documented. Among the elements of scope we considered, race and ethnicity were particularly important to us. As VanHaitsma and others have observed in reviewing the project, and as Rawson has discussed in interviews and his own publications, the DTA’s holdings skew toward white U.S. and Canadian subjects <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. This trend reflects a larger concern regarding the lack of diversity in the digital humanities writ large. Per <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>, many of the most developed digital humanities projects preserve the writings and histories of well-known white men, individuals unlikely to be otherwise forgotten. While our materials disrupt that trend by focusing on individuals whose lives have been largely relegated to the margins of history, it is also true that white U.S. and Canadian trans histories have been better preserved than any others, resulting in concerning racial inequities in archival representation.</p>
<p>As one of extraordinarily few archives focused on trans experiences, it is critical that we attend to these issues of impact and access. Researchers interested in trans history have had to negotiate a number of systematic challenges — including lack of communication across archival institutions and the recent emergence and cultural specificity of the term transgender — that make it difficult to determine where trans materials are held and what those materials are. Furthermore, historical materials depicting people of color who transgress gender norms are even less likely to have been preserved or archived. Unless we pay careful attention to these issues, it is all too easy for projects like the DTA to unwittingly reproduce a narrative of trans history focused on the experiences of white North Americans and Europeans.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> further suggests that the DTA&rsquo;s holdings skew toward transfeminine-related materials with a proportionally smaller number of transmasculine materials. Such inequities in our holdings reveal the complexities of representation in a project guided by trans-affirming ethics. As we expand our collection of transmasculine objects, we recognize that the differential representations of transfeminine and transmasculine subjects is due in part to a visual regime that renders trans men  “invisibilized and ignored”  and trans women  “glamourized and vilified”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. More images of transfeminine people can be archived and published in part because of how transfeminine people have been spectacularized by a transmisogynist social context <sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. This is also complicated by the fact that certain forms of trans visibility often further marginalize trans people and lead to transphobic violence, which disproportionately targets trans people of color <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Although part of our audit was to identify and fill gaps in our collections, simply adding items to fill a quota was insufficient to our aims. The complex histories of racism and transphobia demanded we reevaluate the quality of the items we host.</p>
<p>Before we began working to increase the number of people with marginalized identities represented in the DTA, it was necessary to closely examine how and why we choose to represent people’s identities overall. Our audit began at the tail end of the summer of 2020, when the United States was reckoning with its continued history of anti-Blackness following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, which deeply informed our work. The audit became an opportunity to renew our approach to archiving objects depicting BIPOC, to learn from Black and anti-racist archival practices, and reconsider how we frame historically significant objects depicting racism <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Over the course of the audit, we identified a number of gaps in the content we make available on our site, as well as issues with the DTA’s current representation practices, particularly regarding marginalized groups we (three white settler academics) are not a part of. For instance, the complexities of Two-Spirit identities and their inclusion on the DTA was a recurring concern, one we realized could only be addressed through deeper collaborations with Two-Spirit groups. Our work to address scope therefore became inseparable from our ethical commitments to and work with BIPOC communities.</p>
<h2 id="response-extending-our-collaborations-building-our-collections-and-planning-for-the-future">Response: Extending Our Collaborations, Building Our Collections, and Planning for the Future</h2>
<p>A central project completed over the course of our audit was our search for potential additions to our holdings, both to diversify the scope of the project going forward and to ensure that we provide broad access to as many trans-related historical materials as possible. We approached this search for materials with two objectives in mind: 1) to identify new materials at institutions we have existing relationships with; and 2) to locate new institutions and collections for future collaborations.</p>
<p>Among our partnered institutions’ collections, we found over 300 items that were already digitized and could be made available on the DTA, ranging from nineteenth-century medical literature to 1960s glamour shots. Of these, we prioritized certain materials for immediate processing based on gaps in our current holdings. For instance, materials related to incarceration and GNC children became higher priorities, whereas drag show programs were less pressing since we already have a preponderance of those items. As we filled some of the gaps in our collection, we sought opportunities to not simply add items  <em>depicting</em>  marginalized individuals, but to prioritize materials in which these subjects speak for themselves. These materials include items such as oral histories with trans men and people of color, manifestos written by trans women of color, and a collection of web resources related to Two-Spirit communities.</p>
<p>Our search for new partners was fruitful beyond our aims. At the start of our audit, we had 64 contributing partners, but we have since added five more to the DTA site and identified an additional 15 that we plan to reach out to in order to form collaborations.These new institutions include organizations with significant holdings related to transmasculine individuals, Indigenous peoples of New Zealand, and Asian Americans. Our goal in collaborating with more archives, especially community- and trans- and BIPOC-led archives, is not only to make more items related to trans history available online, but also to build mutually beneficial relationships with our partners. Another result of these efforts is that we are currently pursuing funding for a large-scale project that will allow us to work with our partners to digitize thousands of pages of materials related to trans people of color, as well as improve our anti-racist description practices through a BIPOC-led steering committee.</p>
<p>Even six years since it went live, the DTA remains one of extraordinarily few archives devoted to trans experiences, and many of our materials are only accessible to the public through the DTA. Our position as one of the few freely available archival resources on trans people necessitates that we expand our holdings to better represent the full spectrum of trans experience and to continually strengthen our commitments to ethical representation. Like many long-term DH projects, our work over the years has often focused on expanding the quantity of materials rather than quality of representation. This is not uncommon — as <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> discusses, DH projects often  “[equate] decolonization with the need for diversity in the field,”  as if  “the mere addition of ‘diverse’ bodies will transform the practices of digital humanities”  and the traces of colonialism therein. Instead, as we evaluated the scope of the DTA, we also worked to strengthen and extend our relationships with BIPOC-focused initiatives, pursue funding for projects to enhance access to trans BIPOC histories, develop antiracist description policies, and enact more informed mechanisms of representation.</p>
<h2 id="observation-2-metadata-concerns-in-relation-to-privacy-and-description-policies">Observation #2: Metadata Concerns in Relation to Privacy and Description Policies</h2>
<p>Assessing the DTA’s scope led us to larger questions about the ways we describe materials hosted on the site. Since the project’s start, we have attempted to maintain consistent descriptive practices by implementing a metadata application profile (MAP), a detailed document that outlines requirements and best practices for each metadata element (e.g., Title, Subject Coverage, Description). However, over the course of the DTA’s history, a number of different people from different backgrounds and levels of archival experience have participated in processing materials, which has resulted in discrepancies in the metadata for different objects.</p>
<p>Although DTA materials are discoverable through metadata and the terms used within the materials, there were numerous inconsistencies regarding the usage of certain elements and descriptive practices for trans identities and practices. For example, the most commonly used term in subject coverage was crossdressers, though in many instances the materials predated the term and it was unlikely the subjects represented would identify with it. This practice was in contrast to our policy, which cautions against assuming individuals’ identities without self-acknowledgement. At the same time, this policy was more consistently applied in regards to race and ethnicity, which meant that materials focused on people of color were too often unmarked in the metadata. As a result, race often became hidden or obscured while gender identity was frequently overdetermined. Additionally, we noticed that in some cases, our metadata reproduced harmful language practices from other institutions and that some items were published with little description because team members were unsure how to interpret their content and account for their complexity.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/about/policies">policies</a> regarding privacy, explicit content, and descriptive practices have always been publicly available on the project site, and the DTA has been widely praised for its collaborative nature and continued accountability to the community <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. In recognizing this strength and the benefits it has offered to others, we saw an opportunity to further develop this dimension of the project. Simultaneously, as the project has grown and we have received feedback, our implementation of our policies has become more complex––for example, determining whether exploitative or private materials should be public or how to address harmful language––and we wanted to find a way to convey that complexity. In other words, we needed to evaluate whether there were any gaps between our stated policies and our everyday practices and to consider how we could make our internal processes even more transparent for users.</p>
<h2 id="response-revision-of-map-and-policies">Response: Revision of MAP and Policies</h2>
<p>To get a better sense of what MAP and policy changes might be in order, we began by evaluating our collections and compiling a list of metadata-related concerns and best practices. Aware of our limitations as a U.S.-based team that is predominantly white, we researched the policies of a number of BIPOC-led digital archives, DH projects, and social justice organizations. In addition, we found Antracoli et al.’s  <em>Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia: Anti-Racist Description Resources</em>  to be a particularly helpful resource <sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In some cases, addressing metadata issues on the DTA required simply correcting typos. Other issues necessitated case-by-case analysis and editorial flexibility. For example, we reached out to an individual represented in our materials who changed his name to ask how we should refer to him when processing materials he created before the name change. His answer — that we could either update his name or maintain both names — reflects his personal choice rather than archival best practices..<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  This example shows why it is important to consider not only whether data practices are consistent and (inter)operable but whether they are ethical and what impact they have on people. When possible, it is ideal to reach out to individuals represented in the collections so that they can determine how they should be described in the metadata.</p>
<p>We also expanded our project-wide policies to clarify our processes for describing gender, race, ethnicity, and other identity markers. Though our metadata typically adopts language already used in the materials and language known to be used by the individuals represented, we often process items that cannot be neatly categorized, such as photographs with no extant context. The decisions we make in describing these items may not be immediately clear to visitors of the site, which could make them difficult to locate or result in misunderstanding of historical terminology. Therefore, as we evaluate ways to best represent individuals’ identities, we also turn a critical eye toward harmful language practices in the archival field. We have sought to disrupt racist and transphobic materials or descriptions by questioning whether to make available compelling but ethically questionable items, adding critical framing to descriptions of complicated items, and removing harmful descriptions and metadata inherited from contributing institutions. To support our team members in describing complex items, we began writing short reference documents that include language and framing suggestions as well as contextual information to guide them through the difficult and thorny process of respectfully and accurately representing trans and GNC subjects. We have also developed content warnings within the Description field for items with potentially harmful language and imagery.</p>
<p>As we resolved specific metadata issues and revised our policies and processing workflow, we also began to write a new edition of the DTA MAP that better reflects our current descriptive practices. This work includes clarifying how fields like Spatial Coverage become searchable so team members can apply it more effectively and updating Subject Coverage examples to match the newest version of <a href="https://homosaurus.org/">Homosaurus</a>, the LGBTQ+ linked data vocabulary we use to supplement the Library of Congress Subject Headings. While in the past the MAP has only been available to team members and contributors, we have chosen to make the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11LNJ0YEsdi-g7EsoVDIdSWeWTJ_Y1vEtILc_mHqCRBo/edit">DTA MAP 3.0</a> publicly accessible on the project website, both to encourage feedback from our stakeholders and to provide a model for other DH projects writing or revising their own MAPs.</p>
<h2 id="observation-3-incomplete-tracking-of-project-use-and-reception">Observation #3: Incomplete Tracking of Project Use and Reception</h2>
<p>In the six years since the DTA went live, the project and items from its collections have been taken up by academic researchers, pop culture journalists, intrigued readers, documentary filmmakers, and teachers of all kinds. We have taken great joy in seeing how the DTA has been utilized and engaged, often posting to our social media channels items that refer to the DTA and circulating these items among students working on the project. At no point, however, did we formally track such qualitative usage, even though measurable evidence of a project’s impact is critical for grant writing efforts. Additionally, while the DTA’s mission is to make trans history more accessible to a wide public audience, we had no dedicated methods for evaluating users’ experiences in accessing our materials.</p>
<p>Throughout the life of the project, we have relied on Google Analytics to track site usage and Google Alerts to keep up-to-date with mentions of the DTA online.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  While analytics seem reliable, alerts have proven to be quite fallible and we often became aware of invaluable references to the DTA long after the fact. Our sense of this engagement was impressionistic, favoring the more memorable coverage, and we could not report with confidence on trends and patterns in the data. Without a means of consistently tracking project use and reception, it became difficult to measure the impact of the DTA for funding applications or to prioritize our users’ needs when forming new collaborations.</p>
<h2 id="response-systematic-collection-and-summary-of-reviews-and-usages-of-the-dta">Response: Systematic Collection and Summary of Reviews and Usages of the DTA</h2>
<p>We initially considered conducting a typical usability test to better understand the project’s uptake and user interactions; however, we quickly recognized that soliciting test users during the pandemic would be difficult and potentially unsafe. Tabling the usability test for the time being, we decided instead to systematically evaluate usage of the project through reviews, discussions, and mentions of the DTA across academic databases, institutions’ websites, public forums, and social media platforms. In addition to bibliographic information, we tracked articles, chapters, theses and dissertations, resource lists, articles on pop culture outlets and non-academic websites, and social media posts. We noted what items people were using or responding to, paying particular attention to the DTA’s accessibility for young readers and individuals unfamiliar with digital archives. We also recorded feedback from formal reviews of the DTA, particularly reviewers’ observations regarding ways to expand the project’s scope and functionality and the need to clarify some site features.</p>
<p>Reviews of the DTA and articles highlighting its usage in classrooms by <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>, and others allowed us to gain a better understanding of the site’s perceived functionality by new users. For example, Nikita Shepard’s 2020 write-up on the DTA for  <em>Reviews in Digital Humanities</em>  indicated that the function of the Map search tool was unclear, which we have attempted to resolve by providing explanatory copy above the tool. Similarly, several researchers have reported being unsure why certain outdated terms are used on the site or how to effectively search using those terms. Recognizing that the creation of metadata is a highly subjective and political act and that trans-related terminology is both personal and contextual, we describe individuals’ identities and practices using terms provided within the materials, terms known to be used by individuals represented in the materials, and, when we have no other information, terms contemporaneous to the period or culture. Since this practice influences search results in ways that may not be immediately apparent, we developed a front-facing <a href="https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/learn/searchterms">Search Tips &amp; Terms page</a> that explains how we use search terms and suggests terms for researchers to consider based on their interests.</p>
<p>Along with identifying areas for improvement, we learned a great deal about how the DTA has been used in academic research. While scholars such as <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>, and <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> analyze our practices to advocate for restorative archival projects, others use the DTA’s materials to examine public reception of trans historical figures <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> and consider the ways digital platforms permit the recirculation of early trans activism <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. Through library guides, resource lists, and teaching modules, we have also discovered that the DTA is widely recommended by teachers at colleges and universities across the United States. To better connect with our community members and share the critical resources they have compiled, we are now considering ways of highlighting research and teaching tools on our website.</p>
<p>In reviewing uptakes and usages of the DTA, it became clear that the project inspires a wealth of valuable engagement that is often overlooked by Google Alerts and other automated searches. Bearing this discovery in mind, we now dedicate lab hours at the end of each month to actively locate and record engagement to improve our understanding of users’ experiences and remain accountable to our communities’ needs.</p>
<h2 id="observation-4-social-media-underutilized">Observation #4: Social Media Underutilized</h2>
<p>Social media offers a useful tool for better connecting with potential users of the DTA, particularly those outside of academia. As <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> discusses, when adequately utilized, social media platforms for DH projects can become spaces for  “self-representation, expression or reflection and more organized forms of collaboration and knowledge building.”  The DTA maintains three social media accounts––Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Early in the audit, we determined that our social media posts had a few shortcomings: they were inconsistently published, their contents were not standardized, they varied in the amount of information provided, and they were not always fully accessible. Further, our engagement with our followers was minimal, often occurring only through responses to comments rather than proactive communication. It was unclear who our audience was or what they sought from the DTA on social media, which made it difficult to foster a sense of community on these platforms.</p>
<h2 id="response-development-of-social-media-workflow-and-style-guide">Response: Development of Social Media Workflow and Style Guide</h2>
<p>In response to these concerns, we developed a <a href="https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/about/policies">Social Media Style Guide</a> to foster more consistent and effective use of our social media presence across all three platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram). To create this guide, we evaluated platform-specific analytics to identify our audience’s demographics and track trends in post engagement. Next, we reviewed each platform’s accessibility guidelines and discussed ways to ethically present materials addressing discrimination and trauma. These data points allowed us to begin posting more accessible content (e.g., providing alternate text to describe images, using CamelCase for hashtags) that was better tailored to the interests of our social media communities. We also shifted the timing of our posts to our followers’ peak activity hours and developed a list of important annual dates to ensure that we commemorate events important to our work. Because some of our materials discuss violence and discrimination, the Social Media Style Guide includes best practices for content warnings.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a collaborative archive that relies upon the labor of countless individuals and organizations, we wanted to make sure we were consistently crediting our partnering institutions on social media posts, directing traffic to their websites and social media presences as well as our own, and calling attention to exciting new projects. Therefore, we created policies for citing the sources of our content and began sharing more posts about the archives and websites that inspire us.</p>
<p>Given that physical archives can be uniquely inaccessible to trans people, we have found that social media is one additional way we can ensure that we are reaching the people whose histories are the focus of our work. Already, we are seeing positive responses to these changes, including higher rates of post engagement, increased site traffic originating from social media, and more consistent responses from our communities. Our Social Media Style Guide functions as a living document that we continually revise as we receive feedback and track usage. By formalizing social media policies while retaining space for further experimentation, we are now better able to create informative outreach content that is consistent with our goals and ethical commitments.</p>
<h2 id="observation-5-static-pages-neglected">Observation #5: Static Pages Neglected</h2>
<p>Since the driving mission behind the DTA is making trans-related history more accessible, we have a strong commitment to ensuring that our website content is welcoming and functional for as many of our visitors as possible, irrespective of their academic background or level of experience with archival research. While the majority of our day-to-day work is focused on developing and expanding the database itself, there are a series of static pages on the site that serve as important features of the project. These include “About” pages explaining the history of the project, our team and board, and our policies, as well as “Learn” pages that offer a starter’s guide to the DTA, a race and ethnicity research guide, a glossary, and a list of global terms. Many of these pages were created in the early stages of the project and have not been consistently updated.</p>
<p>As new team members, Roles and Schlotterback brought fresh perspectives on the project, and they conducted a comprehensive reading and analysis of our website copy and images. They were specifically focused on consistency, accuracy, intellectual accessibility, and user experience. Their review ultimately determined that while we were generally successful at presenting our content in an easy-to-navigate format with a style and tone that was appropriate for a generalist audience, there were significant inconsistencies across our static pages, including some content that was concerningly outdated.</p>
<h2 id="response-creation-of-a-static-page-style-guide-and-revision-of-copy">Response: Creation of a Static Page Style Guide and Revision of Copy</h2>
<p>Identifying the areas of our static pages that needed further development led to a number of changes. Some of the edits were quite simple, such as fixing typos and broken links. Yet even such minor changes pointed to the need to clarify our editorial practices. To eliminate inconsistencies in grammar and terminology, we devised and implemented a <a href="https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/about/policies">Style Guide</a> for the DTA’s copy. Though we decided to defer to the AP Style Book for many stylistic decisions, we collectively established best practices for the specificities of writing about sex and gender, topics often neglected by mainstream style guides.</p>
<p>To better facilitate user engagement with the various functions on the DTA site, we developed explanatory and instructional copy for certain features, such as the Map tool. Among the front-facing pages of the DTA, we identified a number of areas that required more sustained care, such as the <a href="https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/learn/glossary">Glossary</a> and <a href="https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/learn/terms">Global Terms</a> pages. Rather than attempting a short-term, superficial revision during the first phase of the audit, the Glossary was significantly expanded by Roles and Schlotterback during the spring 2021 semester. In addition to revising existing definitions to better represent the complexities of trans experiences, Roles and Schlotterback identified a number of new terms to define, including the most commonly used words in DTA materials’ subject coverage, as well as historical terms like female impersonators and masquerading that are less familiar to present-day readers. As we highlight in the introduction of the revised Glossary, our goal in defining these terms is not to prescribe a single, correct definition, but to clarify how the DTA understands and uses terms throughout the project. We view this page as a living document that will be revised and expanded upon as needed, and we encourage DTA visitors to offer suggestions for terms to add or clarify. As of this writing, revision of the Global Terms page is ongoing.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The five observations and responses discussed above capture the key results of our year-long audit of the Digital Transgender Archive. The results of our audit have already proven to be tremendously insightful. In brief, we accomplished the following: our project scope has been critically analyzed and we have identified areas for intentional growth moving forward; more of our project documentation is written and publicly available; our project values have been articulated and shared; many of our static pages have been significantly revised; our social media presence is now more consistent and purposeful; we have more qualitative and quantitative user data to include in our grants; and we directly responded to reviews and feedback on the project.</p>
<p>We have shared these results in the hopes that our observations resonate with other project teams and their work. Irrespective of the specific outcomes, we found the process of auditing the DTA to be a highly effective time investment for a project that had passed through the startup phase and was just beginning to settle into ongoing maintenance. While there is always some pressure to innovate and expand, spending most of our year auditing our work allowed us the space for genuine self-evaluation so that we can now move forward with clearer intention and purpose.</p>

<p>As a project executed during a pandemic, our audit of the DTA was a completely digital process (in fact, the three of us have still never met together in person). Since we were unable even to consider whether it was desirable to establish a dedicated lab on the Northeastern campus, we instead built a “digital lab,” both to facilitate work and to foster stronger team relationships and communication. We worked entirely over digital platforms, including Zoom, Slack, Google Workspace, and the DTA website itself.&#160;<a href="#fnref:15" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Although name authority records often list variations of individuals’ names that they may have been known by or used throughout their life, these variations are controlled under a single uniform name and only the authorized name is displayed in a record.

The poem’s length prevents human readers from reading it completely. I argue that although the poem’s global inaccessibility raises complex interpretive problems, we can surmount them by applying multiple interpretive modes to a single textual fragment, thereby meeting the fragmentary text with a fragmented critical discourse; the idea being that a more coherent theoretical apparatus would, in its latent totalizing impulse, be intrinsically unsuited to a fragment’s incompleteness. I use this technique to read  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  through various lenses including,  <em>inter alia</em> , cosine similarity, affect theory, and code. I conclude with a website that reimagines the poem by populating its sea with language from the critical literature on the poem. Like  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> , this website cannot be circumnavigated by human readers and so enacts this article’s solution to the problem of how to read computational poems that cannot be read completely: to interrogate the assumptions that cause us to view unreadability as a problem, and to embrace incompleteness as a source of critical insight.</p>
<h2 id="approaching-a-whole-through-a-part-of-its-parts">Approaching a whole through a part of its parts</h2>
<p>Against a light blue background — a visual metonym for the titular sea —  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  consists of an  “immense lattice of stanzas”  that combine the  “distinguishing textual rhythms and rhetorical gestures of Melville and Dickinson”   <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The stanzas are comprised of a subset of the union of the words in Herman Melville’s  <em>Moby-Dick</em>  and Emily Dickinson’s poetry. The words are combined and recombined by the poem’s code in a manner that moves the language back and forth between the compressed interiority of Dickinson’s poetry and the expansive intensity of Melville’s prose. The poem’s words flicker and change as the reader’s mouse navigates the sea, like the water disturbed by a prow moving through waves. At the bottom of the screen is a search bar, where the reader can enter coordinates to move to a specific location in the sea; each stanza in  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  has, and is locatable by, two unique coordinates, which Montfort and Strickland conceptualize as latitude and longitude. The set of latitude and longitude values both range from 0–14992382 inclusive, meaning that the total number of stanzas is 1499238222.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>To write that  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>   consists of a stanza-lattice is slightly misleading. This is partly because the word’s Latin root means  “to stand still or firm,”  yet the critical literature on  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  repeatedly emphasizes the poem’s instability.</p>

<p>Mainly, however, consists is misleading because the poem is impossible to read completely and, by extension, the reader cannot definitively identify the poem’s constituent parts. (By  “impossible to read completely”  I mean  “impossible for a human to read completely” ; a sufficiently advanced computer could parse the entire poem.) The poem is impossible to read because of its scale. Montfort and Strickland write:  “ <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>   is a poetry generator which defines a space of language populated by a number of stanzas comparable to the number of fish in the sea, around 225 trillion”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Its order of magnitude is therefore 1014, a length that makes  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  a nexus between one of poetry’s oldest genres (epic) and one of its newest (computational poetry), though here the  <em>nostos</em>  is incompletable and the hero, if there is one, is anonymous. To use the Melvillean language that the poem invites, its length transforms the reader into an Ahab surrogate, and the text into an analogue of the white whale, though the pursuit of the latter by the former is indefinitely prolonged because, as Stuart Moulthrop and Justin Schumaker write, a  “complete reading”  of the poem  “would take more than 200 million years”   <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. To appreciate the Sisyphean nature of reading  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  more fully, observe that a reader who has read 225 stanzas has only read 1e-10% of the poem. Given the impossibility of completely reading  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> , then, the question becomes whether it is possible (and if so, how) to extrapolate an accurate sense of the poem’s architectonic whole from its fragments. Although reconstructing the lost general from the extant particular is a common task in disciplines such as archaeology, it is an alien task to the readers of contemporary poetry, where the dominant genre, lyric, is characterized by structural intelligibility (because lyric poems are conventionally brief). Moreover, as Joseph Frank writes,  “modern poetry asks its readers to suspend the process of individual reference temporarily until the entire pattern of internal references can be apprehended as a unit”   <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. But in texts with largely unfathomable (because unfathomably large) referential patterns, this process of referential suspension is drastically extended, which effectively makes it impossible to a apprehend  “the entire pattern of internal references”   <sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. In such cases, Stuart Moulthrop asks, how  “do we choose configurations of output to serve as representations of the work or objects of study?”   <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. One way of answering Moulthrop’s question is to look to classical studies. Due to the fragmentary state of much of the Greco-Roman corpus, classicists have also had to confront the question of how to interpret splinters of output from inaccessible signifiers. Although the separation of classical textual parts from their original wholes is due to the historical vicissitudes of textual transmission, whereas the separation of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> ’s parts from its whole is due to a contingent aesthetic decision by its author-programmers, the consequences are identical: our tacit assumptions about what it means for a text to be complete are foregrounded, and we are compelled to explore new modes of interpretation and reading. Because  “fragmentation . . . hinders our understanding of . . . narrative structure, particularly our ability to form any critical reading of it”   <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, these new modes must be open-ended. And, as Susan Stephens argues, because hypotheses about the relationship between a fragment and its whole are intrinsically non-falsifiable, critics are  “grant[ed] considerable latitude . . . for interpretation,”  which results in an  “almost open-ended hermeneutic environment”   <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Editing fragments, she suggests, should therefore be conducted along subjunctive lines as a  “negotiation, an exploration of the possibilities rather than the transmission of dogma”   <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Stephens’s emphasis on interpretive plurality is representative of a theoretical shift in the criticism of classical fragments. The  “standard scholarly practise,”  S. Rebecca Martin and Stephanie Langin-Hooper write,  “was to understand them [i.e., fragments] as incomplete things, whose principal purpose was to serve as a referent to a complete . . . whole”   <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Increasingly, however, fragments are being valued as texts and objects  “in their own right”  (ibid.), rather than as the offcuts of an absent signifier, especially because fragments implicitly eschew the totalizing impulse of conventional representational modes such as naturalism, and thereby allow us to explore alternative modes that embrace incompleteness (ibid., 10). Because fragments eschew totalities in favor of the partial, the criticism of fragments can switch between multiple perspectives to an extent that, in other critical contexts, could be condemned as insufficiently rigorous. The benefit of thinking about  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  through the lens of fragmentation, then, is that the poem’s main theoretical challenge (how to  “choose configurations of output to serve as representations of the work”   <sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>) dissolves because the work’s unreadability transforms from an insoluble problem into an invitation to critical multiplicity.</p>
<p>I accept this invitation by exploring  _Sea and Spar Between _ through several interpretive modes. I argue that because fragments encourage us to move between different critical paradigms, we end up looking at them from various perspectives; ironically, therefore, we can see the fragment more completely than we could have had it been possible to view against the contextual backdrop of its whole.</p>

<p>One possible response to the overwhelming complexity of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  at the macro-level is to focus on its more intelligible micro-levels. For example, we could begin at an arbitrary stanza and interpret it in relation to its local context to create a cluster of significance, treating the poem as a kind of jigsaw puzzle with the conceptually inverted aim of disassembling the completed set into sub-sets of related pieces.</p>
<p>Let us test this approach. Assume for the sake of argument that the reader has pseudo-randomly entered the poem at the coordinates (22, 22):   fix upon the bag-disk course  nailed to the spar  fast-fish  arrestless bank and rise</p>

<p>We can view (22, 22) through several different paradigms. For example, as a hub from which spokes of stanzas radiate outwards, or as the temporary midpoint of a conveyor belt of stanzas paratactically related to one another, or as a volta signalling a pivot in thought or pitch that divides the stanzas of the upper half from those of the lower, or as an element in an n-tuple. Of course, these examples do not exhaust the possible perspectives we might adopt. As Barry Stroud writes,  “The only limitation on possible conceptual schemes is our limited ingenuity in inventing them”  (1975, 92). But before selecting one of the above paradigms to apply to (22, 22) and its local context, the limits of that context have to be determined. How many of the stanzas in Figure 2 should we read? (There are three obvious possibilities: first, every stanza depicted within Figure 2, second, the row or column within which (22, 22) appears, third, (22, 22)  <em>tout court</em> .) For if we want to focus on  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> ’s textual micro-levels, then we must decide how to partition the poem into micro-levels. And unless we choose to read each stanza as if it were  <em>sui generis</em>  and therefore completely unrelated to its neighbours, then our chosen micro-level must allow for the grouping of interrelated stanzas and the mapping of relationships between stanza-groups. The problem, in a nutshell, is that it is not immediately clear how to accomplish this.</p>
<p>These groups should be discrete insofar as the point of collapsing  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  into micro-levels is to create a set of sub-poems that are feasibly interpretable in isolation, as opposed to stanzas that are interpretively dependent on their connections to stanzas around them, and the stanzas situated concentrically beyond those stanzas, and so on for some indefinite distance. So, the partitioning of stanzas will ideally be based on a system that we can use to distinguish nonarbitrary points at which one set of related stanzas ends and another begins. For example, we might group stanzas together based on linguistic-thematic coherence. The difficulty with formulating a partitioning system and applying it to  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  is that the gradation of the poem’s language is exceptionally fine; textual elements from one stanza bleed subtly into its neighbouring stanzas, whereupon they are minutely calibrated before bleeding into a neighbouring stanza’s neighbouring stanza, and so on. Variation occurs gradually and delicately, much like oceanographic variation between different bodies of water, making it difficult to identify points at which to nonarbitrarily separate groups of stanzas.</p>
<p>For example, consider Figure 3. It depicts each stanza from Figure 2 as a circle or circular segment — with each stanza’s constituent words extending outwards from, and placed at equidistant points around, its respective circle’s circumference — scattered at random points upon a rectangle. Note that each coordinate is represented as an integer: (24, 22), for example, becomes 2422. The impression, bearing in mind that the placement of the circles is random and therefore that imbrication does not imply relatedness, is of a set of atomic stanzas. The most sensible textual micro-level against which to align one’s reading of the stanzas depicted here, then, appears to be each stanza in and of itself. It is difficult to see, judging from Figure 3 alone, how one might nonarbitrarily connect, say, the stanzas at (24, 21) and (23, 20). But when this process is repeated (see Figure 4), with the crucial adjustment of diagramming word  <em>types</em> , not word  <em>tokens</em> , the set of twenty stanzas is replaced by a set of three stanzas.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> In other words, once the reader has read three of the twenty stanzas (i.e., 15% of the stanzas), they will have read every word type that appears in the stanza-rectangle; the remaining 85% of text consists solely of permutations of the tokens of those types. Figure 4 thus illustrates that the stanzas within the rectangle are much more similar than Figure 3 suggests. The task of nonarbitrarily splitting the set of stanzas into subsets therefore becomes more difficult because as similarity increases, so too does the temptation to leave the entire set  <em>in situ</em>  as a textual micro-level in and of itself. This point can also be illustrated mathematically, and I want to do so to underscore the extraordinary extent to which  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  is indivisible, before considering what interpretive purchase this indivisibility affords us.</p>
<h2 id="a-mathematical-illustration-of-sea-and-spar-betweens-interconnectedness">A mathematical illustration of Sea and Spar Between’s interconnectedness</h2>
<p>Let us examine a rectangle, with vertices located at the coordinates (100, 109), (104, 109), (104, 90), and (100, 90), that contains 100 stanzas. And let us place those stanzas within a term vector model. Say we have a stanza S that is part of a group of stanzas GS located in vector space VS. The number of dimensions in VS equals the number of unique words (W) in GS. So, VS = {W1, W2, …, Wn}. And in VS, S = {wS1, wS2, …, wSn}, where wSn represents the weight of Wn in S, where the weight is a number that, in this case, is defined by how often Wn appears in S. For example, if Ishmael were the 7th word in VS and occurred 5 times in S, then wS7 = 5. Repeating this process for every stanza in GS for every word in VS would result in a sparse matrix like the one depicted in Table 1.</p>

<p>Each stanza can then be represented as a vector in  <em>n</em> -dimensional space. For example, consider the following document-term matrix where the rows represent two hypothetical texts that can only use two words (dog and cat), and the columns represent the frequency of those words:<br>
Dog frequency  Cat frequency      Text one  2  2      Text two  10  8   <br>
Document-term matrices can be represented in vector space by assigning each term a separate axis, and by letting the frequency of each term equal the corresponding coordinate value. For example, if we let the x-axis stand for cat and the y-axis stand for dog in the below vector space, then text one will be located at (2, 2) and text two will be located at (8, 10):</p>

<p>Once texts are represented in vector space, we can calculate their similarity. Although the above vectors are relatively dissimilar in terms of Euclidean distance (vector magnitude), the angle they form is acute and they are therefore similar in terms of vector orientation (which is intuitive, insofar as both documents are comprised of the same words and differ only with respect to the frequency of those words). Vector orientation is the better measurement of document similarity in vector space. For example, though one might assume that if term z appears more frequently in document x than in document y by a factor of ten, then x is more concerned with z than y, document x might simply be ten times larger than document y, in which case both documents would be equally related (proportionally) to the topic denoted by term z (assuming z is not polysemous). Vector orientation reflects this kind of isomorphism better than vector magnitude. The cosine of the angle that two vectors form is one way to measure text similarity. As the cosine of the angle between two vectors approaches 1 (cos(θ) = 0°), the texts those vectors represent will theoretically be more similar. As the cosine approaches 0 (cos(θ) = 90°) the texts will theoretically be less similar. As the cosine approaches -1 (cos(θ) = 180°) the texts will theoretically be more opposite. I took the 100 stanzas located within the above stanza-rectangle, computed each stanza’s cosine similarity to every other stanza, and exported the results to a spreadsheet, which can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/moona740/Nat_Moore_MA_Thesis/blob/master/cosinebagofwords%20(1).xlsx">https://github.com/moona740/Nat_Moore_MA_Thesis/blob/master/cosinebagofwords%20(1).xlsx</a>. Note that the minimum cosine similarity between two stanzas here is 0, not -1, because the algorithm I used is based on term frequency (how often a word appears in a document, operating under the assumption that if two texts share a roughly similar vocabulary, and the frequency distribution of that vocabulary is also roughly similar, then they are roughly alike) and a word cannot appear &lt; 0 times in a text. The cells highlighted in red are those that show a cosine similarity between 0.7 and 0.99 inclusive. There are 3046 cells in this range. But this figure does not tell us the number of  <em>unique</em>  instances of cosine similarities between 0.7 and 0.99 because cosine similarity calculation is based on multiplication (the cosine of two vectors is essentially their scalar product divided by their length product), which is commutative. In other words, the spreadsheet (E) equals its own transpose (E = ET); the value of the cell at row x and columny is identical to the cell at rowy and columnx. So, to find the number of  <em>unique</em>  instances of cosine values in the desired range, we need to divide 3046 in half, resulting in a quotient of 1523. A rectangle with 100 stanzas has 10,000 ordered pairs of stanzas.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  This means that 15.23% of the stanzas within the rectangle highly resemble (linguistically and thematically), at least one other stanza also therein. What interpretive purchase does this data give us? It reemphasizes that even relatively distant stanzas within the poem’s stanza-lattice are similar. For example, the first stanza within the rectangle has a cosine similarity of 0.8198 with the 99th stanza. The second stanza has a cosine similarity of 0.8421 with the 94th stanza. The 76th stanza has a cosine similarity of 0.9474 with the 35th stanza. These similarities complicate attempts to sculpt the poem into discrete micro-levels because they show that there is a low correlation between Euclidean distance and linguistic-thematic gradation. Reading the stanza-rectangle is therefore complicated because it is less a stanza-rectangle than a stanza-web, with a practically infinite number of interconnecting strands. For example, if we took our previous stanza-web and stretched it from 100 stanzas to 1000 stanzas (an increase of 900%), the number of ordered pairs would increase from 10,000 to 1,000,000 (an increase of 9900%, which is an example of the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the problems that occur when interpreting data in high dimensional spaces). If roughly 15.23% of these ordered pairs were also significantly like at least one other stanza in the same web, then we would be left with the infeasibly large figure of 152,300 highly related stanza-pairs to read.</p>
<h2 id="a-possible-objection-considered-and-refuted-through-the-relativity-of-scale">A possible objection considered and refuted through the relativity of scale</h2>
<p>One might make a reasonable objection here. Why is our inability to reduce the above stanza-web to smaller micro-levels a problem? It is already a micro-level in and of itself (if we ignore the 10,000 ordered pairs contained therein); 100 stanzas are not unmanageably large. Why not simply analyze those 100 stanzas, instead of brooding about how to make ever finer calibrations? After all, most literary scholarship on long texts rest on generalizations, which themselves rest on mobilized inferences from delimited, if carefully selected, parts.</p>
<p>The answer to this objection returns us to the poem’s size and revolves around what J. H. Prynne terms  “the principle of  <em>scale</em>  and its working in poetical composition,”  by which he means that  “very small, local details can point to and complicate very large ideas or features of argument”   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. By extension, Prynne argues, we can use small textual data as  “primary instruments to think with, to uncover and investigate connections that can extend far beyond their immediate occurrence”   <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. As a kind of proof of concept, Prynne proceeds to use a single word (incense) as an interpretive key with which to unlock  <em>Paradise Lost</em> . There is nothing in Prynne’s analysis to suggest that he believes the inferential movement from the small to the large is a heuristic that should be limited to the analysis of Miltonic texts. It seems fair to assume that Prynne subscribes to a literary version of quantum entanglement.  “Two quantum-entangled particles . . . can be arbitrarily separated in space whilst remaining interdependent with respect to their measurable properties, such that a change in one will invariably be accompanied by a change in the other,”  writes William M. R. Simpson <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. If we replace particles with signifiers then we have a gloss of Prynne’s vision of the poetic connection between the local and the global.</p>
<p>The problem for us is that  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> ’s scale puts even the local out of reach. One concordance of  <em>Paradise Lost</em>  puts its total word count at 82, 860 (Matsuoka n.d.), and one incense token therefore comprises 0.00120685493% of Milton’s epic. Implicitly, Prynne believes that 0.001% of a text is an adequate tool to  “uncover and investigate connections that can extend far beyond their immediate occurrence”   <sup id="fnref2:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Perhaps, then, we should content ourselves with reading 0.00120685493% of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  and dismiss our inability to read the entire poem. But recall that the algorithm generates 1499238322 stanzas. 0.00120685493% of 1499238322 stanzas, rounded to the nearest integer, is two billion, seven hundred twelve million, six hundred sixty-six thousand, five hundred thirty-two stanzas. At my normal reading speed, I can read about twelve stanzas of the poem in one minute. I would thus require roughly 43 years to read 0.00120685493% of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> . And even if I did devote my life to this quixotic task, I could not take what I had read and  “trace its . . . echoes and ambiguities of reference across the entire poem,”  as Prynne does with the word incense, for the simple reason that I would still have another 99.9987931451% of the poem to read before I could do so. Readers of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  cannot use the  “small to illustrate or endorse the large,”  as Prynne does with  <em>Paradise Lost</em> . They are restricted to using fragments to speculate about the poem’s largeness.</p>
<h2 id="an-alternative-method-to-fulfil-our--obligation-toward-the-difficult-whole">An alternative method to fulfil our  “obligation toward the difficult whole.”</h2>
<p>In summary,  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  resists division into subsets because its interconnectedness makes it difficult to identify exactly where to nonarbitrarily split its macro-level into different micro-levels. Even if  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  did explicitly encourage textual partitioning, subsequent partitions would have to be exceptionally minute to be feasibly readable, and they would therefore have little extrapolative value. Prynne’s principle of scale —  “that very small, local details can point to and complicate very large ideas or features of argument”  — is ultimately subordinate to the principle of meta-scale because the micro-level of a very large macro-level makes a mockery of its prefix: 1% of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> , for example, is two trillion, two-hundred fifty million stanzas. Consequently, to use the words of Aristotle,  “as the eye cannot take it all in at once, the unity and sense of the whole is lost for the spectator”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, and readers are therefore restricted to conjecture, using whatever they can glean from the poem’s fragments, when questions are raised about the poem as a totality. The poem’s readers, then, have little choice but to resemble those critics who Brian McHale censures for staking their arguments on apparently key pieces of text, which are subsequently treated as  “interpretive centres . . . around which to organize . . . heterogenous material”   <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. Poems thus interpreted, McHale argues, are  “reduced, in effect, to a skeletal structure of points that yield most readily to a particular interpretive orientation”   <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.  “This strategy,”  McHale writes, leads to the reduction of a poem to a  “collection of decontextualized  key  quotes,”  and, as a result,  “the bulk of the poem goes uninterpreted — unread, to all intents and purposes”   <sup id="fnref2:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. The difference is that the bulk of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  is not unread  “to all intents and purposes,”  but literally unreadable; the reader’s reliance on fragments of text is an imposed and unavoidable constraint, not a culpable failure to meet what McHale calls  “the obligation toward the difficult whole”   <sup id="fnref3:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. I write imposed as a reminder that Montfort and Strickland have deliberately thwarted the possibility of understanding the poem’s whole by restricting readers to a virtually endless series of fragmentary parts. We are thus forced to navigate the text in a manner reminiscent of the  <em>Pequod</em> ’s peripatetic voyage (our search for stable textual meaning is therefore ambiguously conflated with Ahab’s dangerous and arguably pointless obsession), and the conventional tools of close reading, as we have seen, cannot help us upon this voyage.</p>
<p>However, denying critics the opportunity to close read  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  as a totality might ultimately be an act of critical generosity if, as David Ciccoricco argues, the  “trouble”  with  “second generation digital-literary criticism . . . [is] the celebration of both the practice and the very possibility of close reading works [of] digital literature, while at the same time failing to adequately articulate what  close reading  means, or must come to mean, in digital environments”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. For by making it impossible to close read  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> , Montfort and Strickland not only make it  <em>a fortiori</em>  impossible to celebrate the practise or possibility of close reading  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> , but also compel critics to articulate how close reading must evolve if it is to have any relevant applications to overwhelmingly distant computational texts.</p>
<p>What we need is a close reading of close reading. One place from which we might draw inspiration for this task is the criticism of classical textual fragments. Here, I argue, we can find a set of provisional, flexible principles that work with, rather than against, the fragmentation of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> . According to the translator Diane Rayor, one such principle is the resolution to make textual lacunae evoke  “connections,”  not  “absences,”  which thereby enables readers  “to bridge the gap”  between a fragment and its absent whole (quoted by <a href="#balmer2013">Balmer [2013], 50</a>). In the remaining sections of this article, I attempt to invest the fragments of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  with significance by meeting them with an equally fragmentary array of alternatives to close reading (for example, the mode I turn to next concentrates upon the reader’s affectual experience of the poem). In doing so, I suggest that the best way to interpret a text that always already comes to us in fragmented form is not only through  <em>using</em>  the fragment as an organizing critical trope, but also through the mimetic  <em>making</em>  of new interpretive fragments.</p>
<h2 id="from-the-sublime-to-the-stuplime">From the sublime to the stuplime</h2>
<p>In  “The Brain — is wider than the Sky —,”  Emily Dickinson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Brain is deeper than the sea —   For — hold them — Blue to Blue —   The one the other will absorb —   As sponges — Buckets — do —<br>
<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Montfort and Strickland invert this relationship: the poem’s sea is deeper than the reader’s brain, which cannot absorb the blue to which it is, paradoxically, both parallel (grammatically) and incommensurate (spatially). We have seen that conventional close reading is ill-suited to circumventing the challenges that this inversion poses. I want now to examine a mode of reading that may be better suited to the vastness of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> . It is the mode that each of the poem’s authors recommend (for now, we will reserve judgement as to whether this counts in the mode’s favour or against it), though their recommendations differ on a subtle but profound point. We can therefore add Montfort and Strickland to the list of oppositions (e.g., sea and spar, Melville and Dickinson, longitude and latitude) that cumulatively entrench juxtaposition as one of the poem’s central structural principles. First I want to address Montfort’s recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not consider that readers will often seek out particularly apt stanzas and wish to return to them. While returning to a favorite stanza is possible in our system, it may seem a curious quest . . . . For some readers, the experience of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  will occur rather in the texture, operation, and journey of reading the work as it presents itself, rather than in any particular destination. Finding the free experience of reading to be better than the saving of coordinates, they will soon be Done with the Compass – – / Done with the Chart!<br>
<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After conceptual poetry’s assault on the Coleridgean definition of poetry as the best words in the best order, and on the high modernist values of originality and verbal mastery, it is only somewhat of a surprise to read a poet predict that their readers will prioritize texture over text. But it becomes more surprising when we recognize that Montfort’s quote is from one of Dickinson’s most anthologized poems,  “Wild Nights — Wild Nights!”  The decision to use an acclaimed poem to buttress the thesis that  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> ’s stanzas are fungible is, at best, dissonant; quoting apt words to promote the interpretive equivalent of drifting at sea is potentially self-defeating. For it might make us ask why a text that is purportedly a homage to Dickinson’s poetry would meet certain distinctive features of her oeuvre — originality, concision, and concentration of meaning — antithetically with repetition, prolix, and dispersal of meaning. But we should be cautious of this question because were we to truly ask it, then we would move beyond the textual analysis of particularly apt stanzas to the meta-textual analysis of texture, operation, and journey, which would leave us uncritically obeying Montfort’s interpretive vision in a manner reminiscent of some of the more obsequious crew members of the  <em>Pequod</em> . Such obedience is already ubiquitous. The critical responses to  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  (not excluding my own) are marked on the one hand by little to no discussion about individual stanzas, and on the other by prolonged discussion about the poem as a whole, or rather on the impossibility of discussing the poem as a whole (see <a href="#moulthrop2016">Moulthrop and Schumaker [2016]</a>; <a href="#aquilina2017">Aquilina [2017]</a>; <a href="#lecor2018">Le Cor [2018]</a>; <a href="#moulthrop2018">Moulthrop [2018]</a>). But one person who does not entirely agree with the paradigm of reading that Montfort advocates is the figure from whom one would least expect divergence: his co-author. Strickland writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrative fails if you can’t know beginning or end, even if you do know extent. But resonance does not . . . . In the 21st century a single stanza from 225, _ or from 225 trillion_ , equally, may resonate, even with meme-like force. And this impression will vary depending on how you happen to, and/or choose to contextualize it within wider swaths or waves of reading. There can be no anticipation of an outcome, only registration of it.<br>
<sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Montfort’s assertion that  “we do not consider that readers will often seek out particularly apt stanzas and wish to return to them”  contradicts Strickland’s assertion that any one of the poem’s stanzas might  “resonate . . . with meme-like force,”  because readers of poetry typically return to resonant stanzas. This contradiction is surprising because Montfort’s we, unless it is royal, implies consensus. Further shattering the illusion of consensus, Montfort’s emphasis on the singular (texture as opposed to textures,   <em>mutatis mutandis</em>  for operation and journey) implies that the poem is a vehicle for a single affect. Yet Strickland’s emphasis on plurality (expressed in the language of the consumer warning: this impression will vary) implies that the reader can autonomously dictate the text’s affectual impact because they can choose to contextualize their impressions within wider . . . waves of reading. The contradiction seems intractable. On the one hand, how can a poem that is so formally and conceptually excessive play host to only one affect? But on the other, how could a poem so overwhelmingly large fail to overwhelm the reader, and how could this irresistible devastation of attention not be the poem’s sole texture? The answer is that both are correct at different points in time. Strickland is initially correct, and then, after an indefinite period, the varying impressions that underlie her vision of the registration of experience degenerate to a single texture: fatigue.</p>
<p>Strickland’s prediction that  “there can be no anticipation of an outcome, only registration of it”  recalls Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s small water-insect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of my readers will have observed a small water-insect on the surface of rivulets . . . how the little animal wins its way up against the stream, by alternate pulses of active and passive motion, now resisting the current, and now yielding to it in order to gather strength . . . . This is no unapt emblem of the mind’s self-experience in the act of thinking.<br>
  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I have been calling Strickland’s prediction also functions as a prescription, and what it prescribes is prioritizing the mind’s self-experience in the act of reading over the act of reading. In  “The Function of Criticism at the Present Time,”  Matthew Arnold praises the self-scrutiny of Edmund Burke ( “that return of Burke upon himself”   <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>); Strickland similarly endorses the reader’s return upon themselves as an object of critical reflection. In doing so, she reenacts the so-called affective turn by turning to the reader’s affective experience as a productive theoretical lens. (The affective turn names a growing fascination with affect in the social sciences and humanities. It is difficult to be more precise because  “affect theory is a notoriously diffuse area of study,”  which lacks  “any generally agreed definition of the central object”   <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. However, the key idea is that humans are  “imbued with subliminal affective intensities that . . . decisively influence or condition our political and other beliefs”   <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. Affect theory is grounded in these  “affective intensities”  and their entanglement with discursive forces.) Affect theory, at first glance, seems a promising way of overcoming the poem’s expansion of scale by situating the effects of that expansion in an inversely  <em>contracted</em>  locus: the reader’s body. Because, regardless of a text’s inscrutability, readers can always scrutinize their own subjective feelings (granted the Cartesian presumption that individuals have secure and privileged access to the first-person phenomenal realm, which is open to debate: see <a href="#srinivason2015">Srinivasan [2015]</a>). Even if a text is hostile to intellectual assimilation, the reader’s conscious affective response to that hostility is,  <em>ceteris paribus</em> , still assimilable. So, although  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  seems affectively recalcitrant in its overall inscrutability, that blankness and closure invite an affective response, and Strickland’s prediction hence begins to seem increasingly perceptive. In a zone of partially unparseable poetic meanings, she denies that the reader’s meaning-making capacity is consequently disabled. Instead, she predicts, the impulses, attitudes, and emotions provoked by an unsynthesizable text will themselves cohere into a meaningful gestalt. The poem’s effectively infinite scale is therefore met, and neutralized, by the effectively infinite range of affects available to human readers. According to the logic of Strickland’s prediction, the frustration of the reader’s capacity to make meaningful claims about the textual whole stimulates affective states; those states are meaningful; the reader’s meaning-making capacity is therefore rehabilitated; experiential registration is therefore privileged over experiential anticipation. Strickland’s impressionism is partially borne out by the reader’s short-term experiential response to the poem. The only upper limit on the quantity of these responses is the number of people who have read the poem because each will have had a unique reading experience. But once the reader realizes that they have no hope of circumnavigating the poem’s sea, the plurality of affectual responses begins to converge to a deep and relentless boredom. For the longer one reads, the less one is able to ignore the poem’s scale and its consequences, including, most notably, fatigue. At this point, Montfort’s prediction comes into effect:  “finding the free experience of reading to be better than the saving of coordinates . . . [the reader] will soon be  Done with the Compass –– / Done with the Chart! ”   <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.The phrase free experience imbues the reader’s dismissal of compass and chart with a liberating sense of  <em>amor fati</em> , which conjures images of the reader traversing the poem’s sea with insouciant disregard for the impossibility of ever reaching shore. But if we return to the poem from which Montfort extracts his concluding quotation (Dickinson’s  “Wild Nights — Wild Nights!” ), we can see that Dickinson’s speaker is only done with navigational instruments because they are immobilized, which renders such instruments superfluous:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Wild nights — Wild nights!  Were I with thee   Wild nights should be  Our luxury!      Futile — the winds —   To a Heart in port —   Done with the Compass —   Done with the Chart!      Rowing in Eden —   Ah — the Sea!  Might I but moor — tonight —   In thee!      
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Dickinson’s speaker is port-bound, and it is this confinement that inverts traditional symbols of movement (wind) and autonomous exploration (maps) to make them represent, with an almost perverse irony, their respective antitheses. Montfort’s prediction therefore resembles the sea in its concealment of its contents below a surface. Even if the reader begins to operate  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  with a unique method, or with the aim of charting an experimentally nonlinear journey, or by paying close self-referential attention to their textural experience — thereby fulfilling Montfort’s ostensible prediction — those operations, journeys, or textures will eventually contract into the texture of, and journey through, imposed determinism: the brute reality of the poem’s scale. The reader thus moves from the poem’s operator to that which is operated upon, which places their interpretive autonomy in peril. What Montfort conceals below the surface of his prediction is that each  “particular destination”  is merely a way-stop on the journey to the poem’s final destination of stupefaction, a terminus that is especially inescapable if one’s method of escape depends on  “texture, operation, and journey.”  Attempts to transcend the poem’s size-imposed uninterpretability through tactical neglect of interpretation will only manage to defer the problem of scale for an interval that is inversely correlated to the duration of the reader’s reading session. Engaging with the poem’s size is the  <em>sine qua non</em>  of prolonged engagement with the poem.</p>
<p>Having sketched how Strickland’s prediction briefly reigns, before being dethroned by Montfort’s, I want now to concretely demonstrate how this process occurs. Suppose I am about to enter  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  and have decided to focus on how I read rather than what I read. I then observe that although many critics have noted that each stanza has two coordinates (denoting longitude and latitude), the possibilities that these coordinates open up have been neglected (apart from the obvious utilitarian functionality: coordinates can be typed into a search bar to move the reader to that location). But if we let each horizontal and vertical coordinate stand for an x- and y-value, respectively, then we can map every stanza of the poem on to a Cartesian plane. For example, here are the stanzas (denoted by the green dots) from (0, 0) to (10, 10) plotted in Cartesian space:</p>

<p>Then we can read the poem geometrically by structuring our path through the text in accordance with the wave-like shape of the sine function. We can follow the wave from crest to trough and vice versa along the x-axis and note the points where the sine wave and individual stanzas intersect (because the domain of the sine function is all real numbers we could do this literally  <em>ad infinitum</em> , so the poem’s length, for once, poses no methodological problem). And then we could choose to read only those stanzas that intersect the wave, such as the stanzas at (0, 0) and (8, 1) in the above figure. Our journey through the text’s metaphorical sea would thus be determined by the movement of a sinusoidal line receding and returning along a metaphorical shore (i.e., the x-axis. Note that the x- and y-axes have now doubled their representative function. The x-axis now represents both a stanza’s horizontal coordinate and theta; the y-axis now represents a stanza’s vertical coordinate and the sine of theta). The beginning of this journey is depicted Figure 8.</p>

<p>According to the sinusoidal method outlined above, we would read 16 of the first 101 stanzas of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> . These 16 stanzas are located at the following coordinates: (0, 0), (8, 1), (14, 1), (22, 0), (33, 1), (36, -1), (44, 0), (52, 1), (58, 1), (66, 0), (74, -1), (77, 1), (80, -1), (88, 0), (96, 1), and (99, -1). What is the initial texture of the sinusoidal method? What journey does it initially take us on? These are not rhetorical questions. I invite you to answer them for yourself by following the instructions at: <a href="https://github.com/moona740/Nat_Moore_MA_Thesis/blob/master/Graph">https://github.com/moona740/Nat_Moore_MA_Thesis/blob/master/Graph</a>. But note the exertion of initial. The sinusoidal pattern of reading could stimulate hundreds of  <em>initial</em>  affectual experiences: curiosity, displeasure, mesmerisation by the sine wave’s endless oscillation between its range of [-1, 1] and so on. As Strickland correctly predicts, the reader’s  “impression will vary”   <sup id="fnref4:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. But only initially. If you have followed the above instructions, then you will know that whatever affective response the poem first provokes will, given enough time, eventually decay to a homogenous affectual experience. The critical consensus is that this experience is one of sublimity. For example, Aquilina writes that  “ “Sea and Spar Between”  . . . is a poetic experience that provokes the  sublime ”   <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>, and Hayles claims that the poem’s  “effect is a kind of technological sublime”   <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. Moreover, the editors of the third volume of the Electronic Literature Collection call  _Sea and Spar Between _ an allegory of the relationship between readers and  “a digital sublime. Montfort and Strickland demonstrate how the massive scales of computer data far exceed human phenomenology”   <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. Finally, Moulthrop and Schumaker argue that  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  explores  “a topological sublime — a level of possibility and complexity that overloads traditional cognitive structures,”  noting also that the poem  “countersigns its topological excursion with reference to an older register of the sublime,”  namely the sea, which functions as an  “image of natural immensity”   <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. But the sublime, with its Romantic connotations of awe and astonishment, is an incongruous paradigm with which to read a poem that ultimately induces overwhelming fatigue. A more appropriate aesthetic category is Sianne Ngai’s stuplime (a portmanteau of stupefaction and sublime), which she defines as  “the unusual synthesis of excitations and fatigue”  stimulated by  “encounters with vast but bounded artificial systems resulting in repetitive and often mechanical acts of enumeration, permutation and combination”   <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. According to Immanuel Kant, sublimity is experienced when an observer confronts an overwhelming whole that precipitates a sense of cognitive and perceptual inadequacy <sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. But for Kant, Ngai writes, the threat that this confrontation poses to the self is nullified when the imagination’s inability to comprehend the sublime forces the observer to fall back upon ratiocination as a last-gasp defensive mode of comprehension, whereupon reason is entrenched  “as a  <em>superior</em>  faculty — one capable of grasping the totality . . . that the imagination could not in the form of a noumenal or supersensible idea, and also of revealing the self’s final superiority to nature”   <sup id="fnref2:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. The sublime’s initial majestic power, and the analytical mind’s final victory over that majesty, makes it a poor theoretical instrument with which to interpret a text that grinds its readers down by the mundane accumulation of iterative poetic offcuts. Because, as Ngai writes, the  “initial experience of being aesthetically overwhelmed”  by such texts is one not of  “terror or pain (eventually superseded by tranquility), but  <em>something much closer to an ordinary fatigue</em>  — and one that cannot be neutralized, like the sublime’s terror, by a competing affect”   <sup id="fnref3:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. Given that  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  is one such fatigue-inducing text, its repeated theorization through the lens of sublimity has given rise to a partially false impression of its affective scope. The poem’s patient erosion of the reader’s attention span and curiosity does not  “confirm the self’s sense of superiority over the overwhelming or intimidating object”   <sup id="fnref4:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>, or cathartically dilute the terror instilled by its own enormousness. Moreover, any astonishment it provokes is tempered by the reader’s inability to read the poem in its entirety. Ngai writes that fatigue-inducing texts demand new modes of thinking about what it means to be incapacitated by aesthetic objects, on the assumption that  “radically different forms of cultural production”  call for equally radical critical responses <sup id="fnref5:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>; an assumption, incidentally, that this article questions in its use of fragmentation to interpret  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> . Stuplimity is Ngai’s answer to this call. The term names the affective interplay of fatigue (stupefaction) and awe (sublimity) that promises, but perpetually falls just short of delivering, an aesthetic denouement. We can see this stuplimic interplay in the language of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> , where a mere 268 words combine to form 225 trillion stanzas; a contradictory mixture of linguistic poverty and wealth that ultimately results, to borrow Ngai’s description of a prose-poem by Samuel Beckett,  “in a language that is paradoxically both ascetic and congested,  thickening  even as it progresses into a narrative of not-progressing”   <sup id="fnref6:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. The reader therefore succumbs to the fatigue caused by the felt absence of propulsive linear narrative or hierarchical sequence, which culminates, if that is the word, in an  “indeterminate affective state that lacks the punctuating  point  of an individuated emotion”   <sup id="fnref7:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that the mode of reading recommended by Montfort and Strickland is one that engineers an inescapable transfer of stupor from text to reader. Yet  “by pointing to what obstructs aesthetic or critical response,”  Ngai writes, the stuplime — much like the fragment —  “prompt[s] us to look for new strategies of affective engagement and to extend the circumstances under which engagement become possible”   <sup id="fnref8:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. The poem’s title hints at an alternative strategy of affective engagement.  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  quietly advises the reader that when the poem entertains an apparent opposition, such as sea/spar, the binary is less important than what lies between it. For example, consider the Melville/Dickinson binary. I write above that the poem’s language moves  “back and forth between the compressed interiority of Dickinson’s poetry and the expansive intensity of Melville’s prose.”  But it is equally plausible to claim that Melville’s prose is painfully cramped in places, insofar as the  <em>Pequod</em>  is cramped (for example, the blubber-room) and Ahab is constricted by, because in thrall to, an  <em>idée fixe</em> . Similarly, one can adduce various lines of poetry to support the argument that Dickinson’s poetry is centrifugal and expansive, despite or because of her Amherst exile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Brain — is wider than the Sky —   For — put them side by side —   The one the other will contain  With ease — and you — beside —<br>
<sup id="fnref2:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can therefore disturb the equilibrium of the Melville/Dickinson opposition with surprising ease, which is evidence of the heed we should pay to the poem’s titular emphasis on betweenness when making oppositional claims. One way of respecting the title’s liminality is to examine what lies between the poem’s sea (the interface) and its spar (the various fragmentary strategies of reading that permit the reader to float upon the poem’s sea): its algorithm. Because we can read the algorithm in its entirety, it offers us a secure basis on which to speculate about the poetry that it generates. In the final section of this article, I ask whether reading the finite code that generates an effectively infinite text allows us to imagine the poem’s fragments as a cohesive whole. One might anticipate that at this point the article’s emphasis on fragmentation will itself fragment, insofar as interpreting the poem’s code involves understanding the system that structures its part/whole binary, which is very different to working with nonalgorithmic classical text-fragments. However, I show that fragmentation remains a useful heuristic not only because  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> &rsquo;s code raises more questions than it does answers (which ultimately leaves the text in an even more fragmented state), but also because I use the poem’s code to double its fragments by making a duplicate website, which exemplifies my argument that by bringing classical literary forms and modern computation into dialogue, we can instigate a conversation that its greater than the sum of its fragmentary parts.</p>

In addition to showing us the words that comprise the poem, and the structures that these words must adhere to, the code also lets us see Montfort and Strickland’s explanations of their rhetorical decisions. For example:</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Having moved from the poem, where the prospect of drowning in its textual superabundance is an ever-present threat, to the poem’s code (which, at 930 lines, is  <em>prima facie</em>  tractable), we might be tempted to assume that we are in safer waters. But that would be a mistake. For example, Montfort and Strickland write that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// The array variable shortPhrase contains short phrases, almost all of // which are taken from Melville&#39;s Moby-Dick: var shortPhrase = [&#39;circle on&#39;, &#39;dash on&#39;, &#39;let them&#39;, &#39;listen now&#39;, &#39;loop on&#39;, &#39;oh time&#39;, &#39;plunge on&#39;, &#39;reel on&#39;, &#39;roll on&#39;, &#39;run on&#39;, &#39;spool on&#39;, &#39;steady&#39;, &#39;swerve me?&#39;, &#39;turn on&#39;, &#39;wheel on&#39;, &#39;whirl on&#39;, &#39;you — too — &#39;, &#39;fast-fish&#39;, &#39;loose-fish&#39;];

Despite being told that almost all of the phrases in the  <code>shortPhrase[]</code>  array are  “taken from Melville’s  <em>Moby-Dick</em> ,”  over half (10/19) do not appear there (see <a href="#irey1982">Irey [1982]</a>).

Once again, Montfort and Strickland’s code directly contradicts their explicating comments. More broadly, the use of non-Melvillean and non-Dickinsonian language complicates Montfort and Strickland’s assertion that  “our poetry generator,   <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> , was fashioned based on Emily Dickinson’s poems and Herman Melville’s   <em>Moby-Dick</em> ”   <sup id="fnref5:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The disjunction between the authors’ self-professed process and their actual process shows that although the poem’s code seems like a ready-made solution to the many interpretive challenges that  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  poses, it ultimately raises more questions than it answers.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have argued in this article that one way of responding to the computational vastness of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  is through the lens of a distinctly pre-computational literary category: the fragment. Because fragments are cut off from their original context, they resist definitive critical judgements. Although this resistance limits what we can and cannot say about  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> , it also lets us move from one provisional and speculative critical perspective to another (we moved from close reading, to cosine similarity, to affect theory, to the sinusoidal method, to the sublime, to the stuplime, and finally, to the poem’s code), which results, paradoxically, in a more complete understanding of the poem’s fragments.</p>
<p>I want to make one final point about  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> . Montfort and Strickland write in the poem’s code that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// If someone were to replace our words and phrases with new texts, a // generator with a similar appearance and similar functioning, but with a // new vocabulary, would be defined. That is, it is practically possible to // create a new generator, a remix or appropriation of this one, by // replacing only the data in this section. If this is done and the code // is not otherwise modified, the system will assemble language in the same // way, but it will work on different language.
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p><sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, they conclude:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// The most useful critique is a new // constitution of elements. On one level, a reconfiguration of a source // code file to add comments — by the original creator or by a critic — // accomplishes this task. But in another, and likely more novel, way, // computational poetics and the code developed out of its practice // produce a widely distributed new constitution.
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p><sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>
<p>Montfort and Strickland are clearly inviting their readers to use  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  as a computational poetic template, in the same way that  <em>Taroko Gorge</em>   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> has been persistently remixed in homage to, or as a reflexive interpretation of, Montfort’s iterative poetics.</p>
<p>Figure 9 documents my acceptance of this invitation. I took the critical literature on  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  (some 20,000 words) and collated it into a text document. Then I wrote a Python script that tallied the document’s most frequent words (excluding stop words). I took the most frequent words and inserted them into the various arrays within  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em> ’s source code. I have hosted the resulting meta-critical fragments on a website that you can view at <a href="http://www.natmoore.co.nz">www.natmoore.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that somewhere within the new 225 trillion fragments of text is a line that, due to a serendipitous combination of words and insights from the hivemind of criticism that the poem has impelled, offers a novel idea that could lead the theorization of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  in particular, and combinatoric algorithmic poetry in general, in a pathbreaking direction. Of course, the odds of someone ever finding this hypothetical fragment within a figurative ocean of fragments is close to zero. But that is only fitting, given what this article has demonstrated: that a productive mode of interpreting  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  is firstly through the classical model of fragmentation, and secondly through the computational generation of new metacritical fragments. Because if we fragment a overwhelmingly large poem into a series of smaller reflexive pieces, then not only do we gain a broader, more nuanced critical perspective, but we also begin to mimetically enact the poem’s stuplimity in reverse because an expansive text and a contractive text are equally overwhelming once they expand or contract beyond the point of human comprehension. More broadly, the metacritical version of  <em>Sea and Spar Between</em>  signals the critical usefulness of replicating (as opposed to simply explicating) the source code of a computational poem; the text thereby transforms from an interpretive locus to a poetic template, and by studying the similarities and dissimilarities of the different poetic instances made by the template, we can come to a deeper understanding of the original text.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>_To be modern is to live within and by means of infrastructures _<br>
<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><br>
<em>The task for scholars of infrastructure, then, is not merely to dwell on the materiality of infrastructure — an important topic on its own right, to be sure — but to dig deeper and uncover the humans who keep things going</em> .<br>
<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><br>
Built over centuries, the scholarly infrastructure that forms the backbone of the humanities includes  “diverse collections of primary sources in libraries, archives, and museums; the bibliographies, searching aids, citation systems, and concordances that make that information retrievable; the standards that are embodied in cataloging and classification systems; the journals and university presses that distribute the information; and the editors, librarians, archivists, and curators who link the operation of this structure to the scholars who use it”   <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Since its modern inception, the infrastructure of the archive has enabled key functions required of humanities scholarship: authentication, providing researchers with an assurance of the trustworthiness of records as records; awareness, enabling a community of scholars to discover and understand needed sources; gathering, allowing scholars to build personal collections of primary source materials; contextualization, facilitating scholars in situating sources in the circumstances of creation and use; tracking, creating a means to credit the information used through the process of proper citation; and preservation, ensuring the reliable and long-term maintenance of the historical record for future generations of scholars <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the past twenty years the virtue inherent in the long-standing nature and widespread use of research infrastructures has been upended in a world in which the digital has come to the fore and the infrastructural push in the humanities is oriented to the large-scale, the new, the innovative, the future-oriented and the technologized. Initiatives such as the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and the Cultural Heritage Data Reuse Charter <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> situate archives as institutional players in the ongoing development and transformation of the humanities. Yet in analyzing the rhetoric of Our Cultural Commonwealth, a 2006 report published under the auspices of the American Council of Learned Societies to guide humanities infrastructure development in the United States, Speck and Links highlight the limited role ascribed to the archivist centered on the collection, management, and preservation of the cultural record <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. As Speck and Links <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> note, in the push to attune humanities infrastructural development with cyberinfrastructure developments in the sciences, existing relationships between scholars, archivists, and archives have generally been overlooked. Indeed, research by Poole and Garwood suggests that some scholars working on large scale data-intensive digital humanity projects are unaware or unconvinced that archivists have requisite skills on which they could draw <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. Part of the explanation for this may lie in arguments made by scholars such as Svensson who, while acknowledging the need to engage with existing infrastructural traditions, caution against extending or building uncritically on this base <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Such viewpoints seek to upend existing epistemic commitments in the humanities, whether pertaining to structure, material types, selection procedures, access and retrieval systems, or the relationship between researchers and entities such as archives <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Disrupting the institutions, systems, and professions at the heart of collection management is one way of seeking greater legitimacy for the humanities; rejecting the image of the humanities as a discipline bound to pen and paper and instead focusing on developing novel infrastructural platforms, material assemblages, intellectual agendas, modes of material engagement, and interpretive frameworks <sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Even in instances where there is a recognized lineage between the traditional and the emerging, the reimagined humanities are expansive at a scale that threatens to stretch the fabric of the already overtaxed infrastructure on which it is built <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Such an unrestrained vision for the humanities in the digital age includes the  “complete digitisation and virtual unification of the cultural record,”  along with  “universal access”  to it <sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Missing or buried in much of the recent discussion of the future of humanities infrastructure is the idea that lessons can be learned from studying extant systems; to reflect on the ways in which they have existed in use and the ways in which they have been stewarded - sustained, maintained, repaired, and remodeled - over time. Also largely missing from this discourse is the understanding that claims that the archival infrastructure is visible, knowable, and available to the humanities scholar is complicated by the act of mediation. In the digital humanities literature Speck and Links <sup id="fnref3:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> note the diminished sense of understanding of the role the archivist plays as intermediary and as mediator in the research process, with Rosenzweig <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> providing a historical grounding for the associated decoupling of the historical and archival professions. As Speck and Links discuss, inter-mediation is undertheorized in the literature on research infrastructures despite an acknowledgement that humanities research infrastructure exists within a  “complex relationship between scholar, archivist and archive”   <sup id="fnref4:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. From an archival perspective, what is lost or at best ignored in this discourse is the central and evolving role that archival information labor has played for the past one hundred years in allowing humanities infrastructure to function. In the focus on the digital we see a neglect of notions of physical space and the associated skills and knowledge that grew up around and alongside the physical archive.</p>
<p>As Downey asserts, information labor  “always takes place in, and depends on, a particular spatial/temporal and political-economic context”   <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Despite or perhaps because of its invisibility to the outside world, the nature and composition of the labor that undergirds maintenance work has recently been the focus of intense scrutiny among archival practitioners. Echoing Jackson, the archival profession has come to understand that  “questions of visibility and invisibility may be intimately linked to power”   <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. That its labor is often contingent, done by workers on temporary contracts brought in to try and diminish an ever-present backlog, highlights one set of concerns about the ethics and sustainability of the maintenance process <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. That, typical of other feminized professions, the emotional labor inherent in such work goes unrecognized, has been an additional source of tension.</p>
<p>Edwards states that  “to understand an infrastructure, you have to invert it”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. This article is a call to action to resituate the archive as a critical form of infrastructure embedded within and existing beneath the surface of academic life. The goal is to enact the archive as a form of information, knowledge, and research infrastructure; an infrastructure that science and technology scholars show is sociotechnical in nature <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. The article centers and scrutinizes the labor of the archivist as a form of infrastructural maintenance work for the humanities; a maintenance that is of the network, of the buildings, and of the collections under care. Situating the archive as a form of infrastructure and archival labor as a form of maintenance work generates descriptions of archival systems and practices that shine a spotlight on key negotiations and tensions that adhere in a profession that exists in service of an infrastructure built for others. In particular, the article and the argument therein serve as a reminder of what will be lost if the traditional infrastructure and the maintenance work of the archive is set aside rather than ported into any imagining or re-imagining of the humanities of the future.</p>
<p>Star outlines several ways that information infrastructures can be read: as material artifacts of human construction with a focus on the attendant physical and pragmatic effects; as records or traces of human activities whose artifacts can be examined as a way of unearthing associated cultural values, conflicts, points of decision making etc.; and as unproblematic, genuine, and complete representations of aspects of the world <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. In the context of this article, the emphasis is on reading archival infrastructure as a long-lived artifact, looking at the organizational complexity and the layers of control and access it supports and that affect the ways in which humanities work gets done.</p>
<h2 id="the-development-of-the-archive-as-an-information-infrastructure-and-mediator-for-knowledge-discovery">The Development of the Archive as an Information Infrastructure and Mediator for Knowledge Discovery</h2>
<p>Infrastructures are man-made facilities and resources – roads, railroads, municipal water supplies, sewers, communication networks – which produce goods and services on which the modern world relies <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Such infrastructures are said to be the  “connective tissues and the circulatory systems”  that create and co-create modernity <sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Metaphors present infrastructure as a ‘substrate,’ a material entity that is built and maintained in service of, and as a base for, the running or operation of public and private systems <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. The notion of infrastructure as an inert entity is complicated by the recognition that infrastructures are more than simply material things. As Edwards notes, infrastructures function not just as environment but also as social setting  <sup id="fnref3:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Indeed, infrastructures are understood as fundamentally relational in nature, instantiated, and given substance when a continuous and potent mix and flow of people, practice, activities, artifacts, and structures come together <sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref4:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. As a form of socio-technical assemblage or ecology, infrastructures exist within specific landscapes, having grown from an installed base, being embedded in other social structures and arrangements, and having a certain spatial and/or temporal reach. The number and complexity of socio-technical ties, coupled with the fact that it develops cumulatively over time, means that  “once set in place or in motion, infrastructures take on distinctive inertial qualities”   <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Infrastructure is also knowable in various ways - transparent and available for use, shaped by the conventions of communities of practice, and learned as part of membership in distinct groups. Yet it is often taken for granted, most visible when it is in breakdown mode and in need of repair <sup id="fnref2:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Infrastructures for research and scholarship have been around since late antiquity when the Alexandrian Mouseion housed a cultural center, university, and library. Over the centuries, developments such as the advent of scholarly disciplines, advances in the creation of taxonomies and classifications, and the diffusion of scholarly journals helped to create the bedrock infrastructure for humanities scholarship <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>. This past century has seen a boom in the development of a network of infrastructures that exist to support and sustain knowledge discovery. As Paul Edwards describes, these infrastructures exist as  “robust networks of people, artifacts, and institutions that generate, share, and maintain specific knowledge about the human and natural worlds”   <sup id="fnref2:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. This growth of knowledge and information infrastructures coincided with a period of change for higher education in the United States, one in which the model of a research university with distinct academic disciplines, and with original knowledge production at its heart, was ascendant. Looking at the more recent history of knowledge infrastructures highlights how different fields have responded to and organized around the recent call to be ‘data intensive’ <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. The rise of data archives in the twentieth century, as an exemplar, was linked to the quantification of social science disciplines, with the associated shift toward methods and data afforded more prestige in the academy <sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>. In the United States, data archives emerged on university campuses from the 1940s onwards, providing preservation and access services for social science researchers looking to conduct longitudinal, comparative, and cross-sector research with quantitative statistical data sets, at scale <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>. As an information infrastructure, data science archives are constituted by and rely on the work of agents (data processors and data curators), who reformat and clean survey data in an act of remediation as the data moves from the collection and analysis phase to one of subsequent reuse <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Archival repositories of historical knowledge form part of the essential organizing practices and information infrastructure for research dating back at least to the time of the French Revolution. As a form of research infrastructure, archives are ‘transversal’ in nature <sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>; serving numerous disciplines but seen as particularly relevant and scoped for the humanities. In the scholarly communications lifecycle, the archive (as place and as collection) is  <em>the</em>  research laboratory, the source of knowledge that underlies and supports the humanities and its sub-disciplines <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  In constituting an infrastructure for the humanities, the archive is viewed as substrate, situated in a support role for the research agenda of others. This manifestation follows earlier instantiations of the role of the archive through history – the paradigm of the palace archives of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the archive as the treasure chest of legally valuable records of the medieval period, and the archive as a tool for political administration and keeper of government (state) authority as manifested in the state chanceries and record-keeping systems of the early modern period <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. The notion of the American archive today embodies and encodes that part of the American psyche that seeks to connect with history and culture, to strengthen community and a sense of belonging, and to protect people’s rights and entitlements.</p>
<p>The infrastructure of the archive can be understood in terms of its various modes of existence - intellectual, physical, and informational. In pursuit of professional legitimacy, the intellectual infrastructure of the archive has been developed as part of a push for autonomy from the discipline of history; a concern to have a distinct knowledge base of archival theory and practice. The goal of professionalism is manifested in archivists’ concern for standardization and the creation of consistency in norms, rules, values, work process, and product. As a physical infrastructure, the archival edifice and its work, storage, and research spaces are cocooned within building and environmental standards for materials security and management, disaster preparedness, and facilities expansion and renovation <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Its digital infrastructure enveloped within audit and certification standards for ensuring the trustworthiness of the repository in terms of its organizational structure, digital object management, and security risk management. As an intellectual base for research today, archives are the centralized and distributed conduits to analog and digital documentary by-products of past human activity – personal, organizational, and governmental. While the data archive is the primary home for surveys, enumerations, public opinion polls, and the like, the archive is the storehouse of information and evidence about social life and social institutions that elements of society deem valuable to preserve. Operated by archivists, the archive is the place to go to  “gather firsthand facts, data, and evidence”  from analog and digital primary sources that run the gamut from letters, reports, notes, memos, and photographs to email, database files and twitter feeds.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>
<p>As a form of knowledge infrastructure, archives in the United States were funded initially through private enterprise vis-à-vis membership supporting historical societies. The largesse of public monies was later infused in state, federal, and city run archives through means of government appropriations, with the higher education sector supporting archives with public money funded through state taxes. In the process, archives were entangled with powerful political, economic, and social forces with constraining and enabling effects on their utility and function. The chief technical function of the archive is to move recorded information across time and over distance for current and future generations. Grounded in time and place, materials are held and made accessible within the archive so that people can come to an understanding of the past. In the process, as Tom Nesmith says,  “users of archives invariably want to look straight through archival institutions, their work, and their records, at something else in the past of greater importance and interest to them”   <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>. Yet overlooking the archive obscures the fact that access to the past and its traces is both limited and incomplete; populated from and embedded within societal frames that serve to control, amplify, and reproduce elements and ideologies of society.</p>
<p>In the United States historians were the initial system builders. Transferring and adapting European practices they advocated for the construction of the infrastructure of the archive, culminating in its modern form in the early twentieth century. In the nineteenth century, historical research was constituted around a set of inculcated collective practices; a distinct scientific method that sought to cement and legitimize the work and its place within the academy. In this imagining, the historian sought to usher in the notion of the archive as  <em>the</em>  source for data for a new scientific approach to history; mastering the archive by amassing facts and evidence from whence he (and it usually was a ‘he’)  “impartially and rationally constructed a scientific account of past reality”   <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. Yet by the 1930s the still nascent American historical profession had sloughed off its responsibility for managing the archive, with the occupation of the archivist emerging as the labor to configure the techniques and technologies necessary to support, develop, and sustain this information work <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Throughout, history demonstrates that archival work is service work; work in maintaining the information infrastructure for others, whether it be for bureaucracies, administrations, or researchers and their orderly pursuit of knowledge. In this latter scenario, the archivists serve as the defacto ‘information intermediary,’ helping researchers as they  “approach, consider, and make sense of information”   <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. Yet, as noted previously, the work that the archivist performs on the historical record moves the profession beyond intermediary to that of mediator. As Latour notes, mediators are transformative – working to  “transform, translate, distort, and modify the meaning or the elements they are supposed to carry”   <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. Analogies and metaphors in the archival literature are rife with references to these distinctive understandings of archival infrastructure and archival work. These understandings align with Star’s concept of the master narrative, an encoding or work which involves the reduction of the infrastructural actor to the  “unconscious center, the pseudo-inclusive generic”   <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="the-alignment-of-the-archive-to-maintenance-work">The Alignment of the Archive to Maintenance Work</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Maintenance is a war – maybe  <em>the</em>  war – with entropy<br>
<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup><br>
In the discourse of the digital humanities, an appreciation of the agentic role and orientation of the archive does not always resonate or align with the expectations and carefully crafted identities of stakeholders external to the archival profession. In the digital age, prevailing forces revolve around the need for humanities scholarship to be innovative, boundless, and future oriented. The archive with its perceived adamancy, physicality, and rootedness complicates that image leaving stakeholders to adjust archival representations to suit. One option in situating the role of the archive and the archivist in this new endeavor is to recast the archivist in a decidedly backstage role and one directed by the wisdom and experience of those served. As Drucker describes, information professionals do well to remember that their role in infrastructural development is that of builder or architect, always working at the behest of the client - the humanities scholar. For Drucker, the way that the humanities scholar understands knowledge and their tasks as scholars should be the primary drivers as scholarly environments are designed <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of what role humanities scholars ascribe to it, the archival profession has always had a strong sense of its own autonomy; an autonomy that is constructed and reconstructed as it comes into contact and under the influence of various disciplines – history, library and information science, and more recently, computer science. Yet the archival profession has waxed and waned in its understanding of the power inherent in its structures and in its labor, and the degree to which it is comfortable revealing or hiding this capacity from others. Early metaphors of labor, servitude, and care abound as applied to the profession of the archivist. Given that writing was first developed in the process of  “keeping account of the land and its produce”   <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> it seems fitting that a predominant image is that of agrarian toil in service of others with the archivist preparing the way for the scholarly process to come.</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth century, Canadian archivist, Douglas Brymner equated the archivist to a settler working to clear the land in readiness for cultivation by the historian: the archivist  “must not forget that he is only the pioneer whose duty is to clear away obstructions; the cultivated ﬁelds will follow”   <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. Later, Hugh Taylor characterized archival work as more in tune with well-rounded husbandry; with records and the information they contained needing to be cultivated and tended by archivists  “if there is to be a fertile crop of knowledge and wisdom forthcoming”   <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>. Pioneering English archivist Hilary Jenkinson compared the archivist to a beast of burden; an ox in servitude of man, entitled occasionally to partake in the spoils of his own manual labor <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  Distinct from the agricultural frame, the analogy of the archivist to that of a paleontologist surfaced in the Dutch manual of Muller, Feith, and Fruin; an early attempt to wrap archival labor in a mantle of professionalism and scientific legitimacy <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. This mantle reemerged in the digital age with the idea of the archivist as digital archaeologist, unearthing, excavating, and preserving important digital objects inscribed on obsolete storage media <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most enduring modern archival metaphor is that of the archivist as physical and intellectual custodian or guardian, whether it be of the material under care or of a creator’s or donor’s legacy <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. Indeed, Terry Cook has equated the archival profession to that of  “an invisible caretaker, a docile handmaiden”   <sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>. Yet, from a postmodern perspective, the archivist, and their workplace, are understood as more consequential than such a supporting role implies. Brien Brothman’s <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> notion of the archivist as custodian or groundskeeper is one in which the archival ‘ordering’ and ‘tidying up’ of physical and intellectual spaces is creative and consequential. Mediative so to speak. Indeed, the archival designation and removal of information that is deemed ‘dirt,’ ‘rubbish,’ ‘weeds,’ or ‘debris’ is seen as a form of axiological othering; what Brothman deems  “socially determined exclusion”   <sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. Thus, the archival essence is to theorize about and to engage in acts of qualification and disqualification. The resultant selective knowledge transfer is accompanied by the equally far-reaching effect of archival ordering and representation via the processes of arrangement and description; acknowledging that the archivist is not only selectively moving information through time and space but co-creating and situating it in the process <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. The idea of the archivist as ‘someone who protects’ has also been lately realigned; this time with carceral and other metaphors of imprisonment. This reimagined metaphor confesses the archival role in controlling and consigning the record and in surveilling, monitoring, and policing the researcher who enters onto the archival premises <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. It is an acknowledgment that the archive, like other infrastructural forms, can  “bend human routines and material practices to its will”   <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Drawing from the work of feminist theorist Judith Butler, recent archival scholarships also home in on the metaphor of performativity. In such a scenario archival work is described as ritualized labor within a performative space with archivists acting as  “performers in the drama of memory-making”   <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. Linking archival work to that of performativity is an acknowledgement and a call to consciousness that standard archival procedures exist as inherited scripts; ones the profession is capable of embodying but also rewriting or otherwise setting aside. Here Terry Cook and Joan Schwartz foreground the archivist as  “an actor, not a guardian; a performer, not a custodian”   <sup id="fnref1:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. In doing so the work of the archivist is deliberatively moved from a backstage to a front stage perspective. A similar metaphor is introduced by Gabrielle Dean <sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> who rejects the notion that the archival encounter is solely that between researcher and source. Instead, she heralds the archivist as part of a cast of characters, conjuring these relationships within the archive as  “more a barn dance than a pas de deux.”</p>
<p>In the newest twist on agentive understanding, the most militant archival metaphor is ecological in origin, serving as a potential corrective to the various anthropocentric takes on archiving that have been discussed to date. Reorienting the archival perspective, Dani Stuchel <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> leads from the premise that  “not all agents or entities responsible for material changes in the archive are human,”  and thus the archive should be understood as more than a  “human institution about human history.”  Directing the archival profession to theories from the fields of new materialism and critical plant studies Stuchel reveals the often hidden but vibrant life force and material reality of things in the archive; formed in a complex web of people, societies, cultures, technologies, and the natural world with aims that can be independent of our own <sup id="fnref1:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. This is a worldview in which archives are understood as  “agential material assemblages characterized as much by the actions of dust, moisture, and plant matter as they are by human records and labor”   <sup id="fnref2:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Returning to the central notion of this article - that of aligning the role of the archivist to infrastructure and the installation and repair of systems - we can see that this idea was first explored by Canadian archivist Hugh Taylor in the 1980s in his use of the metaphor of the archivist as plumber <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. Taylor compares the inner workings of the archive to a network of pipes; conduits through which information flows along distinct channels, with descriptive finding aids acting like taps to deliver information to the user. In this metaphor, archivists’ bedrock concern is maintenance:  “that our storage tanks do not leak, our taps work, and the information comes out in a nice steady stream”   <sup id="fnref1:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>. Playing into the image that later evoked concern from digital humanists, Taylor characterizes such long-established archival information systems as staid, inward looking, and rather monopolistic in outlook. Yet, tying the archivist to an image such as the plumber is critical to rendering the archive as a material entity (human and non-human); showing it to exist as a socio-technical (as well as ecological) space through which information flows from creating entities through the archivist to the humanities scholar, while surfacing the ‘on the job’ labor that makes the process possible.</p>
<p>Whatever the ascribed metaphor, the notion that archivists merely work (whether efficiently or not) at the behest of the client plays into the notion of humanities scholarship as an individualistic and self-contained endeavor. It is a viewpoint that undermines or at best downplays the cooperative if sometimes fluctuating efforts involved in the practice of humanities scholarship, including the many dependencies and interdependencies between the creator, the scholar, and the archivist. It seems expedient to reiterate here that the work that goes into imagining an infrastructure into being should be accompanied by the work that goes into maintaining it long term and ensuring its future. Indeed, the combination of infrastructure and the scope of human and of historical time should invariably and inevitably lead to questions of upkeep. Upkeep is a state of being, an act, a process, a form of care taking or aftercare, and sometimes a means to an end. In the research literature ‘upkeep’ is synonymous with the concept of ‘maintenance.’ In academic disciplines and professional practice, maintenance is a lens ( “a theoretical framework, an ethos, a methodology, and a political cause” ) that grounds our experience of a world in which the breakdown and repair of infrastructures (political, civic, physical, social, natural etc.) are commonplace <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As Edgerton notes, maintenance lives in a  “twilight world, hardly visible in the formal accounts societies make of themselves”   <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. In a blog post on the Maintainers website, the authors <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> ruminate on the reasons why maintenance and maintenance work are neglected at all levels of society; factors with a clear resonance with the discourse around the future of the humanities. According to Russell et al. <sup id="fnref1:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>, the psychological disposition of people today shows a preference for novel things in the environment, with such a cognitive bias coexisting with a desire for proximate rather than distant outcomes. Moving from the individual to the societal and cultural level they see an attunement to and mythologizing of innovation and short-term growth to the detriment of caring for the established and the operationalized. The authors note that economic incentives factor into whether organizations approach maintenance in a proactive or a reactive and repair-focused manner, with notions of profitability and performance often formative conditions. Here the idea of status, interest, and power are also prevailing forces, impacting which public and private infrastructures are deemed worthy of maintenance, with the identity markers of maintainers, including that of gender, positioning this occupational role low in the established social hierarchy. From the perspective of the maintainers themselves, temporal and social pressures mean that a delicate balance or set of tradeoffs are always in play when it comes to fixing things under their care. Fixes can be patchwork, hasty, and short lived or systemic, methodical, and long-term. In the first case the bet is on making something better quickly while setting aside the issue that it will continue to get worse in the long-term. In the second scenario the fundamentals of the situation are addressed over time, even as the situation may deteriorate in the short and medium term.</p>
<p>These reasons for the neglect of maintenance and maintenance work resonate in the archival profession today. Indeed, the difficulties of maintenance have long been seared into the archival imaginary <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>. Arguably, the story of the archive in the United States has been one of ongoing conditions and acts of maintenance and of repair conditioned by the framework of fragility. The changing nature of institutions, technologies, social arrangements, and stakeholders means that all infrastructures are fragile over time <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. Yet the archival notion of fragility is particularly tied to conditions that drive toward notions of failure and degradation, including the impossibilities of maintaining a material and intellectual infrastructure that the archival profession has closely tied to a bedrock principle of permanence. Time here is the constant that leads to breakdown. It is the recognition that the archival infrastructure is not and cannot be an adamantine structure. In such an open-ended scenario, durability is only possible when there is immediate and ongoing  “care and maintenance of individual components and the links between them”   <sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In a distinct yet related sense, the notion of infrastructural fragility is also bound to the societal level and to the constant uncertainty whether the financial resources necessary to sustain the archive will be forthcoming <sup id="fnref2:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Indeed, the archival infrastructure has long been subjected to political buffeting as society struggles to understand and accept the archive as  “an administrative, economic, or social good”   <sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. The ongoing battle for resources and the conditions of scarcity that result, are tied to the lack of social resonance to that which the archive clings - to the past, to history and the humanities, to the study of human culture. The feminized nature of the profession serves as an additional point of perceived fragility, providing little of the needed social and political cover or cachet to enhance the status of archival labor. The lived experience of scarcity is thus defined by and embedded within women’s maintenance work.</p>
<p>A vignette from the story of the emergence of the archival infrastructure in the United States demonstrates the fragility inherent in organizations with low social visibility as embedded in different societal layers. The case of the official repository of archival records for the U.S. state of Georgia serves as an exemplar here, highlighting the cyclical political and social forces of administrative and bureaucratic reform that continually undermine the survival of this and other state archival agencies over more than a century of existence <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref2:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. On the first day of January in 1919 the Georgia Department of Archives and History began its life in the state capitol building in downtown Atlanta operated by a staff of three - the first state archivist, Lucian Lamar Knight; a stenographer; and an African American porter, Charlie Justice. Speaking to the hearts and minds that glorified a history of the elites and of white southern exceptionalism, the archive yet struggled to endure in a state system in which value adhered overwhelmingly to those contributing to the narrative of capital rather than historical accumulation. Two years after operations commenced, Governor Thomas W. Hardwick (1921-1923) singled out the Department for closure under the aegis of a state retrenchment plan. With a focus on pruning state agencies of an educational, humanitarian, and charitable nature (categories which Hardwick believed fell outside of the purview of legitimate state business), Hardwick set in motion a plan of economy and efficiency that echo in the halls of state government a century later <sup id="fnref3:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While supporters of its historical mission rallied to defeat the first onslaught on the infrastructure of the Georgia state archive, its second and third decades are a textbook case of how macro and meso level economic prerogatives for maintenance abide with localized micro-level ones. Indeed, the story of the second state archivist of Georgia, Ruth Blair (1925-1937) highlights how the struggle to maintain infrastructure is often part of the gendered division of labor. As Denis and Pontille note,  “maintenance work participates in a care of things”   <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>. Blair’s story is one of infrastructural care work; work in which she gave her practical labor to ‘patch up,’ ‘set right’ and ‘keep going’ an infrastructure still in its infancy. This commitment to holding together the archive was put into practice when Blair secured the removal of the Archives Department from the cramped conditions at the State Capitol to Rhodes Hall, a Romanesque revival style twenty-two room mansion on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, formally known as ‘Le Rêve.’ While the legislature appropriated $5,000 to repair the building and install shelving, the economic conditions of depression-era Georgia provided cover for a situation in which the specificities of care could be neglected. Thus, no state money was appropriated for the ongoing maintenance of the building, an expenditure estimated at $1,500 annually (the cost split between employing a porter and paying for heat, light, water, and incidentals). With the state abrogating its duty as maintainer, Blair took on the responsibility to pay for the upkeep of the building, an undertaking that cost no less than $1,800 before the situation was resolved <sup id="fnref1:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In a classic case of the fact that, as Berlant says,  “resilience and repair don’t necessarily neutralize the problem that generated the need for them”   <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>, the Georgia Archives continues under a perpetual shadow of scarcity a century after its founding. In the latest incarnation in 2012, Georgia Governor John Nathan Deal and Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp waged their own campaign to shutter this administrative unit of state government. This even though expenditures on state archives and records programs were later established as below one-tenth of 1 percent of total state expenditures <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>. In this instance the fragility of the archive was once again bound to rhetoric in the United States that champions government frugality and retrenchment, aimed solely at a program and services deemed superfluous to the core functions of government <sup id="fnref4:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. And once again it was only in the mobilization and deployment of concerted countermining weights - in this instance the longevity of the archives installed base and the ability to marshal historical, heritage, and genealogical organizations to its cause – that crisis was diverted.</p>
<h2 id="the-archive-and-the-labor-of-information-maintenance-and-repair">The Archive and the Labor of Information Maintenance and Repair</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The upshot is that millions of people go to work each day to do things that almost no one but themselves understands but which large numbers of people believe they know enough to set policy, offer advice, or redesign. Work has become invisible</em> .<br>
<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup><br>
Still, it is not just the physical or hard infrastructure of the archive that must be maintained for the research process to function. Like Barley and Bechky’s study of technicians in scientific labs, archivists, as technicians for the humanities,  “manage the interface between a larger work process and the materials on which the process depends”   <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>. In the language of goods and services, the archive exists as an infrastructure of information production, distribution, and consumption. Embedded in the notion of the archive is the idea of a steady flow of information that resides within and moves through socio-technical systems - from the creator to the archivist to the researcher. Maintaining this information flow subtends and is given expression in the archive through the backstage and normalized act of archival processing. Archival processing is connective and coordinative work; the ‘articulation work’ <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>, so to speak, that the archivist does as a middle actor to link and mediate between past, present, and future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase ‘archival processing’ is a stand in for the work that allows the archivist to gain intellectual and physical control of archival materials through the activities of accessioning, arrangement, description, and preservation. This work includes arranging or rearranging archival materials into recognized groupings (the evidentiary layers of record group, subgroups, series, and files), while also stabilizing and inscribing context in a descriptive finding aid for the collection ready for the user to discover. The rhetorical strategy of the finding aid works to hide the agency and emotion of the archivist from the process and from the associated narrative presented to the reader <sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. In this way, archival processing demonstrates how the act of mediation can be embodied but at the same time rendered invisible through tools <sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Archival processing exists within a system that is broadly characterized by its modularity; modularity being an ‘ordering concept’ used by information disciplines and professions as a strategy to manage information under their control <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. In the archival system, processing of materials takes on the characteristics of a core module, being standardized across collections and interchangeable among them. Processing also demonstrates modularity in its ability to coordinate and manage complexity; to black-box the messy internal details of the system and thus bring  “efficiency and order” to a complex socio-technical system”   <sup id="fnref1:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. Processing is also a sign that data does not automatically flow along the archival pipeline; it requires what Leonelli describes as careful and standardized packaging to be transported from the context of production across the research infrastructure with the ability to serve as potential evidence at the end of its journey <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The conditions for processing are closely tied to notions of evidence. According to Downey, information labor exists to make information useful, in the process working to set information in motion so it can circulate from one context to another <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. In the archive, the collection level maintenance work of the archivist exists in what Barley and Bechky <sup id="fnref1:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup> call an act of ‘brokerage’ - a four-way relationship of creator, archivist (as technician), user, and the record. Mediation is necessary because the traditional impulses of historical methodology, buried within colonialist and capitalist frames, are inherently extractive. For archivists, analog and digital records exist as technical artifacts to be curated when removed from their creating context. Archivists respond to the act of extraction by engaging in ongoing restorative labor – backstage work to recreate the context of creation for subsequent users of the archive <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>. If the goal of social science data curators is that the artifacts be pristine to be reused <sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, the goal of the processing archivist is to resettle the artifacts as evidence in place, but to do so within the confines and limitations of the archive <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An elemental concern for setting information in context means that archivists strive to maintain the link between the records, their creators, the functions and activities that brought the records into being, and the recordkeeping structures in which they were originally stored. This maintenance work is methodologized through guiding principles and conventions of practice; these are the base layers of infrastructure as noted by Bowker and Star <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>. In the analog realm these conventions of practice center on cognitive and physical skills which archivists deploy to review, analyze, sort, organize, and present information in context. In the digital realm of small and big data collections, these same skills are utilized in tandem with forensics and computational methods - including machine learning, natural language processing, and data mining - to inform, enrich, and augment digital preprocessing and processing tasks attuned to notions of contextualization <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Birthed in ideas from the profession’s European antecedents, American archivists draw from two fundamental principles under the banner of ‘provenance’ to steer archival work, and the performance of such, away from hazards that could decontextualize the information under its control. The principle of  <em>respect des fonds</em>  dictates that  “records of different origins (provenance) be kept separate to preserve their context”   <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>. The principle of original order dictates that  “the organization and sequence of records established by the creator of the records”  must be maintained <sup id="fnref1:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>. While once static and tightly circumscribed, the impact of ongoing technological, societal, and disciplinary development has extended archivists’ understanding of these concepts over the past sixty years. The result is an expansive set of entity relationships to be explored and described tying analog and digital records not only to bureaucratic and administrative structures, but to networks of surrounding and contextualizing forces and behaviors including the social and technical practices in which records participate; the communities, cultures, and subjects that co-create and locate the records; and the archivists, readers, and other users who animate the record bringing it once again to life <sup id="fnref1:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In the analog and the digital world there is a distinct physicality to all aspects of processing, although this work is obscured or rendered invisible from public view, happening as it does in the private staff areas of the archive. In this private space, processing acts as what is called a ‘concealed tool,’ part of a long-established tradition of maintenance and repair <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>. In terms of preservation, repair is a bench activity for analog materials and a technical and forensics process for objects born within digital space; the site of repair taking place at the processing workbench and the digital archive workstation, respectively. In the work of repair, as Stuchel notes, the emphasis is on human purposes, a stance that neglects the reality that objects  “change in ways proper to their materiality without regard for our desire to remember and prove”   <sup id="fnref3:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. Indeed, Stuchel’s <sup id="fnref4:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> work highlights the tendency for archival things to be viewed as resources to be fixed and mined, rather than as part of vibrant and diffuse other-than-human components that engage and influence the world. It is the difference between a values-based approach that seeks to preserve the past by mitigating depletion and loss and a living heritage approach that sees change as a fundamental aspect of continuity <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>. In effect, the idea of decay exists as dueling notions - as a natural state of being in the world and as an imperative that archivists strive to subsume through maintenance and repair strategies.</p>
<p>In the bench work that has traditionally encompassed repair, archivists engage in micro-processes, physically inspecting the records and carrying out technical preservation and conservation treatments to minimize deterioration of materials (and the information they carry) and maximize their projected life span. Co-opting the words of Dant, this benchwork shows that  “the work of repair takes ingenuity in identifying the problem and then a wide range of skills and tools to make the object useable again; it involves a mixture of perceptual, cognitive and manual skills that are normally associated with handcraft”   <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>. The notion of repair is so ubiquitous in the digital realm that systems are designed to supplement the work of the archivist in the form of automatic self-repair  <sup id="fnref1:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup> indicating when digital files are corrupted, in need of restoration or replacement. The job of maintenance – of  “arresting a cultural object in time, maintaining it as closely as possible in the state in which it was created”   <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup> - is especially critical for digital objects given their volume, complexity, and fragility. Indeed, as Trace <sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> and Galloway <sup id="fnref1:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup> note, the work of maintaining digital objects requires the archivist to get below the digital interface to the mechanism, documenting and preserving the hardware and software contexts that shape digital objects and give them life.</p>
<p>If,  “in order to operate over long periods of time, old infrastructural designs must be constantly retrofitted to meet new contingencies”   <sup id="fnref1:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>, the ascendency of born-digital materials shows how the archival infrastructure alters and improvises as archival labor flexes its creativity in response to technological provocations. Deciding which version of a software environment to document is a particularly complex problem given that elements of the originating software and hardware stack likely evolved at different rates over the life of the digital object <sup id="fnref2:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>. As Galloway <sup id="fnref3:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup> indicates, the practice of maintenance under these conditions requires craft work attuned to preserving both the digital output and the human input into legacy systems. In the first sense this entails homing in on the set of rules or standards that best represents the originary (or temporally situated) software environment and installing it on legacy systems for testing. In the second sense this craft work entails untangling interpellations, including  “the shaping of the user by the machine” ; the complex conversation in which actions can be read  “not just from the machines themselves but from those who made them and those who use them”   <sup id="fnref4:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>. At a broader level, archivists have also responded to the digital transition by retuning descriptive practices to model the multifaceted contexts in which digital information resides; contexts that are increasingly understood as dynamic and unbounded, best architected in networked form. Such ongoing adjustments to archival processing are evident, for example, in the newly released  _Records in Context _ conceptual model and ontology; work that comes out of the Expert Group on Archival Description (EGAD) established by the International Council on Archives (ICA).</p>
<p>In all this work archivists not only seek to fix the material object but the negotiated order around it. The notion of an attempted material and social repair is ever present here. Archivists understand that the creators’ original recordkeeping structures atrophy when removed from their original context, and materials themselves succumb to the elements and degrade over time. In their mind, archival maintenance occupies and constitutes what Jackson calls  “an  <em>aftermath</em> ”   <sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. The repair in this instance is an attempt to heal the rift in space and time that has opened between the materials as created and the materials as archived and used. It is an attempt to connect the materials to a creator, an activity, a place in time, and to a condition where they have the most meaning, allowing them to be brought to life again by those who frequent the archive. Throughout this physical and intellectual process, material traces of the repair explicitly and implicitly recede from view, an instantiation of the professional role ceded to and negotiated by the technical workers in the archive as it exists in a delicate balance between discretion and legitimation. While the agentic work of the archivist is pellucid in the processing manuals and descriptive standards documentation that accompany the work, the professional containment of such skills and knowledge means that it often goes unnoticed and unacknowledged by the scholarly communities that archivists exist to serve.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In 2020, AI researcher Timnit Gebru and computational social scientist Eun Seo Jo called for the creation of a new specialization within machine learning to focus on the ethical collection and annotation of socio-cultural data for AI research and systems. In this scenario, archives are given recognition as  “the longest standing communal effort to gather human information”  with the language and curatorial procedures honed by the archival profession said to demonstrate the sophistication necessary to serve as the framework for this initiative <sup id="fnref:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup>. Yet, the same respect for the archive as infrastructure and for the intellectual and physical labor of the archivist attuned to infrastructural maintenance and repair has been largely absent from scholars in the humanities.</p>
<p>In talking about humanities infrastructure, Anderson reminds us that  “if research infrastructures are to contribute to the transformation of research then it is important that researchers working on histories, literature, culture and other aspects of what makes us human understand the value of these infrastructures for their own practices and how they operate to facilitate and to enhance the production of their research”   <sup id="fnref:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup>. This article has set out to review the key reasons why historians and other humanities scholars should continue to pay attention to the infrastructural and maintenance work of the archive as it supports and extends humanities research into and through the digital era. Co-opting Downey’s insights into the nature of cultural heritage work, we can say that the importance of the archive and of archival information labor lies in its ability to allow analog and digital information to continually circulate and have value in society. It does this by providing information –  “cast as data, content, or knowledge”  — with a way to jump contexts across time, space, and disciplines, transposing information from the past into the future, from one kind of institution or intellectual domain to another, and from one kind of cultural and social milieu to another <sup id="fnref2:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. It is an acknowledgement that the humanities have meaning broader than innovation, with an emphasis on articulating how the archive sustains the notion of the humanities-in-use.</p>
<p>In a 2018 article, Russell and Vinsel <sup id="fnref1:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> asked us to consider: Where is maintenance work performed? What is being maintained? How is maintenance work organized? Who are the maintainers? Who pays for maintenance? Who benefits and who does not? This article has drawn attention to the nature of archival life as it helps to create and exist in and alongside the infrastructure of the humanities. It is a reminder that archivists are the workers that seek to maintain and repair an infrastructure in service of others. It is a reminder that it is archival labor that enables key processes required of humanities scholarship, including authentication, contextualization, and preservation of primary source material whether analog or digital in nature. It is a reminder that in the resource-constrained discipline that is the humanities the resilience of its research infrastructure is performed by the archival community despite the often fraught and precarious nature of maintenance and repair work.</p>
<p>To look into the future is to conceive of what could be and what can be brought to pass. The archive and the archivist have always taken the long view, imagining a future in which the archival record, no matter its underlying technology and lineage, is secure in its context, permanently available for whatever use a person can conjure. Humanities scholars are long overdue in joining the archival profession in this imagining. It is time to think about what the future of the humanities could look like if the archive is recentered as the enduring mechanism that drives humanities work and scholarship and whose longevity, endurance, and transformation archival labor has long sought to guarantee.</p>

<p>During the 1940s, Ángela Ruiz Robles, a teacher from León, Galicia, had a prescient vision of publishing’s future: Her  <em>Enciclopedia Mecánica</em>  would increase children’s access to affordable interactive educational materials. Her 1962 sketch (Figure 1) featured a device with three slots for lessons presented in scrolls. Students would insert the scrolls, browse the content and then answer questions on each lesson through rotating disks immediately below each scroll. Just as with a combination padlock, correct answers would result in positive haptic feedback. The Spanish Patent and Trademark Office granted Ruiz Robles two patents <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> for the device. El Ferrol Artillery Depot built a prototype based on the 1962 patent and in 1971, the Technical Institute of Applied Mechanical Experts explored the cost of manufacturing 10,000 units at 50-75 pesetas (around $1 in 1971) per unit but the initial start-up cost of 100,000 pesetas ($1,410) was prohibitive <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Both Ruiz Robles and her invention languished in relative obscurity until around 2007, when the importance of her work was recontextualized by the launch of the Kindle and an exhibition of her work at Museo Pedagóxico de Galicia in 2008 <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  Following this rediscovery, Ruiz Robles was honored by the Spanish Patent Office <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, a Google Doodle <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, a festschrift <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, a Madrid street name <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, and El Museo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología’s acquisition of her archives <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The retroactive recognition of Ruiz Robles’ inventions reveals a 60-year gestation period for the e-reader to shift from a patentable idea to mass-produced commodity. Patent filings speculating about the future of reading on-screen accelerated following the establishment of the terminal-mainframe computational paradigm in the 1960s but, as with the case of Ruiz Robles, inventors were conceptualizing digital publishing before the emergence of the personal computer. Patents map amateur and professional ambitions for the book’s future alongside the development of the digital computer. Previous histories of digital publishing often overlook this evidence base, creating a distorted narrative focusing on what appear to be a few outlier early devices rather than a concerted effort by several companies to create a functionable e-reader. As a corrective, in this article I offer a media archaeological analysis of digital publishing patents to develop the  <em>ebook imagination</em> , or the desires of readers and inventors for the future of reading on screen.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>  I demonstrate that while patent filings confirm the theoretical existence of e-readers long before the technology was commercially viable, unfortunately this early work often fixated on replicating the book as an object, overlooking vital issues in recreating the reading experience such as developing high quality screens. These innovations can only be traced through efforts led by other industries, demonstrating the ebook’s success relied on a convergence of adjacent technologies rather than an inevitability of early prototypes.</p>
<p>Erkki Huhtamo introduced media archaeology  “as a way of studying recurring cyclical phenomena that (re)appear and disappear and reappear over and over again in media history, somehow seeming to transcend specific historical contexts”   <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Media archaeology as a methodology celebrates historical cul-de-sacs and counterfactuals as a way of challenging conventional chronological narratives of progress. It is therefore an ideal approach to the historical analysis of digital publishing, where important evidence exists outside of these linear narratives. Individual patents may appear fanciful in retrospect, but collectively they reveal a sustained effort to map linear reading onto contemporary time-based media technologies. Through treating media history as cyclical, Eric Kluitenberg positions media archaeology  “primarily as a critique of progress”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, a rebuke to patent scholarship’s dominant emphasis on evolutionary models of technological development. While previous case studies of patents as evidence for technological developments reveal hierarchal networks of inventors <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, a media archaeology-informed approach instead emphasizes discontinuities within patents. Each generation reconceptualized the ebook based upon their own technological horizons shaped by their understanding of screen technologies.</p>
<p>The ebook imagination was shaped by long-running, contradictory desires to accurately replicate the printed book in digital form while improving upon its perceived limitations. The Kindle and competing platforms focused on mundane remediations of print. While this was more successful than experimental forms of digital publication, there has been a growing resentment towards the perceived stasis of ebooks such as the former CEO of Hachette, Arnaud Nourry’s dismissal of  “the ebook [as] a stupid product [because] there is no creativity, no enhancement, no real digital experience”   <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Nonetheless, the simplicity of ebooks for consumers belies the complex infrastructure underpinning a seamless user experience. I have previously termed this ‘ebookness,’ or the development of the ebook as a suite of interconnected services rather than a straightforward product <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. This service-oriented approach to ebook platforms emerged in a pragmatic response to the challenges of encouraging readers to buy e-readers. Conversely, the hypothetical design documents that embody the ebook imagination documents what ebooks  <em>could be</em> . Ebookness responded to the specific demands of the market (cheap content, always-on connectivity, social reading), while the ebook imagination presented an opportunity to reimagine reading on-screen. As I demonstrate in this article, designers struggled to move out of the codex paradigm in conceptualizing these new devices and disappointment around the Kindle paradigm has inspired designers to continue to consider the future of the ebook. My case study of early ebook patents reveals the tensions between a speculative vision of the future that is tied to nostalgia for print. Inventors were unable to push beyond this dichotomy to create a feasible technology that replicated the affordances of paper with comparable screen technology.</p>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>This article traces the development of the conceptual ebook drawing upon visual and textual evidence from granted patent applications to show how it was bound by the screen technology conventions of its day. I searched for patents with the words ‘electronic book’ in the title or abstract filed prior to 2000 in both the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and Espacenet patent databases. I cross referenced these search results with United States patents featuring classification number 345/901 or electronic book with display. The results included applications from countries including Japan, France, Germany, and the United States. I then followed citations in the ‘prior art’ of each of these applications to identify further relevant patents that did not appear in the initial search. While I noted all applications, my focus here is limited to Anglophone applications due to my language constraints although I consulted technical drawings from other languages. This returned a corpus of 98 applications ranging from 1893 to 2000 filed by both individual inventors and large media technology companies.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>The search and cross-reference facilities of the two patent databases significantly shape my dataset. For example, the formation of United States patent subclass 345/901 reveals the subjective nature of reconstructing a history of digital publishing through patent filings. It is a  “cross-reference art collection,”  or  “subject matter that is not specifically provided for in a particular subclass”  that emerges between classes <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. Cross-reference art collections reveal the instability of patent classifications, which are constantly updated to account for new research fields <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Older patents are often re-classified, as in the case of 345/901, where the earliest patent in the class is from 1979, but the parent class, ‘345’ was only introduced in 1993 <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>. Discrepancies between national digitization programs further re-enforce the perceived dominance of Anglo-European inventors. For example, the Indian patent database, InPASS, features only 23 total patents granted prior to 1990 despite a richer history of intellectual property protection dating back to the Patents and Designs Act of 1911. Conversely, the USPTO has a digital copy of all extant patents starting with Samuel Hopkin’s 1790 patent for manufacturing potash. <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  Despite offering access to facsimiles for all granted patents, full-text search on the USPTO website is only available for those published since 1976. Patents filed prior to 1976 must be discovered through citations or limited metadata, which excludes the inventor’s name and patent title. These geographical and historical weaknesses ensure a comprehensive history of ebook patents is beyond reach.</p>
<h2 id="patents-as-evidence">Patents as Evidence</h2>
<p>Beyond tracing the desires of ebook inventors before 2000, this article offers a blueprint for using patents in contemporary publishing research. Scholars have developed sophisticated overviews of the sociological structures of the twenty-first-century book trade <sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>, but less is known about the technical infrastructure underpinning contemporary publishing. We know more about hand presses and distribution networks of the fifteenth century than Amazon’s warehouse network or the digital asset management system of large publishers <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>. These blind spots emerge from the secrecy of large technology companies responsible for the creation, distribution, and reception of books and their digital equivalents. Public disclosures via patents reveals what Amazon, Apple and others intend to develop for the publishing industry. The USPTO archive also includes a range of patents filed by publishers including Elsevier and printing technology companies such as Konica Minolta <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Analysis of publishing adjacent filings can reveal the corporate research and development driving contemporary publishing otherwise closed off from scholars and complement other forms of archival and oral history research into digital publishing <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>. This does come with a major limitation, however, as patent filings do not necessarily indicate the direction of travel for a company as many corporations choose to apply for defensive patents just in case a technology later becomes viable.</p>
<p>The modern international patent emerged in the 1970s after the ratification of the Patent Cooperation Treaty in 1978 and the shift to electronic support mechanisms to relieve the increasing burden of processing patents <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>. By 2000, the USPTO offered public access to patents published since 1790 via its website. The resulting HTML version of a patent is rigidly structured to enable efficient searching and browsing of documents for relevant information including inventors, classifications, and claims. Researchers have explored the potential for quantitative analysis of the rich data contained in patent databases <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. For example, Manuel Trajtenberg proposed assessing the flow of knowledge as indicated by citations  “as first-hand evidence of the path-breaking nature of the original patent”   <sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>. There are caveats to this approach. Patents granted before 1976 are only available as facsimiles with no metadata, requiring manual consultation of citations. Where citations are easily traversable, they might not be the result of influence: examiners can introduce citations in the equivalent of a peer reviewer suggesting additional sources. Citation networks are therefore of limited value compared to richer visualization techniques such as mapping co-inventors or affiliations <sup id="fnref2:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Tim Lenoir and Eric Giannella argue that there is still value in analyzing citation networks with caution as  “the ‘noise’ can offer an opportunity for using patents as a vehicle for studying the coevolution of social and technical phenomena embodied in technological platforms”   <sup id="fnref2:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. My initial search of citation networks within the corpus suggested the geographical and technological discontinuities were too strong for such analysis to meaningfully trace a linear development of ebooks. Since there is no direct chain of influence, an archaeological approach examining the fractures and discontinuities is more useful.</p>
<p>Mario Biagiolo argues that the patent’s power emerges from its form:  “the idea of the invention did not emerge through a process of abstraction but through one of inscription — not by thinking it up but by writing it down”   <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. Inventors were free to imagine a technology if it was accompanied with a sufficiently convincing narrative for how it could be implemented, facilitating speculative applications. Viewing patents as discourse separate from socio-economic constraints encourages analysis through a media-archaeological framework. Erkki Huhtamo developed the concept of  “unrealized ‘dream machines,’ or discursive inventions (inventions that exist only as discourses)” that “can be just as revealing as realized artifacts”   <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. The shift from depositing physical prototypes to textualization enabled experimentation, but the system still favored physical objects. Despite the rigid linguistic conventions of the patent, the move to textualization encouraged more radical theoretical designs. At the same time, Hans Radder notes  “Patentable inventions need to be material. [&hellip;] An important implication is that conceptual or theoretical inventions cannot be patented”   <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>. The current patent system was established by the arrival of the personal computer, offering limited protections for software. Algorithms and software fell into a grey area where it was unclear if they could be patented without a material form. G. Con Diaz documents the work-around: the computer was viewed as  “an embodiment of the program, and it received patent protection in lieu of the program itself”   <sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. The issue affected the trajectory of early digital publishing patents since any innovation in process or software was accompanied by an implementation in hardware. If software was the intended focus, inventors would create speculative hardware to fulfill the criteria.</p>
<p>The development of electronic book patents does not follow a strict linear path through citations but instead reflects a disjointed history of experiments and failure. Major technology companies including Apple, Hewlett Packard and Xerox worked on e-readers during the 1990s, but other than Apple’s doomed Newton hardware series, no commercially viable product came of this experimentation <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. The relative boom at the turn of the millennium was driven instead by either start-ups (Softbook and NuvoMedia) or companies with a longer history of digital reference publishing (Franklin Electronic Publishers). Amazon’s Lab126 hardware engineers led by Gregg Zehr exploited the fragmented history of ebook patents to claim substantial innovation in a series of four utility patents documenting the Kindle 1 filed in March 2006 <sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>. Zehr and his collaborators were keen to position the Kindle as an innovative mobile computer rather than limiting its appeal as an e-reader, leading to citations of mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and innovative display technology. The longer history of the ebook can only be found through a deeper search of the USPTO and Espacenet archives.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-ebook">The First Ebook?</h2>
<p>Identifying the first ebook is a tricky proposition, relying on an individual’s interpretation of the meaning of ‘electronic’ and ‘book,’ reflecting Michael R. William’s claim that  “there is no such thing as ‘first’ in any activity associated with human invention. If you add enough adjectives to a description you can always claim your own favorite”   <sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>. Rather than attempt to identify the first e-reader, my aim here is instead to demonstrate the longer history of the conceptual ebook and explore why earlier attempts were unsuccessful. Nonetheless, locating the terminology’s origins is useful. The term ‘electronic book’ dates back at least to the late 1970s and transformed from general nomenclature for reading on screen to linking specifically to e-readers and consumables designed for that hardware by the 2000s.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>  Following my previous definition of “ebookness,” I restrict my definition of the electronic book to the latter, where specialist portable hardware (commonly known as e-readers) determines access to text rather than more general models of text retrieval including desktop systems such as the Memex. In the 1978 premiere of  <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>  radio play series, Ford Prefect, companion to the protagonist Arthur Dent, introduces the eponymous book in the first episode of the radio play as  “a sort of electronic book. It’ll tell you everything you want to know. That’s its job”   <sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>.  <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide</em>  is encyclopedic and therefore easier to conceptualize digitally than fiction or narrative non-fiction. Reference guides remained the dominant form of ebook rather than for entertainment or leisure until the late 1990s. The first instance of ‘electronic books’ in print appears in Harvey Poppel’s speculative short story for  <em>Harvard Business Review</em>  set in the 1990s where  “by the mid-1980s most American families owned or lease some form of home electronic information center”  with a provision for ebooks <sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. While Poppel focuses on consumable goods rather than hardware, the article was concurrent with David Rubincam’s patent submission for an ‘electronic book,’ filed in 1977 <sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that three sources independently coined the term electronic book in the late 1970s since, as Paul Ceruzzi notes, by 1977, the personal computer had matured with  “a strong and healthy industry of publications, software companies, and support groups to bring the novice on board”   <sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>. During this time, the ebook imagination flourished while the technology remained commercially unviable. For example, in 1978 the Read Only Memory (ROM) storage for a single book cost around $300 per unit to manufacture. An experimental device produced by the US military, computer scientists from the University of Colorado, and Texas Instruments avoided these limitations by creating a separate ROM with an indexed dictionary containing  “between 2,000 and 4,000 words account[ing] for 90% of most texts”   <sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>. An algorithm generates a numbered list of words present in a book which are used in lieu of the word in text. The project team concluded that effective compression alone would not compensate for infrastructure that was too immature at time of the project report in 1989 to develop beyond the initial research <sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup>. Likewise, the lithium-ion battery was developed in the early 1990s but did not appear in e-readers until NuvoMedia co-founders Martin Ebenhard and Marc Tarpenning released the second-generation Rocket eBook in 1999 <sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Infrastructure and storage would remain insurmountable costs until the mid-2000s, so inventors instead filed speculative patents. Nonetheless, the broader reshaping of computing from terminals to home computers encouraged speculation about the benefits of the personal computer, tying together previous strands of innovation on reading mechanically and on-screen. The ebook imagination extends beyond the development of the technology, constantly existing at the intersection of the inventor’s contemporary understanding of mechanical reading and the book, which is evident in how inventors portray their theoretical devices through the figures in their patent applications.</p>
<h2 id="experiments-in-print-digital-hybridity">Experiments in Print-Digital Hybridity</h2>
<p>Early inventors conceptualized print and mechanical reading as a hybrid form that would improve upon its constituent parts. Rubincam’s landmark patent established the experimental nature of early ebook design, where tropes of print met contemporary digital form. E-readers promised to replicate the tangible materiality of the printed page rather than attempting to simulate the page itself. This focus emphasized the form of the book over its accessibility as a technology, leading to several technological cul-de-sacs. Figure 2 visualizes the appearance of bookish features – cover, spines, and verso-recto spreads – as well as use of keyboards in the corpus of 96 patents’ technical drawings. Only 39 patents include at least one of these features, since many patents extend back to the microfilm and projection era, and several of the more recent patents provide only flow charts and schematics. The Euler diagram shows the extent of inventors’ interest in the book as opposed to hardware tropes. The relative lack of patents including keyboards or other mechanical references to digital culture demonstrates an interest in privileging the form of the book. Where patents include bookish elements, this mostly relies on page metaphors rather than engaging with the bound nature of the book.</p>

<p>To illustrate how this shaped patent design, we can examine the differences between Michael Lebby, Thomas Blair, and Gary Witting’s patent for an electronic book for Motorola (Figure 3) and John Harkins and Stephen Morriss’s Personal Electronic Aid for Maintenance (PEAM) patent assigned to Texas Instruments (Figure 4). Lebby et al embraced metaphors of bookishness including page turn mechanisms and updatable title pages bound  “with a leather or leather-like material so as to simulate a leather bound book”   <sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. There are still external signs of computation, such as the ports on the spine which are never developed further in the patent specification. To protect their claims, Lebby’s team included representations of their device with multiple pages and a flattened bifolio display. The patent lacks detail of how the more complex version would work, with the authors noting  “turning of a last page of the plurality of display page triggers the subsequent pages to begin on the first page of the plurality of display pages”   <sup id="fnref2:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. The patent documents one of the most complete remediations of the book, but it lacks detail on implementation, especially given the immaturity of the technology required to create multiple responsive paper-like screens at the time. Conversely, the Texas Instruments patent,  “Apparatus for delivering procedural type instructions,”  mimics the document through replicating the attaché case, a consequence of the project’s origins within the US military. The prototype ignored the trappings of the codex to emphasize non-linear traversal of documents. The attaché case has connotations of collections of papers to be sorted but the actual device is more conventional in design.</p>

<p>While the ebook imagination explored the aesthetics of books, actual implementation trends towards generic mobile computing design tropes. My visual analysis of a range of e-readers launched between 1990 and 2013 shows ebook hardware became more homogenous in design to reflect a convergence towards the touch screen in the wake of the iPhone’s success in 2007 <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. This reflects a larger shift within the ebook imagination where the conceptual e-reader became less bookish over time as the design paradigm for portable computers, smartphones and tablets became more established. Nonetheless, despite the emphasis on these new forms of computers, the ebook imagination never managed to emerge fully before the mid-2000s as inventors prioritized the overall form of the device over the most important e-reader technology: its paper-like screen.</p>
<h2 id="overlooking-screens">Overlooking Screens</h2>
<p>Why did several companies invest in e-readers only to not release a commercial product? Partially, this was due to a lack of institutional memory and knowledge of competitors’ failed attempts. The genre of patents is partially responsible as inventors are expected to demonstrate novelty rather than track down predecessors and the focus on tangible objects encourages experiments with form rather than function. Nonetheless, part of the early ebook imagination’s failure rests on an inability to move beyond form when designing e-readers. Creating book-like e-readers allowed designers to experiment with form, but the direct presentation of reading material was a greater concern and challenge: How can digital technology replicate, or even improve upon, paper? Paper is a sophisticated, low-cost technology, while remaining easy-to-use and durable. At the turn of the twentieth century, microfilm offered one pathway towards a post-print reading machine.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup>  The work of modernist Bob Brown and his Readies is well recited within histories of digital publishing despite the presence of earlier microfilm-based reading machines <sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup> . The New York Stock Exchange’s ticker tapes, which constantly scrolled to offer updates on stock prices, inspired Brown to conceptualize a reading machine using microfilm. The medium appealed to Brown as he saw a parallel between developments in time-based media and speed reading. Brown opened his manifesto by acknowledging that  “The written word hasn’t kept up with the age. The movies have outmanoeuvered it. We have the talkies, but as yet no Readies”   <sup id="fnref1:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. His bold vision argued  “writing must become more optical, more eye-teasing, more eye-tasty, to give the word its due and tune-in on the age. Books are antiquated word containers.”  Brown proposed instead  “reading will need to be done by a machine; microscopic type of a movable tape running beneath a slot equipped with a magnifying glass”   <sup id="fnref2:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>. Brown considered a patent but never filed for one, preferring to leave his device as part of an adjacent literary ebook imagination, also featuring  <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>   <sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. If Brown had decided to file a patent for the Readies, his success was far from guaranteed. Developments with microphotography and microfilm led to a flurry of other patent filings during the early twentieth century, starting with Chenoweth and Rogers’ Memorandum Holder patent, which used scrolling microscopic print attached to a pair of glasses to allow users to view their notes at will <sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While the preceding inventions were never launched commercially, time-based media was the inspiration for several patents that were adapted for market <sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup>. Like Brown’s Readies, inventors such as L.J. Stoyanoff of Perceptual Development Lab, understood the power of microfilm for speed reading. The Lab launched an implementation of the technology described in his patent,  “A Device for Reading Training,”  in 1957, called the ‘PerceptoScope’ <sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>. The machine facilitated speedreading through  “a pair of films in overlapping relationship for unison projection, a text film and a fixation film”   <sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. While acknowledging that competing devices were available, Stoyanoff suggested the PerceptoScope was less expensive. Just like the Readies, the PerceptoScope relied on the user’s familiarity with time-based media and restricted reading to a strictly linear process. As a result, even at a lower cost, the device filled a niche in reading rather than offering the full affordances of the codex. Bootstrapping reading on-screen to time-based technologies was fleeting and largely disappeared once screen technologies were better equipped to maintain a static image.</p>
<p>Other inventors wanted to offer a more accurate remediation of the book. Microform viewers were often too bulky to be useful as portable book surrogates. Bradley Fiske, a US Navy officer and serial inventor of devices for military and civilian use, worked on a portable microphotograph reader throughout the 1920s and 30s <sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup>. Fiske envisioned readers using a series of retractable lenses to view text at a smaller scale with one hand while adjusting the position of the microprint with the other. His first patent <sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>, filed in 1920, describes a device  “intended principally as a substitute for books, magazines, pamphlets, newspapers, or any other vehicle by which printed words are read at the present time [….] to secure economy of paper.”  The emphasis on the economy of paper diverged from Bob Brown and Vannevar Bush’s privileging of speed-reading and non-linear traversals respectively to instead replicate the page in a reduced format: a core feature of successful e-readers. Fiske iterated on the design over the 1920s <sup id="fnref1:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup>, which worked to reduce both the complexity and size of his reading machine. He was renowned for his devices and Bob Brown corresponded with him when considering the development of the Readies for advice on the patent process <sup id="fnref1:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup>. Matts Lindström describes Fiske’s print reduction mechanisms as an early form of ‘micromedia,’ or  “various technologies of reproduction and representation on the smallest possible scale, beyond the very limits of human perception”   <sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>. Micromedia only re-emerged with commercial e-reader hardware, but on an even smaller scale than Fiske envisaged. The introduction of optical media such as the CD-ROM enabled inscription at the nano-level, only visible through a microscope and able to contain much more information than previous micromedia <sup id="fnref:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup>. The various experiments in portable microfilm readers never overcame the limitations of the medium, and it was only with the combination of nanomedia and more appropriate optical technology that the ebook could succeed. Microfilm, ticker tapes and other facsimile-oriented platforms demonstrated the possibility of a post-print codex mechanical book but it would require a paradigm shift in visual reproduction technology to fully explore these possibilities. Luckily, the rising popularity of the television during the first half of the twentieth century led to investment in various forms of display screen technologies that would provide an ideal platform for developing the ebook imagination.</p>

<p>During the twentieth century, three screen technologies dominated visions of reading on-screen: CRT (1858), LCD (Liquid Crystal Display, 1888) and LED (Light Emitting Diodes, 1907). Figure 6 shows a visual comparison of the three technologies alongside electronic paper, the screen technology used by most major contemporary e-readers. Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost state  “in a CRT, patterns of electrons are fired at glass that is coated on the inside with phosphors. These glow to create the visible picture. The screen image is not drawn all at once, but in individual scan lines”   <sup id="fnref:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup>. A color CRT screen displays colors through clustering red, green, and blue phosphors as shown in Figure 6. The technology was integral to the uptake of televisions and early computing but was limited for mobile consumption due to its bulky nature. The fast trace powering CRTs made reading on-screen for an extended period difficult as the screen could refresh up to 60 times per second to avoid so-called image burn-in. Inventors only specified CRT as the primary display medium when the patent application was based around the terrestrial television network through extending teletext <sup id="fnref:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup>. These sub-optimal conditions would be offset by the large audience who already had televisions at their disposal. The application of so-called liquid crystals such as cholesteryl benzoate that can exist in  “an intermediate state between a crystalline solid and a normal liquid”  to screens in the 1960s offered a solution to CRT’s limitations <sup id="fnref:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup>. LCD screens encapsulate liquid crystals that are manipulated by two polarized films to produce images. The liquid crystals do not emit light, which instead must be provided through a reflexive surface or light source behind the screen. LCD screens were more appropriate for electronic books as they were cheap and portable, with lower requirements for illumination. LED displays relied instead on arrays of individual lights. Alphanumeric LED displays most commonly appear as segmented matrices (as shown in Figure 6) where strips of LEDs combine to form text and numbers for electronic calculators and digital watches since the late 1960s <sup id="fnref:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>. This success encouraged Russell Andrews and colleagues from the Stewart-Warner Corporation to file a patent for an LED-based  “Traveling Message Display”  and William Brooks filed a similar patent for  “Variable Message Displays”   <sup id="fnref1:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup>. The technology had limited scope for longer-form reading as the pixel density was too low to scale to represent a whole page and its influence waned as other displays became cheaper.</p>
<p>Since the patent system encourages making broad claims, unless the display was part of the claims, inventors would avoid specifying exact screen configurations. For example, Theodor Heutschi’s  “Electronic Device, Preferably an Electronic Book,”  filed in 1999, states:  “The display preferably provided as an LCD-display”   <sup id="fnref:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup>. Even when aspects of the screen were central to the patent’s claims, the inventors remained vague with specifications. Lebby et al.’s patent for Motorola provides minimal detail on implementation:  “the plurality of displays is made by any suitable method or technology”   <sup id="fnref3:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>. It was not until the arrival of electronic paper that ebook inventors became interested in screen displays beyond such generalities.</p>
<p>Innovations in screen technology happened outwith patent filings connected to electronic books, as inventors were more interested in the device’s form. These core technologies were instead developed by third parties for adjacent uses. The misplaced emphasis of inventors, ignoring the screen, led to the stagnation of the ebook imagination in transition to commercial products. This experimentation, and early commercial failures, coalesced to demonstrate the importance of screen technologies for the future of the ebook. When the Kindle and Sony PRS-500 launched with electronic paper screens in the mid-2000s, the devices exploited technology developed entirely outside of the ebook imagination. Visions of full-color, high-definition, constantly-refreshing bendable screens have remained in the realm of science fiction and largely out of the patent literature. This inspiration can be seen in Phillips and E Ink’s collaboration to create what they termed  “Radio Paper”  in 2003. Radio paper would couple  “the development of organic and plastic transistors”  to create screens  “flexible enough to fold and roll up […] with wireless Internet access,”  by 2005 <sup id="fnref:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup>. The ambitious goal is still beyond commercially available technology a decade and a half later, but it remains an active goal with substantial research and development investment from the now-defunct Amazon subsidiary LiquaVista, who received 240 patents for technology featuring electrowetting before being shut down in 2018.</p>
<p>Electronic paper was superior to other technologies but took longer to become commercially viable. Early implementations of electrophoretic displays, the most common form of electronic paper, date back to the 1970s, when contemporaneous developments in Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre (PARC) arrived at the same conclusion <sup id="fnref:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup>. Electronic paper was designed for static visual display rather than time-based media such as CRT, which is sub-optimal for reading since a static image does not need to be refreshed, requiring a constant light and power source. A ‘bistable display’ electronic paper screen instead maintains a consistent image indefinitely without drawing further battery power. Electronic paper was developed simultaneously by the two companies for different ends. Matsushita saw the potential for advertising where screens need to be adjusted sporadically but otherwise remain stable for long passages of time. Conversely, Sheridan led the development of Xerox PARC’s Gyricon technology as the display for its eponymous computer prototype. The technology remained dormant until the mid-1990s when Xerox PARC restarted its ‘electric paper’ through a subsidiary, Gryricon LLC, run by Nick Sheridan, between 2000 and 2005. <sup id="fnref:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup>  The company focused on digital signage rather than electronic books. E Ink, a spinoff from MIT, was the first to explore electronic paper’s potential for digital publishing. Philips, the Dutch electronics company attained an exclusive license to E Ink’s technology until the mid-2000s, but once the promise of ‘radio paper’ failed to materialize, other companies including Sony and Amazon licensed the technology to develop their own e-readers.</p>
<p>Unlike other parts of the ebook imagination integrated into ebookness, the vision of a paper-like display technology remains in flux. Dedicated e-readers were largely replaced by smartphones and tablet computers. Since electrophoretic displays are optimized to not refresh, e-readers struggle to compete with other mobile computers’ versatility. Despite the lack of major breakthroughs a decade after the Kindle’s launch, research and development labs still continue to prototype more sophisticated ebook display technology. Electrowetting is currently the most viable solution. The technology was unveiled by Philips in a 2003 letter to  <em>Nature</em>  by a team that would later spin off to Liquavista, which was acquired by Samsung before an eventual takeover by Amazon. Robert Hayes and B.J. Feenstra hyped the technology by suggesting  “our display principle utilizes the voltage-controlled movement of a colored oil film adjacent to a white substrate”   <sup id="fnref:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup>. The use of fluid allowed for faster refresh times and more complex color arrangements where electrophoretic technology is largely stuck with sixteen shades of grey. Replicating the strongest benefits of both paper and screens remains out of reach within current technological paradigms. Nonetheless, despite the general move to a more pragmatic model of ebookness, the ebook imagination remains strong for next-generation electronic paper as the ideals of  “Radio Paper”  remain unfulfilled. The near simultaneous announcement of bendable screen phones from Samsung and Huawei in February 2019 demonstrates how elements of this idealized form of electronic paper dating back to Xerox PARC remain pervasive despite the diminished use of dedicated e-reader <sup id="fnref:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup>. Inventors such as Pei-Yu Chiou and his colleagues at University California-Los Angeles continue to patent electrowetting techniques and related technologies that, alongside bendable screens, have the potential to create something more akin to ‘Radio Paper’ that might convert ebook sceptics <sup id="fnref:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup>. The ebook imagination has outlived the mainstream acceptance and subsequent ambivalence around dedicated e-readers, demonstrating the continued yearning for a more sophisticated form of reading on screen.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sony and Amazon’s appropriation of electronic paper was pivotal to the transition of the ebook imagination from the conceptual ebook based on time-based media or facsimile to a more nuanced response to the affordances of the printed codex. The display technology provided the most accurate simulation of print while requiring minimal battery power. The decision encouraged the rapid adoption of ebooks, but the reliance on a technology originally designed for digital advertising created a divide between the ebook imagination and commercial hardware. An evolutionary approach to histories of ebooks prioritizes a series of commercial hardware releases at the expense of a longer, more diverse history of experimentation . The dominance of Amazon, Apple, and Kobo has created a homogenized version of the ebook with a standardized hardware interface. The ebook imagination as evidenced in patent filings reveals how diverse inventors attempted to create an alternative using the most prominent technologies of the day. Ruiz Robles saw the educational use of interactive mechanical devices, while Brown and Stoyanoff wanted to explore the connection between time-based media and speed-reading. These functions have been incorporated more broadly into ebook reading software such as the Kindle’s Word Runner function, albeit eluding dedicated hardware due to the constraints of electronic paper.</p>
<p>While previous scholarship on the development of ebooks focused on shifts in publishers’ workflows and the emergence of e-readers, I have demonstrated a longer, often cyclical, history of reading on-screen that extends beyond the digital computer to earlier innovations in screen-based media. Patent filings recording the ebook imagination could not predict the Kindle’s successful combination of electronic paper, lithium-ion batteries, and 3G cellular technology. Their greatest strength remains documenting an iterative process of developing the mechanical book from microfilm to the emergence of portable computers in the 1980s. The evidence of ‘failed’ inventions that never made it to market contradicts the dominant narrative within histories of the ebook that laud the Sony Data Discman or Kindle as necessary interventions in publishing’s natural evolution. The patents discussed in this article instead show a longer history of experimentation that mirrors the medial affordances and limitations of their historical context. Reclaiming these lost histories emphasizes the role of marginalized figures including, but not limited to, non-Anglophone women such as Ángela Ruiz Robles who designed her mechanical encyclopedia for educational purposes rather than the market-driven vision of Amazon and its competitors.</p>
<p>Moving towards a cyclical rather than linear understanding of digital publishing’s historical development allows scholars to recontextualize the ebook’s supposed plateau since the late 2010s. Despite the maturation of e-reader hardware since the launch of the Kindle in 2007, ebooks are often seen as inferior to print publications, partially due to a perceived unfulfilled potential. This is the gap between ebookness (the current state of the technology) and the ebook imagination that is still driven by futuristic depictions of digital reading as found in science fiction and patent filings. As long as hardware does not match the expectations of these depictions, the malaise will continue. It is more profitable to reverse this thinking and return to the cyclical nature of innovation and previous failures to determine the overall feasibility of the technologies and the constraints that have held inventors back. A more grounded approach to this history and the current state of ebooks shows the pragmatic approach is better than the fantastical.</p>
<p>In this article, I have also proposed a new approach to the study of the history of digital publishing. Werner and Kirschenbaum conclude that the  “largest challenges [for researching digital publishing] may not be technological but legalistic”   <sup id="fnref:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup>. Examining patents for imagined but not actualized e-readers demonstrates the upside of the legalistic underpinning of digital culture. Future historians of the early twenty-first century book trade will benefit from exploring the USPTO’s rich database further. For example, there are over 10,000 Amazon patents, revealing shifts in corporate priorities. The scarcity of evidence for the history of digital publishing prior to 2000, both physical and virtual, requires alternative approaches to remaining evidence rather than reverting to positivist corporate histories. Through casting a wider net, more stories such as Ángela Ruiz Robles may demonstrate alternative pathways to the current model of digital publishing. A more inclusive perspective on the history, and future, of digital publishing is vital to moving beyond the current impasse of antagonism between print and digital consumption. As I have outlined here, the rich history of the ebook imagination is often limited in technical specifications and with its clear own limitations, but it offers alternative visions to the corporatized platforms currently dominating the book industry.</p>

<p>During the past decade advances in text mining have demonstrated that political issues and topics can be identified from unstructured textual documents with good accuracy. Examples from digital parliamentary studies or computational discourse analysis have brought up evidence how especially topic modelling can be applied on large document corpora to gain overviews over thematic structures of political texts, but also how these structures change over time. Most of these studies analyse large, even huge textual corpora with thousands of lengthy documents. Such big text analysis is often seen as typical example of how digital methods can – even should – be applied in social sciences and the Humanities.</p>
<p>In this article I focus on the problem of using digital methods and tools on a smaller corpus of unstructured textual documents, namely New Year’s addresses, with varying political content and as addressed to a wide public audience, the citizens in general. Although politicians often favour longer speeches and verbal battles when it comes to struggle for political issues, especially the growing relevance of social media driven political communication has strengthened the role of short textual documents like tweets, postings, statements or commentaries in political discourse. Since most short textual contributions are designed to take stand on current affairs and actual political questions, they offer an interesting empirical material to explore not only how politicians take stand on current affairs, but also the structure and dynamics of issue-driven political discourses.</p>
<p>This article is based on the understanding that sort political texts can be a valuable source when it comes to identifying topics and issues that really matter under the current political circumstances. Rising a current topic in a short political text can be seen as an act of politicalisation <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, i.e. an action marking the issue as political by detecting its political potential and thus expanding the presence of the political and presenting a particular representation of reality  <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This is especially relevant for addresses and speeches given by high representatives of a nation like president or prime minister. All issues taken up in such texts are automatically labelled as being politically significant, so that the speech itself can be read as an attempt to persuade the target audience to accept this position <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The empirical results of this article suggest that New Year’s speeches offer a valuable and interesting source for the exploration of topical issues enjoying political and societal relevance. The argument here is rooted in the understanding that if an issue is taken up in a New Year’s address, the issue is considered as important and becomes politicised <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Hence, the corpus of German, Austrian, and Swiss New Year’s speeches offers an interesting source to explore topical discourses from both national and comparative, cross-national perspective.</p>
<p>From the methodological perspective the application of digital text mining and analysis tools on a corpus of short texts consisting of several hundred words in average requires an adapted approach. This, because most tools for text mining have been developed for large-to-huge text corpora with millions of words and use statistical methods to model the corpus. Although these methods produce results also when applied to small corpora, the results tend to be biased and their reliability compromised. In order to circumvent these problems I use a rather novel approach of Text Network Analysis (TNA) using a non-linear approach to re-construct textual documents as a network of words appearing close to each other in the original documents <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. One of the key advantages of TNA is that since TNA is rooted in (Social) Network Analysis the resulting network can be visualised and analysed by methods and tools developed for network analysis. Another advantage is that networks can be created without any arduous preprocessing, although lemmatisation and stopword removal are strongly encouraged. One main objective of this article is the introduction of TNA as an alternative, relatively easy to use explorative tools for both text mining and topic modelling.</p>
<p>The analysis and results presented in this article should evidence the power of TNA as a topic modelling and exploration tool for short(er) text documents. The analysis introduces a non-linear way to analyse texts as networks and to present results based on graphical visualisations making it easier to capture and understand structural characteristics hidden in the corpus. The results, in turn, provide interesting insights in thematic continuity and change in political topics in the analysed three German-speaking countries. Further, a detailed discussion of the results confirm the accuracy of the main findings of my TNA analysis, thus providing additional support for the usefulness of the method.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows. The first main section discusses TNA as an alternative digital tool for topic modelling. The second section introduces the empirical corpus used in this article and describes the data preparation process, as well the analytical steps needed for TNA. The corpus consists of New Year’s addresses given by political leaders in Germany, Switzerland and Austria between 2000 and 2021. All speeches are given in German language. The third section presents and discusses the main findings by reflecting them against contextual factors and previous research. The article is rounded up with concluding remarks critically summarising the main findings and achievements.</p>
<h2 id="2--text-network-analysis">2    Text Network Analysis</h2>
<p>Since the first decade of the 21st century digital research tools and methods have gained a stronger role and impact among social scientists interested in parliamentary debates, political speeches or other textual materials on political affairs. A great majority of such kind of contributions has focused on the identification of the main content through the analysis of commonly used words, by focusing on the content different words as used, or through the analysis of co-occurring words.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>A known challenge with political speeches is that such texts normally tackle several topics or issues. However, changes from one topic to another can be be hard to detect with methods based on a bag-of-words approach. This, because such an approach transforms the document in a word frequency table. Although such a table is rather simple to handle and analyse, the other side of the coin is that such a transformation destroys the original structure of the text, making it impossible to gain understanding about where different words appear in the original text <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> present evidence for an existence of latent shared ideological positions among experts. In this article I expand this underlying assumption to include politicians as well, and make the initial assumption that politicians tend to what I would call thematic recycling, i.e. the endeavour to take up the same – or similar – issues over and over again on different occasions. Hence, a corpus of political textual documents from a politician can be assumed to share similar topics across different documents. Further, as in the case of expert texts we can, with some caution, generalise this assumption and expect to find shared topics by politicians sharing same or highly similar political insights rooted in certain ideological positions. Accordingly, we can expect to find shared latent topics and political positions also in documents delivered by different political actors sharing a similar political landscape.</p>
<p>Thus far most studies dealing with the problem of identifying topics across documents in a document collection have applied methods of topic modelling, mostly Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. There are many good reasons for this, maybe the most important being its flexibility in defining the document, allowing the researcher to condition the topic distribution on paragraphs or time chunks, for example. However, as a method based on statistical modelling LDA also has some important caveats and pitfalls limiting its analytical power especially as regards shorter text documents and smaller corpora. One limitation being highly relevant for this article is that most LDA-based applications require datasets of several hundred documents, at minimum, to ensure validity and reliability of the results <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Although identifying different topics is an interesting challenge of explorative text analysis, this article tackles a bit different challenge: how to explore thematic pathways across documents in a text document corpus. Accordingly, the aim is to explore, on the one hand, how words are used within statements, and how thematically similar statements glue different texts together across contexts, on the other. These thematic pathways building on statements and connecting different contexts should help us to understand the deep thematic backbone underlying the document corpus <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The analysis presented in the next section is an application of Text Network Analysis (TNA), a method originally presented by Paranyushkin (2011) and rooted in theoretical foundations of Social Network Analysis (SNA). According to Paranyushkin TNA seeks to discover  “repetitive patterns derived from the text’s structure, using their connectivity and the intensity of interactions between them as the only criteria for their belonging together”   <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. It is a non-linear approach transforming texts to a network of words by respecting the original structure of the texts. <sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, who use TNA to identify policy frames of nuclear energy policy across different countries, summarise the method by stating that it seeks  “to identify salient words and concepts in order to extract underlying meanings and frames from the structure of concept networks.”  As the contributions of both Paranyushkin and Shim et al. evidence TNA offers a very powerful tool with a robust fundament in network analysis and a rather simple and straightforward application. Further, text networks can be created as flexibly conditioned on e.g. sliding window techniques, sentences, or paragraphs. This gives a researcher additional flexibility to test different approaches to figure out the most suitable text unit for the analysis.</p>
<p>This article stems from the assumption that TNA as a non-linear analysis of textual data could provide us with new ontological understanding about structural coherence and holes within a document corpora. This new ontological understanding, however, is not only expected to shed light on how concepts connect in order to form statements. Instead, it can also help us to explore structures relevant for the understanding of how statements are organised within and across contexts. Through the application of network visualisations and the analysing of structural properties of text networks the underlying data can be explored from alternative perspectives in order to trace back discursive patterns within the text corpus.</p>
<p>One key difference of TNA compared to more traditional tools and techniques of text mining is that TNA understands its input as network data consisting of nodes (or  <em>vertices</em> ) connected by  <em>edges</em>  and having an own structure (topology) <sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. A common technique is to use word-based units – single words or n-grams - as nodes and co-occurrences as edges. Although this is the most common way, nothing actually prevents the researcher from using e.g. phrases as nodes, just to mention another example illustrating the analytical flexibility of TNA. Since TNA works based on network theory, it does not require any predefined ontological structure or pattern of text, nor does it superimpose any extra layer of ontologies on top of the textual data, which may - as <sup id="fnref3:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> correctly states – create  “a strong subjective (and even cultural) bias into the structure of the resulting text graphs.”  Further, the researcher is not limited to the use of text theories or text mining tools (although nothing prevents her to use this kind of theories or tools in the analysis), but can apply a wide range of network analysis tools and methods to explore, analyse and visualise structural properties of the text networks. In other words, TNA gives the researcher the possibility to explore and analyse textual units conditioned to a certain structure and, thus, to explain why different textual units take different positions and roles by focusing on the network structure of the text.</p>
<h2 id="3--data-and-workflow">3    Data and Workflow</h2>
<p>The empirical case study in this article is based on New Year’s speeches of the three German-speaking countries, Germany, Austria and Switzerland<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  covering the years from 2000 to 2021. These three countries were selected, first, based on the shared language providing us the possibility to compare the use of language of high politics across these countries. Second, all three countries belong to the same cultural-political space, Central Europe, with a strong, continental orientation and a centuries-long experience and tradition of German cultural, economic, and political influence, but also dominance <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. Besides the two more or less uniting criteria, the third selection criterion was a dividing factor: Germany and Austria are members in the European Union (EU), whereas Switzerland is only indirectly involved in European integration through its membership in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and a set of bilateral agreements with the EU. Switzerland is also member of the Schengen area allowing any person, irrespective of nationality, to cross the internal borders without being subjected to border checks. Currently, most of the EU countries plus the non-EU countries Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have joined the Schengen area. Against this background I expect these three countries to form an imagined community (Benedict Anderson) and to share certain values, interests and world views reflected by the New Year’s addresses. Further, I expect German and Austrian New Year’s speeches to share discursive patterns related to EU affairs, especially to the euro crisis (since 2008), the conflict in Ukraine (since 2014), and the refugee crisis (since 2015).<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>  I also could explore the impact of the global Covid-19 pandemic disease on both the content and vocabulary across the three countries yet this impact is visible only in the speeches for the year 2021.</p>
<p>New Year’s speeches held by leading politicians–mostly prime ministers or presidents–have a long and firm tradition in Europe and  “have become an institution instead of being a crowing event for conciliatory efforts”   <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. From the perspective of political communication, New Year’s addresses fulfil a triple function in the intersection of the past, the present and the future. First, they summarise the past year from the perspective of the political leadership and, hence, recall, reconstruct and remind the most important events of the year. Second, New Year’s speeches describe the present and, thus, can be understood and analysed as reality constructions, as windows to the current state of affairs. And third, New Year’s speeches serve as road maps to the future, into the new year. In this sense, a New Year’s speeches summarises the most important future challenges, expectations and opportunities.</p>
<p>There exist only a small number of dedicated studies on New Year’s speeches <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. I could not identify any specific reason for this, despite that New Year’s speeches are dominantly given in non-English speaking countries in Europe. As a text genre, however, New Year’s addresses are comparable with the Presidential Inaugural speeches of the U.S. and this article methodologically benefits from the study of <sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> on the United States’ Inaugural Addresses. From the perspective of social sciences I am not primarily interested in the use of language, but issues mentioned and described in the addresses. This viewpoint is rooted in the assumption that a political phenomenon, topic or event gains in importance if mentioned in a New Year’s address. Here I also follow the idea that New Year’s speeches offer insights into shifts in political priorities, interests, and opinions <sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Against this background I am convinced that a longitudinal, computational analysis of German, Austrian and Swiss New Year’s addresses can help us to a better understanding of how the political landscape has changed between 2000 and 2021, but also where the differences and similarities can be found between these three countries.</p>
<p>The speech corpus covers a period of 22 years and contains 64 speeches. There are two missing years – 2002 and 2017 – in the Austrian speech collection. In Austria Federal President delivers the New Year’s speeches and between 2000 and 2004 the speeches were delivered by Thomas Klestil, between 2005 and 2016 by Heinz Fischer, and since 2018 by Alexander Van der Bellen. Although speeches from 2005 onwards can be downloaded from the <a href="www.bundespraesident.at/">official website</a> of the Austrian Federal President. Fortunately, the speeches of 2000-2001 and 2003-2004 could be found in different Austrian media archives. As regards the year 2002, neither the President’s office nor the National Archive of Austria could provide any information about where this particular New Year’s speech could be found, so that I was forced to drop this year from the corpus. In 2017 Austria had an extraordinary political situation with no Federal President in office, so that no New Year’s speech was given.</p>
<p>In Germany, the New Year’s speeches are held by Federal Chancellor and full texts are available on the <a href="www.bundeskanzler.de/">official website</a>.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> . The first six speeches (2000-2005) were held by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, the remaining sixteen from 2006 to 2021 by Chancellor Angela Merkel. In Switzerland, the annual New Year’s speech is delivered by the President of the Confederation and all speeches since 1980 are available online on the <a href="www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/reden/neujahrsansprachen.html">official website</a> of the President of the Confederation. As the term of the Swiss President is just one year all New Year’s speeches are held by a different person (except Micheline Calmy-Rey, Pascal Couchepin and Moritz Leuenberger, all of them re-elected and with two speeches).</p>
<p>Despite the varieties in the use of language in the German-speaking Europe, formal speeches by top-level politicians can be seen as an appropriate source of data, as policy discourses are comprised of policy addresses and speeches about policy issues <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>.</p>

<p>New Year’s speeches are traditionally broadcasted over TV or radio within a relatively short time of 10 to 15 minutes. Consequently, these speeches are relative compact in size. The average speeches length of a German new New Year’s speech was 892 tokens and standard deviation (sd) was 111. In Austria and Switzerland the average lengths were 719 (sd=58) and 562 (sd=159) respectively (Figure 1). Quite understandably the amount of unique tokens is somewhat lower, since certain words are used several times during a speech. For German New Year’s addresses, there were 362 unique tokens in average (sd=33), for Austrian and Swiss speeches the average number of unique tokens was 317 (sd=27) and 255 (sd=60) respectively. Swiss New Year’s speeches seem to have become shorter over time, whereas both German and Austrian New Year’s speeches remain relative stable over time (Figure 1). Generally speaking a country’s size seem to matter here, as German New Year’s speeches are slightly longer than the Austrian or Swiss addresses. My explanation for this observed difference stems from the differences in political and economic importance. Germany’s central role in European politics results in broader political agenda, so that there are more issues and topics to be addressed to in a New Year’s address.</p>
<p>As regards the analysis workflow, all collected speeches were saved in separate files in plain text format. These files were then imported into <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, a graphical end-user environment for the statistical <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">package R</a>. The research data was created and analysed in the four steps. First, I used the package ’udpipe’<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  to tokenise, part-of-speech tag, and lemmatise the documents. After this step, the data was structured as a data table consisting of 53893 words and 5277 unique lemmata, enriched with descriptive metadata about the country and the year, as well sentence indices. In the third step, I used text mining and explorative data analysis tools from the package <a href="https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/">’tidytext’</a> to carry out different text analyses and to transform textual data to different sets of text network data. The applied text mining methods will be described in the next section. For the text network network creation I used both bi-grams by linking two consecutive words, as well skipgrams of length two by combining non-adjacent words that were three, four or five words apart.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  Both the bi-grams and skipgrams were created within the boundaries of the same sentence based on the sentence index included in the data structure. (2) in the case of concepts used in a single country, only concepts which occur more than three times are included. Text networks were visualised and analysed with ’visone’, a fully-fledged, platform independent software offering powerful layouts for network visualisations and a comprehensive set of tools for network manipulation, <a href="visone.info/html/about.html">transformation and analysis</a>.</p>

In the network visualisation nodes represent different New Years speeches and are coloured with country-specific colours so that German addresses are coloured with yellow, Austrian with red, and Swiss speeches with white. I have also added labels to help the reader to identify different addresses. Nodes are connected by edges, of which width is visualised proportional to the cosine measure of the two speeches connected by that edge. In my data the cosine measures ranged from 0.103 (between the Swiss speeches 2006 and 2020) to 0.641 (between the German speeches 2009 and 2010), but I have removed edges with cosine measure below 0.400 in order to improve the readability of the network visualisation. Further, I used a force-directed layout and optimised it to position speeches with higher similarity closer, those with lesser to each other so that the clusters of more similar speeches are easier to identify.</p>
<p>As regards the similarity network two observations seem appropriate. First, the New Year’s speeches evidence a stronger similarity within, and weaker similarity across countries. This is clearly visible in the network structure as well, as speeches from different countries form clear and distinct cluster in the visualisation (see Figure 2). Overall, the average similarity for cross-country speeches is 0.318 (min=0.114, max=0.514), for national speeches the average similarity is 0.384 (min=0.103, max=0.614). If we set the threshold value for cosine measure to 0.5, only two cross-national combinations, namely Austria 2018 – Switzerland 2020 (0.505) and Germany 2014 – Switzerland 2018 (0.514), exceed this limit. Varieties of national political agenda and circumstances seem to explain these observed differences, thus underlining the primacy of national topical issues. An interesting result is also that the cosine similarity between German and Austrian speeches is significantly higher (mean=0.355) than that between German/Austrian and Swiss speeches (mean=0.277). This difference is at least partly explained by the EU membership, as certain topical issues both German and Austrian speeches tackle are connected to EU politics.</p>
<p>And second, similarity seems to be stronger between between chronologically close speeches and weaker between speeches with greater temporal distance. I tested this with a simple Pearson’s correlation test and calculated the correlation between the cosine measure and the temporal distance in years between the New Year’s addresses. The correlation was -0.085 (p&lt;0.001), thus confirming the hypothesis that the similarity measure decreases when the temporal distance between compared speeches increases. This seems logical when reflected against the fact that New Year’s speeches tackle topical issues at the end of a year. The longer the temporal distance between two addresses, the more probable there has been significant changes in political circumstances affecting the vocabulary used in the addresses. Hence, this observation also gives support to the argument that New Year’s speeches offer an interesting and valuable perspective on a year’s prevailing political reality.</p>

        <p>The 20 most important words per country in different periods (tf-idf analysis).
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Results from the document-level TNA suggested the existence of variance in vocabulary between the countries and over time. In order to better understand this variance I applied a specific text mining method, called term frequency, inverse document frequency (tf-idf) analysis, to adjust the frequency of a word for how rarely it is used in the collection of New Year’s speeches of each country. A word’s inverse document frequency (idf) was then applied to explore words that are not used very much during the whole period from 2000 to 2021. I divided each national collection of New Year’s speeches into three distinct periods of 2000-2009, 2010-2019, and 2020-2021. Here the idea was to capture changes in the vocabulary over time within a country, most probably caused by changes in topical issues or political circumstances. The results of this tf-idf analysis are presented in Figure 3. In this barplot we can see for each country the most important words in each distinct period of time. Hence, the Figure 3 highlights temporal changes within each country, but preserves national differences. In my opinion three central findings from this analysis are worth being discussed in detail.</p>
<p>First, the connection to topical political issues and circumstances is especially evident in Germany across the time periods, but also clearly visible in Austrian speeches of the last two periods. As regards Germany, during the first period (2000-2009) words like wiederaufbau (rebuilding), betroffen (upset), and mitgefühl (sympathy, compassion), together with such words like naturkatastrophe (natural disaster), region (region), or erschüttern (shock, shake) belonging to the top-30 tf-idf words in this period, tackle the 2002 European flood. Germany was the hardest hit country in Europe and the flood resulted in heated political discussions in the eve of the Federal elections 2002. In Austrian speeches of this period words like jahrhudert (century), katastrophe (catastrophe), and hilfsbereitschaft (helpfulness) document the presence of the 2002 flood – which hit also Austria quite severely – also in Austrian political discourses.</p>
<p>Another issue in this period was the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone in 2008/2009. This economic crisis is present in German speeches through words like globalisierung (globalisation), wirtschaft (economy), arbeitslosigkeit, (unemployment). Contrary to Germany, the eurozone crisis is not very present and visible in Austrian speeches in this period of time. A possible explanation to this difference might be found in the different roles the two countries played in the early stage of the eurozone crisis. Germany as the strongest economy in the eurozone played a central, designing role from the very beginning of the eurozone crisis <sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup>, whereas Austria were not strongly hit by, nor a central player in this crisis. In addition to that I would also stress the economy-oriented political culture in Germany. The strong role of economic questions as a central shaping factor of German domestic and European politics increases the weight of topical economic issues in public debates. Against this background it is not surprisingly that the eurozone crisis occupied a more significant space in public debates in German compared to Austria <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>
<p>During the second period (2010-2019) the focus of German New Year’s speeches shifts from economy to refugee politics. In 2015 Chancellor Merkel decided to keep German state borders open to refugees coming mainly from the Middle East. Although this political turn was captured in positive political slogans like Willkommenskultur (culture of welcoming) or – most prominently – Wir schaffen das (we can do it/ we manage it), the fact that words like flüchtling (refugee), zusammenhalt (sticking together), herausforderung (challenge), außengrenze (outer border), or aufnehmen (receive, welcome) are among the top-20 terms underline the change the refugee crisis caused in German public and political discourses during this period of 2010-2019. From the methodological point of view the identification of terms with a clear connection to the refugee crisis evidence the usefulness of tf-idf analysis when it comes to explore discursive changes. Contrary to Germany, the refugee crisis was not central in Austrian New Year’s addresses. Instead, the national political and economic setting seem to dominate Austrian addresses. Terms like marktwirtschaft (market economy), lebensqualität (quality of life), or finanz(finance) tackle economic consequences of the eurozone crisis. The word politikverdrossenheit (jadedness with politics) refers to domestic political turbulences behind the rise of the right-wing populist Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) in the mid-2010s. Although this rise was partly supported by the refugee crisis, it was also an expression of disillusionment with the political elite.</p>
<p>Second, as expected the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic disease in Europe in the first half of 2020 resulted in a clear change, especially as regards the German and Austrian New Year’s addresses. Words like pandemie (pandemic), impfung/impfstoff (vaccination), abstand (distance), or corona (coronavirus) poke from the results as indicators for this discursive change in political and public discourse in Germany and Austria. Once again, the results also confirm the usefulness of tf-idf analysis for the exploration of discursive changes through changes in vocabulary over time.</p>
<p>And third, the overall results confirm the hypothesis that Germany and Austria are, what comes to political agenda and circumstances, as well to topical issues, closer to each other than to Switzerland. It is, however, a somewhat odd observation that Swiss speeches seem to  <em>avoid</em>  topical political issues and to concentrate on the construction of neutral narratives. A possible explanation for this might be found in the fact that in Switzerland, as opposed to Germany and Austria, the federal president giving the New Year’s speech is not the head of state, but just the head of Switzerland’s Federal Council, and only carries out some representative duties. Hence, the federal president is merely a mediator between the different parts of the Swiss federal state.</p>
<p>The results presented thus far indicate two main aspects. First, New Year’s addresses offer a valuable and reliable source to explore topical issues and tackle changes in political and public discourses. And second, although the national political agenda and circumstances seem to have a stronger impact on the content of the addresses, significant European political incidents and events, e.g. the refugee crisis or the Covid-19 pandemic disease, seem to cause changes across countries. This leads us to the final analysis, an attempt to explore shared topics. For this analysis I constructed text networks based on bigrams, i.e. word co-occurrences of two adjacent words, and of skipgrams, i.e. combinations of two non-adjancent words that are three to five words apart <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. The bi- and skipgrams were created for words occurring within the same paragraph. Since the idea is to analyse topics across countries all word pairs co-occurring in New Year’s speeches of one single country only were removed. In the last step I calculated a co-occurrence weight measure by dividing the number of speeches a word pair co-occurs by the total number of speeches (64) in the multi-national corpus. The interpretation of this weight measure is rather straightforward: the higher the value, the more significant the word pair for the cross-country content.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 4 visualises word co-occurrences network across countries based on bigrams, whereas Figure5 visualises word co-occurrence network across countries based on skipgrams. Hence, both visualised text networks present shared word co-occurrences central for the multi-country corpus of German, Austrian, and Swiss New Year’s addresses, i.e. word pairs that can be interpreted as fundamental for the – put in Benedict Anderson’s (1991) famous terminology – imagined discursive community of these three German-speaking countries. The bigram-based core text network consists of 336 words and 565 co-occurrences, whereas the skipgram-based core text network consists of 423 words and 1157 co-occurrences.</p>
<p>In order to visually highlight the most important structural properties both visualisations apply identical visualisation effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Node size is mapped to the node’s degree centrality value and node label size is mapped the nodes betweenness centrality measure. In network theory centrality, in general, indicates a node’s position in the network and can be calculated either relative to a node’s direct neighbours or the whole network. A node’s degree is the simplest centrality measure and equals to the number of connections the node has to other nodes. Betweenness, as the term itself indicates, defines centrality by analysing where a node is placed within the network. Consequently, a node’s betweenness centrality score is computed by taking into consideration the rest of the network and by looking at how many times a node sits on the shortest path linking two other nodes together, thus helping to identify nodes having  “a high probability of occurring on a randomly chosen shortest path between two randomly chosen vertices”   <sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>. Considering meaning circulation across the entire network, the latter capability is assumed to be more relevant, since betweenness centrality  “shows the variety of contexts where the word appears, while high degree shows the variety of words next to which the word appears”   <sup id="fnref4:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This difference is important to keep in mind and therefore I use betweenness centrality to measure a concept’s general status in the text network. As both <sup id="fnref5:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref2:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> point out concepts with high betweenness and degree centrality play a meaning circulation role across texts in the document corpus, whereas concepts with low centrality measures are peripheral concepts and, thus, typical only for a certain part of documents. Between these two extremes are located concepts with high betweenness but low degree centrality and concepts with low betweenness but high degree centrality. The former play an important role as bridging concepts between local communities, the latter, in turn, are local hubs within a cluster <sup id="fnref3:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This mapping strategy allows us to easily identify the most important and influential words in the graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Node colour is mapped to the topic cluster the node belongs to. One of the proposed key advantages of TNA is bound with the possibility to exploit network community detection techniques.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>  The underlying idea here is that when textual documents are reconstructed as text networks a word’s position in the network is not random but determined relative to the context it appears in. Consequently, words belonging to the same (or similar) context are assumed to cluster across documents, so that we could be able to identify groups of words in the network structure having dense connections  <em>within</em>  the group, but sparse connections to other parts of the text next. These groups are here interpreted as topics describing the main thematic content of the document corpus. By leaning on the promising results of <sup id="fnref6:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref4:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> I applied a modularity-based community detection method called  “Louvain method”  based on the assumption, that nodes being more densely connected together than with the rest of the network construct a network community <sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. The method identified in total 13 clusters - in my interpretation: topics - in the bigram-based and 12 topics in the skipgram-based text network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edge width is mapped to the weight of the co-occurrence of the word pair. The more often two words co-occur in the document corpus, the wider the connecting edge is visualised in the network graph. Since the graph includes only word pairs shared by at least two countries, edge effects help us to identify word pairs used together frequently across countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Layout used for the visualisation is a radar-like centrality layout, in which a node’s position is determined by its topic cluster and links are arranged according to their weights. The underlying idea of this layout is to gather nodes belonging to the same cluster on the same circumference. Further, the visualisation makes also connections between the clusters – i.e. word pairs, of which words belong to different topic clusters – easier to identify. As regards the meaning circulation across the multi-country text network word pairs connecting two topics can be analysed from the perspective of structural holes. These connections bridging two separate topics by closing a structural hole in a network can make us aware of possibly existing latent similarities between these two topics <sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Most important topics in the New Year’s speeches across countries.     Bigram text network core communities  (Total # of clusters: 13, modularity: 0.55)          <em>Cluster</em>        <em>Core content words of the topic</em> (a)         _#1: Solidarity / Sense of community _ (55 words in total)  bürgerin/bürger, frieden, geschichte, hilfbereitschaft, sicherheit, stabilität, verantwortung, wiederaufbau, zukunft, zusammenhalt         _#2: Crisis recovery _ (41)  einsetzen, ereignis, erinnern, freuen, generation, glauben, krise, verbinden, weltkrieg, überwinden         _#3: Covid-19 era _ (36)  erfolgreich, familie, friedlich, meistern, pandemie, phase, resignation, schwierig, zeit, zusammenleben         _#4: Europe _ (32)  entwicklung, erweiterung, europäisch, hoffnung, krieg, mitgliedstaat, parlament, terror, union, wählen       Skipgram text network core communities   (Total # of clusters: 12, modularity: 0.35)          <em>Cluster</em>        <em>Core content words of the topic</em> (a)         _#1: Crisis recovery _ (62 words in total)  erinnerung, friedlich, krieg, mauer, notwendig, optimismus, pandemie, vergessen, verlust, wirtschaftskrise         _#2: Faith in the future _ (51)  aufschwung, bemühen, gestaltung, neugier, selbstvertrauen, technik, wirklichkeit, wissenschaft, zufriedenheit, zuversicht         _#3: Economy _ (46)  arbeitsplatz, beitrag, einsatz, erreichen, global, idee, leisten, offen, unternehmen, wirtschaft         _#4: Solidarity / Sense of community _ (45)  alltag, bürgerin/bürger, demokratie, entwicklung, familie, frieden, gemeinsam, gemeinschaft, stehen, welt   <br>
(a) Core content words include ten (10) most influental words relative to the topic of the cluster (listed in alphabetical order). Bold words indicate top ranking words both in degree and betweenness centrality, i.e. words being central for meaning circulation across the text network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Table 1 summarises the most significant results of the community detection analysis of both the bigram based and the skipgram based text network by focusing on the four largest communities found by the Louvain algorithm. As expected there is some variance across topics between the bigram and skipgram networks. I consider this variation as normal when the differences in network data creation is taken into account. Actually, against this background, the two networks should not be considered as exclusionary but complementary to each other. I have given each community a descriptive label based on a manual evaluation of the vocabulary linked to the community.</p>
<p>There are two shared topics. I have labelled the first Solidarity / Sense of community and it is the largest topic in the bigram and fourth largest topic in the skipgram text network. Both includes words bürger/bürgerin (citizen) and frieden (peace). In the bigram network this topic is with respect to content more focused on helpfulness and security, indicated through words like hilfebereitschaft (helpfulness), sicherheit (security), stabilität (stability), verantwortung (responsibility), and zusammenhalt (togetherness, solidarity). The skipgram network, in turn, has in this topic a stronger bias towards democracy and society embodied by words like alltag (everyday life), demokratie (democracy), familie (family), and gemeinschaft (community).</p>
<p>This topic appears in different contexts over time. In the German New Year’s speech in 2006 the topic is used to emphasise the inter-linkages between Germany and the international, global community:<br>
<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deutschland ist keine Insel. Wir stehen in einem internationalen Qualitätswettbewerb, der alle Bereiche unseres Zusammenlebens betrifft: Welcher Nation gelingt es am besten, die schöpferischen Kräfte ihrer Menschen zu wecken? Wie offen ist eine Gesellschaft für Neues? Was bietet sie jungen Familien? In welchem Land gibt es die besten Schulen und Hochschulen? Wie gut gelingt das Miteinander von Einheimischen und Zuwanderern?<br>
<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/service/archiv?query=neujahrsansprache">Germany 2006</a><br>
In the German speech of 2015, the topic is used in the context of the refugee crisis to foster solidarity among citizens, but also to strengthen confidence and commitment to the community and its values:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Genauso klar ist: Nur mit offenen Diskussionen und Debatten können wir Lösungen finden, die langfristig Bestand haben und von Mehrheiten getragen werden. Wir sind es, die Bürger und ihre gewählten Repräsentanten, die entwickeln und verteidigen werden, was dieses unser liberales und demokratisches Land so lebenswert und liebenswert macht. Wir sind es, die Lösungen finden werden, die unseren ethischen Normen entsprechen, und den sozialen Zusammenhalt nicht gefährden. Lösungen, die das Wohlergehen der eigenen Bürger berücksichtigen, aber nicht die Not der Flüchtlinge vergessen.<br>
<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/service/archiv?query=neujahrsansprache">Germany 2015</a><br>
The Austrian speech of 2007, in turn, highlights the role of persons in different positions of trust for the security, stability and confidence of the community:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lassen Sie mich abschließend die Gelegenheit benutzen, um den vielen Frauen und Männern herzlich zu danken, die in den verschiedensten Funktionen für unser Gemeinwohl, für unsere Sicherheit, für unsere Gesundheit und für den Zusammenhalt unserer Gesellschaft buchstäblich oft Tag und Nacht beruflich, oder auch als freiwillige Helferinnen und Helfer tätig sind. Der Wert dessen, was hier geleistet wird, kann gar nicht hoch genug eingeschätzt werden.<br>
<a href="https://www.bundespraesident.at/aktuelles/page">Austria 2007</a><br>
And finally, the following two quotes from the Swiss speeches of 2017 and 2021 establish connections between the economic welfare, sovereignty and stability of the country and the solidarity and togetherness of the society:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stabil und erfolgreich wollen wir auch in Zukunft sein. Dazu braucht es mehr denn je den Zusammenhalt. Unsere Gesellschaft ist stark, weil wir erprobt sind im Versöhnen von Ansprüchen.<br>
<a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/reden/neujahrsansprachen.html">Switzerland 2017</a><br>
Wir Schweizerinnen und Schweizer müssen zusammenstehen. Nur so können wir als Land einstehen für die Interessen von uns allen: für unsere Gesundheit und unser wirtschaftliches Wohlergehen, für Frieden und Verbundenheit, für Freiheit und Unabhängigkeit, – kurz: für alles, was uns seit Langem lieb und teuer ist.<br>
<a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/reden/neujahrsansprachen.html">Switzerland 2021</a><br>
The second shared topic is labelled Crisis recovery. The content vocabulary of this topics indicates that this topic is not limited to the Covid-19 pandemic disease only. Instead, this topic seems to be used over time to embed a current, topical crisis into a wider, historical context. Although the clustering algorithm allocates topical words like pandemie (pandemic) or wirtschaftskrise (financial crisis) to this cluster, in my interpretation other content words like generation (generation), krieg / weltkrieg (war / world war), überwinden (overcome), optimismus (optimism), mauer (wall), and erinnern (remember) stand for this wider historical context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both in the Swiss speech in 2010 and German speech in 2011 this topic was used to frame the eurozone crisis. Both quotations manifest a clear optimism that the crisis has been successfully fought and the country will recover rather quickly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wir verfügen über eine starke Wirtschaft und eine solide Finanzpolitik. Wir haben es geschafft, trotz grosser Wirtschaftskrise die Schulden nicht übermässig wachsen zu lassen. Das wird uns im Aufschwung stärken.<br>
<a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/reden/neujahrsansprachen.html">Switzerland 2010</a><br>
Deutschland hat die Krise wie kaum ein anderes Land gemeistert. Was wir uns vorgenommen hatten, das haben wir auch geschafft: Wir sind sogar gestärkt aus der Krise herausgekommen. Und das ist vor allem Ihr Verdienst, liebe Mitbürgerinnen und Mitbürger.<br>
<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/service/archiv?query=neujahrsansprache">Germany 2011</a> <br>
In 2020, the Austrian speech used this topic in a totally different context combining the most important crises and challenges of the current time, i.e. climate change, digitalisation, and migration, as well questions related to gender equality and welfare state reforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Zur Klimakrise kommen weitere große Herausforderungen: Wie werden wir künftig arbeiten? Welche Antworten geben wir in Österreich auf die Digitalisierung? Wie soll sich unser Wirtschaftsstandort entwickeln? Wie gehen wir mit Migration um? Und was tun wir, um Frauenrechte zu stärken? Haben wir ausreichend drüber nachgedacht, das Nötige im Bildungsbereich anzugehen? Welche Reformen sind im Gesundheits- und Sozialsystem notwendig, um soziale Sicherheit und sozialen Zusammenhalt für die Zukunft zu gewährleisten?<br>
<a href="https://www.bundespraesident.at/aktuelles/page">Austria 2020</a> <br>
Both text networks produce also distinct topics. In the bigram network we can identify the unique topics labelled by myself Covid-19 era and Europe, in the skipgram network such topics include Faith in the future and Economy. As regards the bigram-specific topics, Covid-19 era not only embodies the strenuousness of the pandemic disease by content words like pandemie (pandemic), resignation (resignation), or the word combination schwierig + zeit (hard times), but also seeks to create hope through words like erfolgreich (successful), familie (family), meistern (control), zusammenleben (life together). The topic Europe, in turn, tackles both current European issues like terrorism (terror), European parliamentary elections (wählen (vote), parlament (parliament)) and European integration as a wider context (europäisch + union (EU), erweiterung (enlargement), mitgliedstaat (member state)). This latter topic clearly evidences the role and status of the EU as the most important political, economic, and geographical context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The topic Covid-19 era is a mixture of resignation and hope. The Austrian speech in 2021 well exemplifies this mixture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ein neues Jahr liegt vor uns. Wir spüren noch die Last des alten, die Last der Pandemie. Aber viele von uns spüren trotz allem eine hoffnungsfrohe Erwartung, wie sie nur am Beginn von etwas Neuem stehen kann, wenn alle Möglichkeiten offen und alle Träume noch frisch sind.<br>
<a href="https://www.bundespraesident.at/aktuelles/page">Austria 2021</a> <br>
The German address, in turn, acknowledges the dramatic changes caused by the Covid-19 pandemic disease. At the same, however, the quotation has a positive trait, stressing the supportive and stabilising role of the federal state in the times of crisis:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Die Aufgaben, vor die die Pandemie uns stellt, bleiben gewaltig. Bei vielen Gewerbetreibenden, Arbeitnehmern, Solo-Selbstständigen und Künstlern herrschen Unsicherheit, ja Existenzangst. Die Bundesregierung hat sie in dieser ganz unverschuldeten Notlage nicht allein gelassen. Staatliche Unterstützung in nie dagewesener Höhe hilft. Verbesserte Kurzarbeitsregeln greifen. Arbeitsplätze können so bewahrt werden.<br>
<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/service/archiv?query=neujahrsansprache">Germany 2021</a><br>
Contrary to Austria and Germany, the Swiss speech of 2021 is marked by negative ambience, even resignation underlining the deep societal impact the Covid-19 pandemic disease has caused in Switzerland:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

The topic Europe is mostly used, as the following quotations exemplify, to remind the citizens about the fundamental importance of European integration as a uniting community of Europeans, but also as provider for economic and political security in a global world:</p>

Within the skipgram network, the topic Faith in the future represents a strong faith in technological and scientific development as the most important fundament for a better future. This is especially evident when we consider such content words like technik (technology), wissenschaft (science), aufschwung (boom, economic expansion), selbstvertrauen (self-confidence), and zuversicht (confidence). Interestingly, this topic also contains words with strong, dynamic connotation to the shaping the future (gestaltung) and the putting oneself out (bemühen). How this topic is used to generate optimism towards the future is well illustrated by the following quotations:</p>

Finally, the topic Economy is characterised by very concrete, economic content words like arbeitsplatz (job, post), global (global[isation]), unternehmen (company), and wirtschaft (economy). But this topic also has a forward-looking content embodied by words like erreichen (reach), idee (idea), or leisten (perform). An excellent example of how this topic is present in the speeches is the following quotation from the German speech of 2008: Deutschland kann seine alte Kraft als das Land der Sozialen Marktwirtschaft wieder neu unter Beweis stellen, der Verbindung von Freiheit und Gerechtigkeit, Fleiß und Unternehmergeist. The same spirit can be found in the following Austrian and Swiss addresses:</p>

Overall, the topics identified by the Louvain method seem appropriate and reliable in the context of these three countries. The main topics discussed above not only connect well to the political and economic reality in these countries or in Europe in more general terms, but also evidence that TNA tools offer – as the previous studies of <sup id="fnref7:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref3:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, or <sup id="fnref5:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> already suggest – a reliable alternative to traditional methods of text mining. Further, the differences between topics identified in the bigram and the skipgram based network seem to give support to the study of <sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> that the complementary use of both methods can help us to reliably identify topics that use similar vocabulary but show differences in the text structure. And finally, it is worth being noted that the most important content words of each topic contain only a few words with both a high degree centrality and a high betweenness centrality. This means that the most important content words are those enjoying higher relevance within the topic and, thus, are descriptive for the topic. A closer look at words used for meaning circulation across topics and countries reveals that these words include words related to peace (frieden, friedlich) and war (krieg), security (sicherheit), crisis (krise), community (gemeinschaft), economy (wirtschaft), and future (zukunft). All these glueing words are less topical and more contextual, thus framing and embedding the topical issues into a wider context of European (integration) history.</p>

<h2 id="5--discussion">5    Discussion</h2>
<p>This article has sought to exemplify the utility of text network analysis as a computational method for exploratory text and content analysis. Further, in the leaning on similar previous studies, this article also understands TNA as an promising and powerful alternative to traditional methods of topic modelling, especially to LDA. Against the background of these objectives and based on the results of the empirical analysis the following three conclusions are worth being discussed.</p>
<p>First, one major objective of this article was to present and evidence the usefulness of computational, exploratory text analysis for gaining new insights of the structure and dynamics of a collection of short textual documents. In this respect, the results are promising. Especially I would like to highlight the possibilities of using network clustering methods for the exploration of topics hidden in the corpus. As the result indicate, network clustering algorithms can identify contextually meaningful and relevant clusters. As I have shown the applied approach can help the researcher to identify appropriate text passages for different topics, serving as a starting point for an in-depth context analysis.</p>
<p>Second, results from the empirical analysis evidence the analytical power of the two computational methods applied. On the one hand, the rather traditional tf-idf method helped to gain insights and a better understanding of changes over time and of differences between the three countries. By increasing the weight of words that are more common in a certain period I could tackle changes in the content of the speeches over time. On the other hand, TNA proved to be a rather simple, yet powerful alternative to traditional topic modelling methods. The validation of the results of the community detection against samples from the original sources showed that the identified clusters not only had a meaningful content relevant for all countries, but they also were, according to their modularity values, valid and reliable. The two methods, when applied in a complementary manner, were very useful in identifying changes in the content over time and across nations, but also in exploring topics binding these three countries together. Here we could also identify one clear difference between the three countries. For Germany and Austria Europe seem to play an important role and many speeches reflected the fundamental importance of Europe, especially the European Union, as  <em>the</em>  political, economic, and historical context for both countries. Swiss New Year’s speeches remain somewhat abstract and globally oriented in this respect, thus reflecting the long tradition of the neutral Swiss foreign policy <sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p>
<p>Third, although the results are encouraging both in empirical and methodological sense, the limitations of text network analysis need to be addressed. As Diesner et al. (2012) points out, validation of the results can be difficult for densely connected large-scale networks. Further, techniques for text preprocessing, node identification, and link construction must be decided before mining network structure from text data, since these decisions  “could strongly influence the structure of resulting networks”   <sup id="fnref6:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. As a comparison of the bigram and skipgram networks evidenced, different methods of network data creation may produce different results, so that data preprocessing and network analysis techniques should be selected with care and be closely aligned with research questions and objectives.</p>
<p>Overall, the analysis presented in this article is well in line with these previous works and supportive for the idea that text network analysis could offer an interesting alternative method for computational content analysis. Since the method seems to work quite reliable also with smaller data sets I can only encourage colleagues interested in this kind of analysis to test TNA tools.</p>

<p>Networks are some of the most commonly found visualizations in digital humanities research. Used to represent relationships between persons or concepts, this type of graphs has also been implemented through various layouts to better support specific tasks and users.</p>
<p>The wide availability of layout algorithms has multiple advantages for researchers who aim to analyze social networks. Force-directed layouts such as the Gephi Atlas drastically simplify the visualization – therefore analysis – of large network data. They reveal patterns and clusters by using complex physical models, all with limited need for user intervention or mathematical expertise. These models excel in domains where datasets are large, and where the goal is to identify the structure – or shape – of the dataset.</p>
<p>However, the widened access to these automated graph drawing algorithms drives us to interrogate their fitedness for the analysis of humanistic material. On the one hand, force-directed layouts visually remove existing structures in the data, even when these structures are meaningful to users and their daily tasks. On the other, humanistic datasets are often small, but do consist of meaningful inherent clusters, distances and relationships. Such a mismatch leads to representations that can be at odds with users&rsquo; internal perceptions of the data structure. For instance, family members in a correspondence graph are likely to be spread apart. Similarly, non-contemporary actors can be placed side to side if they share a common correspondent. This inconsistency between mental models and visual representation can become a challenge for users. More critically, it has the potential to impact the adoption of visualization tools as a whole as research suggests usability and user trust, rather than scalability, are main obstacles to adoption of digital tools in the humanities <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing Force-Layered graphs: a novel method for drawing hierarchical graphs<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>  using force-directed layout. This method uses the existing – and already mature - dynamics of force-directed algorithms, and injects a meaningful structure into them to organize them in a way that better supports users’ mental models. We describe the results of a mixed-methods user study exploring the effect of visual hierarchy for users with humanities background.</p>
<p>Our initial results reveal that force-layered graph layout outperforms force-directed layout in terms of number and depth of insights, cognitive load reduction, and user preference. We discuss these findings along with implications for design and future directions for this line of research. Specifically, we interrogate the artificial structure these layouts create, and evaluate whether their disconnect with existing data hierarchies affects user understanding, preference, and experience.</p>
<h2 id="structure--hierarchy-in-network-visualization">Structure &amp; Hierarchy in Network Visualization</h2>
<p>Discussion about the semantics of visual design elements is often neglected within technical scholarship on information visualization. In the case of hierarchy, we believe this discussion to be critical for two reasons. First, because Human-Computer-Interaction research has shown the importance of the consistency between users’ mental models of information and its digital representation <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Second, because visual hierarchy in network graphs strongly affects their spatial organization, and spatial position is believed to be one of the most effective channels in information visualization <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. In this section, we present a discussion on the semantics of hierarchical trees on one side, and force-directed networks on the other.</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First, we illustrate the difference between the two, through the example of two visualisations of historical social networks as can be seen in Figure 1. In Figure 1a, a hand-drawn illustration displays the genealogy of the last Byzantine emperor drawn as a collection of trees. This visualization has a strong spatial organization based on family lines, roles, and generational hierarchy. In fact, tree structures can be found in multiple historical representations of networks because they mirror the conception of lineage as a branching linear connected structure. In Figure 1b, we see a contemporary representation of a historical network<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> , this time depicting the list of signatories of a marriage contract in Angoulême, France in the 18th century, as well as their extended social networks <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. This network, developed using Gephi shows the global social structure of this historical community, produced using a force-directed layout, such that highly connected subgroups attract each other, thereby revealing the cliques and subcommunities within the dataset.</p>
<p>To describe them formally, hierarchical trees (such as Figure 1a) are a sub-category of networks that are acyclic (i.e. there are no loop encountered during a traversal of the tree) and directed (i.e. the relationships described by the edges are one-directional, rather than reciprocal). The hierarchical aspect signifies a certain categorization of the nodes so that those placed on the same level hold a similar value or meaning. Hierarchical trees are a spatial organization whose traces date back to antiquity, and which can be found in a variety of knowledge domains. As described by Drucker in her book Graphesis <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, trees are interesting because their spatial organization carries meaning. In the case of social networks, this spatial organization becomes an indicator of multiple elements including birth order, generational breadth and span, patterns of marriage <sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Another interesting aspect to hierarchical trees is their embedded story-telling. The root node(s), typically placed at the top<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>  of the hierarchy, creates a visual anchor that drives the reader in, and directs their attention down the edges in a manner which is almost a narrative approach to visualization.</p>
<p>On the other hand, force-directed networks (Figure 1b) are mathematical products, where physical simulations ran multiple times on a dataset model attraction and repulsion between nodes, therefore automatically placing nodes with high connectivity close to one another, or at the opposite, resulting in disconnected nodes being placed far from each other, highlighting their disconnect. For Ahnert et al., force-directed networks reject hierarchies, which become hidden and difficult to notice, even if they were strongly present within the dataset <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Modern readings have argued for the advantages of force-directed networks by justly questioning the relevance and accuracy of representing the world in rigidly structured hierarchical roles. In actual historical communities, influence does not necessarily traverse time and generations in a clear-cut linear way. Similarly, trees of knowledge fall short when representing complex webs of information, as the distributed aspect of the web and social networks have clearly illustrated in the past decades<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> .</p>
<p>In the context of humanistic research, however, the intentional organization of network data has an undeniable value, when compared to the visual organization that results of mathematical algorithms. Drucker explains it clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spatial distribution of network diagrams, topic maps, and other graphical expressions of processed text or intellectual content is often determined by the exigencies of screen real estate, rather than by a semantic value inherent in the visualization. This introduces incidental artifacts of visual information. A point in a graph may be far from another because of a parameter in the program that governs display, rather than on account of the weight accorded to the information in the data set. The argument of the graphic may even be counter to the argument of the information, creating an interpretative warp or skew, so that what we see and read is actually a reification of misinformation.<br>
<sup id="fnref2:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><br>
In that way, network visualizations are no different than other visualizations of data, as they themselves can reproduce existing biases, and cement them as neutral knowledge. Porras asks us to keep our eyes open to the dangers of network visualizations as they can  “reinscribe historic and contemporary power differentials”   <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In visualization literature, a growing voice argues for the consideration of semantics and connotation in the visualization design, especially within humanistic scholarship. In previous work <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>, we report how humanists have consistently commented on the connotative dryness of visualization tools, linking it to a reduction of rich research material <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. Through user research, we found that humanist scholars felt a semantic distance between their experience of their research material and practice and its representation in visualization tools. Such tools can end up stripping data of essential meaning-making elements such as temporality, physicality, and terminology. More specifically, we identified structure in conceptualizations and ontologies as one of the characteristics of humanistic research that is often missing in visualizations. We also found proof that meaning, intentionally layered into visualization, had the potential to reduce the semantic distance experienced by scholars, and alleviate their discomfort. In this context, the question of representing data’s hierarchical structures within historical social networks is an interrogation of our Layers of Meaning (LoM) framework, and an investigation of a larger trend in digital humanities scholarship during the data era.</p>
<h2 id="research-questions">Research Questions</h2>
<p>To build on the previous discussion, we wanted to investigate the effects that hierarchical trees and force-directed graphs have on user perception. Because the literature on mental models in visualization shows link effects on efficiency and user experience, we developed an extensive user evaluation protocol where we compare the two representations and investigate the perceptual impacts of each one. In the next section, we describe the process we followed, and the findings we can extract from it.</p>
<p>Through this process, we aimed to answer the following research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>RQ1: Do users have an inherent mental model of social network spatial organizations? How is it visually structured?</li>
<li>RQ2: How does representing historical social network data using a generational hierarchy affect cognitive load during social networks analysis tasks?</li>
<li>RQ3: How does hierarchy within social network data affect insight-building and recall?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to perform a fair comparison, we developed two visualizations showing both hierarchical and standard force-directed visualizations of historical social networks. We developed a prototype for hierarchical tree layout visualization using the Javascript visualization library D3. We chose to develop this algorithm on top of the existing force-directed layout algorithms for multiple reasons. First, the existing force-directed layout algorithms are currently mature and deliver high-quality performance. Perhaps as a consequence, these layouts are supported by major graph drawing libraries and toolkits, which opens future possibilities for wider implementation of hierarchical graph layouts. Force-directed layouts also include parameters to reduce node collision, occlusion, and bring in useful results, such as bringing together highly connected clusters, which, while we do not want it to break inherent hierarchy in the data, still proves to be useful in reducing edge-crossing.</p>
<p>We designed and implemented an algorithm that traverses a force-directed graph and spatially organizes it based on a user-defined parameter. The full algorithm description and code can be found on our <a href="github.com/HLMQA/egoNahr">GitHub page</a>. Figure 2 shows the same dataset represented as both a force-directed graph (left), and a hierarchical network (right). We call the graphs produced by our hierarchical layout force-layered graphs. This porte-manteau hints at the underlying force-directed layout, and includes the layered aspect of hierarchical graphs (alternatively referred to as layered graphs, or Sugiyama-graphs).</p>

<h2 id="study">Study</h2>
<p>In this section, we describe the evaluation protocol used to answer the RQs described in section 3. In HCI, user evaluations are a standard way to get feedback and to get better insight into users’ needs. It is also a common way to evaluate usability and identify obstacles to adoption of digital tools. Since usability and adoption are a recurrent issue in DH research, there is real value to be gained from applying such methods to pinpoint exact usability issues in collaboration with the intended audience. In this section, we describe each step of the methodology together with the results found. For each subsection, the full table of results can be found in the annex. In this section, we sometimes use the notations F-D and F-L as shorthand for Force-Directed or Force-Layered graphs respectively.</p>
<p>Participants. We recruited 15 participants (12 women, 3 men) with background in Art History and Digital Humanities, most of them graduate students in the university’s Digital Humanities MSc program. Participants had on average 3.6 years of experience in their domain, and 1.2 years of experience using digital tools to support their research or study practice. Among participants, most digital tool usage within field of study consisted of digital archives (11 out of 15), spreadsheets (10 out of 15), and graph visualization tools (9 out of 15).</p>
<p>Data. We used data extracted from the Cornelia<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>  database, which uses archival documents to gather historical data on 17th century artistic communities<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> . We selected a subset containing 38 persons related through ancestry, marriage and godparenthood links. This dataset specifically highlights (extra)familial hierarchy structure.</p>
<p>Graphs. Figure 3 shows the two network visualization used in this study. We used the same dataset for both graphs not to introduce bias. However, to minimize learning effects, we manually changed the names so that the similarity of the two networks would not be obvious.</p>

<h2 id="mental-model-elicitation">Mental model elicitation</h2>
<p>Understanding users&rsquo; existing mental models (i.e. the representation they internally make of specific information structures or processes) is key if we aim to support similar structures in building visualizations. Previous work in the HCI field has demonstrated the value of asking participants to draw their mental models as a way to externalize them <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Before showing participants the graphs, we first started by asking each one to freely draw a social structure of their choosing, in order to elicit their mental mapping of social structures. They were invited to sketch out any fictional or existing social structure network (from stories, movies or books, or their own personal life<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> ). They were encouraged to consider lineage relationships, but also non-blood ties such as extended families, and close friends. We then extracted the recurring themes present in the produced sketches. A few of these sketches can be seen in Figure 4.</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We found that in all<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>  cases, participants sketched graphs had a hierarchical structure. These representations were mainly tree structures, with many of them structured as layered graphs. We also found that most participants used the vertical axis as a single indicator of generational division. However, in some cases, this pattern was broken as different relationships (edges towards friends for instance) were represented as orthogonal to the family links (Figure 4, P15). Indeed, almost a third (35%) of participants chose to represent multiple relationship types within the graphs.</p>
<p>Familiar structure, or expression of an internal mental model? While we can use the results from this elicitation task to induce the existence of a ‘natural’ hierarchical mental model of such data for the users, the exposure to family-tree type representations is an equally likely explanation for the phenomenon. Family trees are an old form of representations that are commonly seen by the public [Mitchell, 2014]. They are also commonly used in (art) historical teaching, which makes our participants even more likely to have built familiarity towards them. In reality, our participants have likely interacted with similar representations in the past, and may have defaulted to recreating a similar structure. We consider that these results do inform us of the internal model within the participants, itself caused by either inherent hierarchization of this data, or unvoluntary training caused by previous exposure.</p>
<h2 id="think-aloud-study">Think aloud study</h2>
<p>We asked participants to explore the dataset in each condition while vocalizing their thought process. Similar to the mental model elicitation approach, this method allows to make the thought process of participants explicit. We then captured and transcribed participants think-aloud process and analyzed it using a thematic analysis to uncover patterns of insight<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>  and identify differences between the force-directed and the force-layered conditions.</p>
<p>We found that the force-layered visualization triggered more interpretative<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>  and reflective insights. We also find more occurrences of intrigue or curiosity about the portrayed social structures ( _  It&rsquo;s too bad you can&rsquo;t see more about the person, you can&rsquo;t tell for example what their profession is,    I don&rsquo;t know the person, but I imagine if I were researching these people, it can be really interesting to see _ ). Some participants also found contradictions in the underlying data, and offered hypotheses to explain those, or simply pointed them out ([This person] _ has an offspring but it&rsquo;s somehow not an event for _ [their wife] _ — it&rsquo;s not an event for her, although it is with her&quot;_ ). Finally, we found a clear divide in the number of negative emotions such as overwhelmingness or defeat in the condition of force-directed network usage ( _ There are a lot of persons, and here a lot of events.

<p>To complement the open nature of the think-aloud exploration, we conducted a more structured exploration task where we asked participants to answer specific questions about the social dynamics portrayed in the visualization. We designed these questions based on the existing literature on graph exploration tasks<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>  and categorized them into easy questions (e.g.  <em>find the most connected actor</em> ,  <em>Find all people who knew both X and Y</em> ) and difficult questions ( <em>How does the graph evolve between birth of person X and their death</em> ,  _ Describe the network at a specific year _ ).</p>
<p>We assessed the answers to the exploration tasks based on complete and partial correctness. We found that for easy questions, a similar number of participants (F-D: n=11; F-L: n=10) gave correct answers with both conditions. However, in the force-directed condition, half of these answers were incomplete. To the difficult questions, more participants gave correct answers using the force-layered condition (n=6). Notably, however, none of the participants were able to answer the same questions using the force-directed condition completely and correctly. The number of participants who gave incomplete answers was the same for both conditions.</p>
<h2 id="perception-task">Perception Task</h2>
<p>In order to measure how the perception of the graphs compared with their actual characteristics, we collected participants recollection of some quantitative graph characteristics such as network size, and number of generations. We also asked about the perceived complexity of the social structure. Both networks contained the same number of nodes thirty-eight nodes. We found that participants perceived the force-layered graph to contain  <em>fewer</em>  nodes (median=30) than was the case. They were more slightly accurate when using the force-directed graph (median=35).</p>
<p>Finally, a majority of participants reported feeling that the social structure displayed in the force-layered condition was of a simpler nature one than the force-directed. This corroborates the difference in perceived graph size, as participants perceived networks in the force-layered condition to have fewer nodes.</p>
<h2 id="recall-task">Recall task</h2>
<p>To assess recall, we aimed to see how well participants remembered the graph in its entirety. We then asked them to draw the graph to their best recollection after having diverted their attention for a brief moment<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> . We then analyzed the resulting sketch based on categories including the restitution of meaningful sub-communities, node-link structure, and visual detail.</p>
<p>We found differences in specific metrics between the recall sketches of the two versions, specifically on the identification of bridge nodes, as well as the retention of the multiple types of relationships. In the force-directed recall sketches, participants have retained the “dog-bone” structure of the graph consisting of two large clusters representing the two main families and tied together through a bridge node. Most participants also retained - at least partially - the lower antennas formed by the two loosely connected pairs nodes. In the force-layered condition, the drawings have retained the left-to-right organization of the nodes, as well as the two distinct subgraphs representing the two families. The bridge node bringing these two groups together was not systematically included. Finally, participants retained the existence of multiple types of relationships better in the force-layered condition, as they recalled more of the godparent type links. Example drawings from participants for each condition can be seen in Figure 5.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-load">Cognitive load</h2>
<p>While evaluating performance can provide a good understanding of efficiency achieved using a system, the mental effort required is not answered by these approaches. We therefore measure participants&rsquo; cognitive load<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>  when using the two conditions.</p>
<p>As a measure for cognitive load, we used a raw NASA-TLX questionnaire [Hart, 1998] The NASA-TLX questionnaire is a widely used metric for measuring cognitive load in the HCI field. It consists of a self-reported scale capturing workload across six dimensions: Mental, Physical, and Temporal Demands, Frustration, Effort, and Performance [Hart, 1998]. Participants are asked to score each of these variables on a 0 — 100 scale where a lower value represents a lower demand<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> .</p>
<p>Comparing the raw NASA-TLX scores, we find that the force-layered visualization (average score of 26.3) was found to be less demanding than the force-directed graph (average score of 35.78), the metrics with most variance between conditions being mental demand, effort, and frustration (see Figure 6).</p>

<h2 id="user-preference">User preference</h2>
<p>Finally, we performed a preference-based ranking. Participants were asked to subjectively rank the force-directed and the force-layered graphs on a Likert scale on aspects such as perceived suitability to task and data, or visual appeal.</p>
<p>Figure 7 shows the average results of the preference rankings for each category. Globally, participants ranked the force-layered condition higher than the force-directed condition in suitability to both data and tasks. They indicated that the force-layered condition needed less effort to understand than the standard one, and that they had higher confidence in their answers. Finally, the force-layered graphs also scored higher in visual appeal, and overall preference.</p>

<h2 id="results--discussion">Results &amp; Discussion</h2>
<p>Based on a task of mental model elicitation, we found that participants overwhelmingly relied on generational hierarchical structure to draw familial social networks. This can be either because of inherent structure perceived in the data, or association of this type of dataset with traditional ancestry tree representations.</p>
<p>When exploring two different versions of a social network where one is layered hierarchically and the other one isn’t, we found that participants expressed more – and deeper – insights in the case of the force-layered visualization. They also engaged more critically with the dataset, for instance by pointing out inconsistencies. The force-directed version, however, drew more comments and descriptions about the visualization features, suggesting that participants engaged more with the  <em>visualization</em>  in the force-directed condition, and with the  <em>data</em>  in the force-layered condition. We also found that the force-layered representation elicited more positive emotions such as curiosity and expressions of enjoyment or interest, that were not as frequent using the force-directed version. Moreover, our results reveal that users perceived the social structure shown in force-layered graphs to be smaller, and less complex than similar structure visualized through a force-directed layout. However, they were more accurate in size estimation using the force-directed layout.</p>
<p>Concerning recall, we found that participants retained more of the significant clusters with the force-layered condition, although they retained more of the bridge nodes after using the force-directed version. In both cases, the bridge nodes were placed in the center of the visualization, so saliency does not explain the difference in these results. We suggest that can be caused by the topology of each graph. In the force-layered version, the ties among each family create two horizontal substructures that become the major ground of the visual, while the dog-bone structure in the force-directed layout represent the major part of the ground figure, and the bridge node is an essential part to its structure. Finally, using a raw NASA-TLX questionnaire and a preference ranking, we found that participants found the force-layered visualization less demanding cognitively. They also judged it to be more suited to the tasks and data, and more visually appealing.</p>
<p>As we analyze these findings in conversation with the literature on visualization in humanistic research, we identify emerging discussion points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Engagement with data &amp; engagement with visualization. In the think-aloud study results, we describe how hierarchical trees seemingly elicit an engagement with the  <em>data</em> , while force-directed layouts trigger comments about the features and characteristics of the  <em>tool</em>  itself. This subtle distinction has relevant implications, as it suggests that the spatial organization of the network affects the perception of the data representation. Visualized data can therefore be integrated in users’ mental models in a way that allows them to analyze and question it; or it can be obscured by the layer of foreign conceptualization that does not allow it to blend with their existing knowledge. As it is, it is critical to encourage representations that allow a connection with the research material itself, and where the visualization features themselves do not become the center of attention for users. We also see this finding as a validating step of the guidelines developed in the Layers of Meaning framework <sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. In this case, by layering meaning through the structure of network graphs, we find that there is an effect to the level of engagement users have with research data. What seems to be a slight visual difference appears to affect the very focus of users’ attention, which in turn reveals the critical aspect of connotative elements and intentional design choices in visualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Force-directed network structure as artifact. In the analysis of the recall of social structure information, we note that more participants recalled the existence of a bridge node between the two clusters with the force-directed network. We suggest that this is due to the singular topology of the generated network. In truth, what is a particular visual characteristic of a network topology (a bridge node between two tight clusters) is an abstraction of a significant piece of information in the dataset (a common person bringing together two large families). In a way, the fact that the force-directed layout created this artificial shape helped highlight a very important information in the data, which has been better remembered by participants. From this perspective, we can thus defend that force-directed layouts also  <em>create</em>  meaning through the specific topologies they generate. These shapes are often singular, or unique, because they are not a product of intentional design. Rather, then come as the result of computations unique to the dataset, the canvas space and the set parameters. We therefore defend the concept of a force-directed network organization as an artifact in itself. One that holds the potential to carry meaning; to be recognized, analyzed, and categorized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defending the importance of challenging mental models. We argue throughout this article that one of the strengths of hierarchical tree structures is that they reproduce existing mental models, therefore making it easier to read and grasp information they represent as it fits within scholars’ existing knowledge. However, existing models of knowledge are not necessarily correct, accurate, or good to perpetuate. For instance, conventional family trees carry a variety of assumptions about social structures that make them both limited and limiting when representing real-life data. Worse, these representations, when uncritically absorbed, function as prescriptive principles of how communities should exist in society. There is therefore an undeniable larger implication in the discussion about how social network data should be represented. The improved understanding, preference and lower effort that hierarchical trees bring needs to be balanced – or perhaps complemented - by the novel perspectives that force-directed layouts create.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implications--future-work">Implications &amp; Future work</h2>
<p>More research is needed to assess the effect of other types of structure in network visualizations. Once these effects are clearly understood, it would be interesting to evaluate how novel graph layout such as our FL algorithm can be introduced to existing visualization packages. It would also be interesting to make them customizable to specific needs outside of family and generational structures. Indeed, an important implication of this work is that any singular off-the-shelf technique cannot be sufficient for a solid support of DAH research. Rather than promote the use of a specific visualization technique over another, we advocate for researchers access to a variety of representation techniques that can accompany different tasks, data types, and expertise levels.</p>
<p>Finally, the generalizability of our discussion to other humanistic fields is an additional avenue for future research. Since this study was mainly focused on an art historical research, our initial results cannot be readily extrapolated to different domains. However, similar challenges of historical social networks exist for humanist researchers across disciplines. Future research is needed to evaluate how hierarchy in historical social network visualizations affects different research fields depending on their unique needs and constraints.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we explored the perceptual effect of hierarchy in visualizations of historical social networks. We have found, based on a user-centered approach, that humanist participants had a hierarchical mental model of social networks, indicating that there could be advantages to representing social networks in a similarly hierarchical structure. Our study confirmed this hypothesis, as we found that users reported lower cognitive load, more frequent and deeper insights, as well as a significant preference for the hierarchical representations. Despite these results, we nuance these findings by calling attention to the fact that force-directed graphs can carry meaning in their generated topology, allow users to make conclusions on tightness of networks, clusters, and question the accepted dogmas in terms of community structure. However, because social networks are so critical to certain humanistic research domains, the perceptual benefits to hierarchically structured layouts should not be overlooked. As graph-drawing software is often the most accessible way for researchers to gather quick visual overview, we suggest that these layouts should be more commonly supported as alternatives to allow scholars to have multiple perspectives on their data.</p>
<p>By these findings, we hope to contribute to the necessary critical discussion nuancing the role of network visualization in humanistic research. In the future, we would like to broaden the scope of this study by investigating the effects of hierarchy for other types of historical (social) networks<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> . We believe such an interdisciplinary line of research has the potential to trigger novel questions – for instance about the impact of structure in network visualization of historical data, and the perceptual effects of commonly used design patterns. Only by questioning what we assume to be effective can we (re)design visualization tools that blend in with scholars’ experience of their material and practice, and ultimately strengthen the value of visualization as a research tool for humanists.</p>

<p>The term intertext is used to name a passage of text that gives evidence of one author using another author’s words. Scholarly consensus indicates that intertexts exist (<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> for Latin literature, see <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> for Greek literature, see <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>). While there is great variation in the motivation for the use of an intertext, perhaps the reuse signals an author’s erudition or enhances the effect of an expression. For example, when Vergil in his epic  <em>Aeneid</em>  describes the sound of a horse galloping across the fields:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>quadrupedante putrem  <strong>sonitu quatit ungula</strong>  campum (Aeneid 8.596).</p>
<p>The horses’ hooves shake the soft-soiled plain with four-footed thunder.</p>
<p>He is adapting a line from his epic predecessor Ennius:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>. . . summo  <strong>sonitu quatit ungula</strong>  terram. (Ennius Annals 8.264)</p>
<p>The horses’ hooves shake the earth with great thunder.</p>
<p>With this recollection, Vergil is reusing available poetic materials, demonstrating familiarity with his predecessor Ennius, and inviting the reader to compare the parallel passages.</p>
<p>Various attempts have been made at computer-assisted intertext discovery (<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>)<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> , but none have made a conscious effort to standardize machine-accessibility of the intertext discovery process and results. This paper presents the Tesserae Intertext Service Application Programming Interface (TIS-API), which specifies the rules of machine-accessibility for the intertext discovery tool known as Tesserae.</p>
<p>We argue that machine-accessibility to Tesserae’s capabilities, as provided by the TIS-API, is an enhancement to the existing Tesserae software. We first demonstrate that the TIS-API does, in fact, make Tesserae’s capabilities machine-accessible by showing how the TIS-API is designed on standard principles in the web development community, and by walking through an example of how the TIS-API can be used to conduct a Tesserae search in a machine-accessible way. Two case studies further explore how the TIS-API enhances the Tesserae software. The first case study demonstrates how the TIS-API aids collaboration among members of the Tesserae project team, particularly in the implementation of the new Tesserae website interface. The second case study demonstrates how someone outside of the Tesserae project team sees value in the TIS-API for making the software easier to integrate into research workflows that aid reproducibility in literary criticism research.</p>
<h2 id="tesserae">Tesserae</h2>
<p>The Tesserae Project develops software for discovering intertexts, with particular focus on the intertexts that appear in ancient Greek and Latin literature <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. The project’s main tool, called Tesserae (<a href="https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/">https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/</a>), accomplishes this by analyzing and comparing two texts for regions of word reuse.</p>
<p>For example, in order to find intertexts between Vergil’s  <em>Aeneid</em>  and Lucan’s Bellum Civile, Tesserae goes through both works line-by-line to find where pairs of words occur in lines from both works. Because the  <em>Aeneid</em>  precedes the Bellum Civile in publication, we can assume that the <em>Aeneid</em> served as a source text from which the later poet could draw upon for poetic raw material. Accordingly, the results from this Tesserae search can help us find places where Lucan may have borrowed words from Vergil (see <sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> for examples).</p>
<p>Given the highly inflected nature of both ancient Greek and Latin, Tesserae also allows for matching by stem. This allows for finding examples of Lucan reusing Vergil’s words in different grammatical and morphological forms. It is also useful to exclude common words, that is stopwords, from Tesserae searches, on the grounds that the reuse of common words signals not so much Vergil’s influence on Lucan as much as the common language available to the poets in composing their respective works. In summary, when Tesserae is given (1) two texts to compare, (2) a manner in which to compare the words of the texts (i.e., by exact word match or by stem), and (3) a list of stopwords to ignore, instances of text reuse can be found, which in turn can serve as evidence of intertexts.</p>
<p>Originally conceived of as a command line tool, the advent of the Tesserae website interface in 2009 (<a href="https://tesseraev3.caset.buffalo.edu/">https://tesseraev3.caset.buffalo.edu/</a>) made the delivery of its intertext discovery capabilities much more human-accessible <sup id="fnref2:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. However, this same interface made machine-accessibility difficult for two main reasons. First, the submission of Tesserae searches relied on user input via web forms. Second, the results of the Tesserae searches were returned as an HTML webpage. While these two reasons did not make the Tesserae results impossible to access automatically, they did present difficulties with the automatic submission of search queries and the parsing of results because there were no guarantees that the input forms or the results webpage would remain unchanged. Any tools built on the Tesserae site looking and performing in exactly one way would most likely fail in the face of website updates that changed the input forms or the layout of the search results. The lack of a machine-accessible design created a situation in which Tesserae could be difficult to integrate with other digital projects, short of installing and hosting a standalone instance of Tesserae.</p>
<p>The TIS-API eases the burden of integrating Tesserae’s intertext discovery capabilities into other projects by permitting queries to Tesserae’s database of texts, submission of Tesserae search requests, and retrieval of search results — all in a machine-accessible way. The TIS-API was designed, developed, and deployed at the SUNY University at Buffalo, in collaboration with developers at the University of Notre Dame, where backend libraries on which the TIS-API relies were developed. The University of Notre Dame also developed a web frontend powered by the TIS-API, demonstrating one instance in which the TIS-API eased the burden of integrating Tesserae’s intertext discovery capabilities into new software. As an important perspective from outside of the Tesserae Project, a researcher at the Quantitative Criticism Lab (University of Texas at Austin) has tested and commented on the TIS-API.</p>
<h2 id="tis-api-design">TIS-API Design</h2>
<p>Following standard practice for machine-accessible communication across the Internet, the TIS-API was designed according to the five REpresentational State Transfer (REST) principles <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>, <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Since the basic rules for communication over the Internet are already defined by the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the five REST principles provide further guidelines on how to use HTTP for effective machine-to-machine communication.</p>
<p>The fundamental assumption of the five REST principles is that the only thing a machine can request from another machine is a resource (Figure 1).</p>

        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the original vision of the five REST principles, a resource typically took the form of a webpage or some multimedia asset, like an image. For Tesserae’s intertextual discoveries, one resource would be the discoveries themselves — the results from a Tesserae search. Other resources, such as text information and search options, aid in the production of those discoveries.</p>
<p>Starting from these basic assumptions about resources, the first REST principle is to have a name for every resource (Figure 2).</p>

     class="portrait"
     ><figcaption>
        <p>First REST principle: every resource that a server makes available must have a name. One resource that the TIS-API makes available is the catalog of texts that Tesserae has access to, which can be accessed by the name /texts/. Furthermore, metadata for each text in the catalog can also be requested. Therefore, the TIS-API assigns a name to each resource. In the example figure, the name “0” is associated with <em>Aeneid</em> , the name 1 is associated with <em>Bellum Civile</em> , and so forth. Note that these example names are not the ones used in the actual deployment currently running through the Tesserae project.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This allows one machine to make a request on a specific resource from another machine. For example, the name <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/">http://www.buffalo.edu/</a> refers to the resource that is the main web page for the University at Buffalo. The TIS-API specifies naming conventions for the resources necessary to carry out Tesserae searches. For example, the naming conventions require that /texts/ be part of the name for resources referring to texts available in a Tesserae database. More examples of names and the TIS-API naming conventions will be shown later in the paper.</p>
<p>The second REST principle is that the way one specific request behaves for one resource is similar to the behavior of the same request on a different resource (Figure 3).</p>

     class="landscape"
     ><figcaption>
        <p>Second REST principle: requests should behave similarly across resources. In this example, the client has requested a resource named /texts/a. In response, the server provides information on a. When the client requests for a resource named /texts/b, the server responds in a similar fashion, except that it provides information on b instead of on a.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Within the rules of HTTP, there are various requests that can be made. One common request is GET, which requests retrieval of the resource. Going back to the University at Buffalo main web page example, a computer requesting a GET for <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/">http://www.buffalo.edu/</a> is asking another computer to retrieve the University at Buffalo main webpage. The TIS-API specifies that requesting a GET for <webhost>/texts/ (where <webhost> is replaced with the URL referring to a server on which the TIS-API is installed) will retrieve information about the texts available in a Tesserae database.</p>
<p>The third REST principle is that modification of a resource is mediated through instructions, which are called representations (Figure 4).</p>

     class="landscape"
     ><figcaption>
        <p>Third REST principle: modifications to a resource are mediated through instructions, known as a representation. When a client requests that a Tesserae search be run, the TIS-API modifies the parallels resource by appending newly found intertexts. What intertexts should be added to “parallels” is determined by the representation that the client sent (shown as the blue icon), which contains instructions specifying how the search is to be run.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the TIS-API, this principle is highlighted particularly in the way Tesserae searches are submitted. To submit a Tesserae search, a machine must request a POST (like GET, POST is one of the requests that can be made through HTTP) on the <webhost>/parallels/ resource and provide Tesserae search options in a particular format. The particularly formatted search options would be a representation to which the third REST principle refers.</p>
<p>The fourth REST principle is that representations are self-descriptive. Admittedly, the TIS-API does not conform to this principle directly. However, one way in which the TIS-API adheres to the spirit of this principle is in the search results resource. Search results resources are defined to contain the search options used to produce the results available in the resource. In this way, it would be possible to know exactly what options produced these results (Figure 5). This also enables caching of results, which can lead to a better user experience in the form of reduced search times.</p>

     class="landscape"
     ><figcaption>
        <p>Fourth REST principle: representations should be self-descriptive. Although the TIS-API is not strict in following this principle, one way in which it practices the spirit of this principle is in the server response to a request for search results. The representation used in submitting the current search (shown as the blue icon) is given as part of the server’s response.
        </p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The fifth and final REST principle is that application state information should not be stored; instead, it should be passed as a representation. To unpack the meaning of this, it is important to consider another assumption about the REST principles: when one computer communicates with another computer, the two are in a server-client relationship. The server is the computer that holds the resource that a client wishes to make a request on. As a result, the client always initiates contact with the server. Application state refers to a step in some process that the server and client navigate together.</p>
<p>A common server-client application is online shopping. The first step is for the client to submit a set of items to purchase; then, the server needs to calculate various things (like whether the items are in stock, how much the order will cost, taxes to collect, and other business-related tasks); then, the client needs to provide authorization to pay for the purchase; finally, the server should notify the client that the order has been placed and that the purchase has been billed. According to the fifth REST principle, neither the client nor the server should store information specifying which step they are on. Rather, the exchange of information they conduct as part of that process should specify which step they are on.</p>
<p>The TIS-API exhibits compliance with the fifth REST principle in the way it handles Tesserae search submissions (Figure 6).</p>

     class="landscape"
     ><figcaption>
        <p>Fifth REST principle: application state should not be stored in the API. In the example of running a Tesserae search, the application is expected to 1) run a search as specified and 2) display the results. The TIS-API separates these two states of the application into individual requests, thereby avoiding the need to store application state either on the client or the server. Instead, the application state is mediated by representation: the client knows how to request search results based on information the server has given (shown as the red icon). Note that the client is not required to immediately request search results; because it is not tied to an application state, it can make other requests, such as requests for certain texts or for a new stopwords list, before requesting the search results.

<p>For the Tesserae search application, the client first submits a Tesserae search; the server then needs to run the search and store the results; finally, the client should be able to access the results. Since Tesserae search may take longer than a user is willing to wait, it seemed important to design the search application in such a way that the client would not be stuck waiting for the server to respond with search results. Designing the application so that the server would first respond to the client with the resource name for completed search results not only freed the client from waiting on the server but also made storing application state in either the server or the client unnecessary. The client can make a request on the completed search results, and if the server responds that they aren’t ready yet, the client can wait to make a request later.</p>
<p>The previous points demonstrate that each of the five REST principles were considered in certain aspects of the TIS-API. While these examples do not describe all the ways in which the five REST principles were employed in the design of the TIS-API, these examples should serve to substantiate the claim that the five REST principles were important considerations during the design of the TIS-API. Because of this, the TIS-API provides machine-accessibility to Tesserae’s capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="tesserae-search-via-the-tis-api">Tesserae Search via the TIS-API</h2>
<p>Though claims of machine-accessibility can be made through the REST principles, it can be more convincing to show machine-accessibility by walking through the process of submitting a Tesserae search through the TIS-API (see Figure 7 for a high-level workflow of the process).

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-tesserae-search-query">Anatomy of a Tesserae Search Query</h2>
<p>To start the discussion of how the TIS-API can be used to perform a Tesserae search, the component parts of a Tesserae search query should be reviewed. Although the details for the Tesserae search process have already been described <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>, the focus here is to have a simplified but strong conceptual grasp on the parts involved in a Tesserae search. By understanding what the building blocks are for defining a search, it will be easier to understand how each of these blocks are addressed by the TIS-API. The aspects of the Tesserae search input discussed in this paper are:</p>
<ul>
<li>source text</li>
<li>target text</li>
<li>type of feature used to find matches</li>
<li>stopwords</li>
</ul>
<p>To frame the discussion of these inputs, it will be helpful to state what the Tesserae search is supposed to do: the objective of Tesserae search is to find intertexts between two works. Thinking of Tesserae search in this way, it becomes immediately obvious that two works need to be specified in the input. Because Tesserae was originally developed as a tool for intertext detection, a relationship between the two works is assumed: namely, that one work influenced the other. For this reason, a Tesserae search query is formulated in terms of a source text (i.e., the work that influences the other) and a target text (i.e., the work that was influenced by the other).</p>
<p>Another aspect fundamental to specifying a Tesserae search query is defining what counts as an intertext. For purposes of the Tesserae search algorithm, an intertext is defined by the matching of at least two features between two passages, where one passage comes from the source text, and the other passage comes from the target text. Thus, it becomes necessary to specify which type of feature to compare when looking for matching features.</p>
<p>One feature type is the lemma type, which can be thought of as a dictionary headword. When looking up the definition of a given word in the dictionary, it is sometimes necessary to change the spelling of the word to find the correct entry. For example, the definition for the word love in I love to swim is found in the dictionary under the lemma love. In this example, no spelling change is necessary to find the lemma. However, the definition for the word loves from He loves swimming is also found under the lemma love. It is necessary to remove the final s from loves in order to find the lemma.</p>
<p>If lemmata (the plural of lemma) are used to search for intertexts, only passages that share at least two different lemmata will be considered a potential intertext. For example, suppose we have the following passages (again):</p>
<p>I love to swim  He loves swimming</p>
<p>Note that passage 1 contains the words love and swim, both of which also look identical to their lemmata. Passage 2 likewise contains the lemmata love (from loves) and swim (from swimming). From this information, it can be seen that a Tesserae search searching for intertexts based on the lemma feature would find that these two passages are a potential intertext.</p>
<p>A final aspect to consider in this simplified conception of the inputs to a Tesserae search is the matter of stopwords. Often, there are features we believe will be unimportant in determining whether one passage refers to another. For example, we may find common words like articles and prepositions to be irrelevant. In this case, we would like a Tesserae search to ignore passages that match only because of articles and prepositions. To specify features that we think are not interesting, we can use a stopwords list to prevent those features from being counted when determining whether two passages are a potential intertext.</p>
<p>Knowing now that a source text, a target text, a feature definition, and a stopwords list are important options to specify in a Tesserae search, it is clear that these options will need to be specified to the TIS-API when submitting a Tesserae search query.</p>
<h2 id="api-concepts">API Concepts</h2>
<p>Before discussing how to use the TIS-API to perform Tesserae search, some terminology and conventions should be noted. First, the meaning of TIS-API should be more carefully stated. The TIS-API, in its strictest sense, is a set of rules that defines server behavior in response to client requests. An implementation of the TIS-API, therefore, is code that, when run, behaves in accordance with the rules that were defined. When this code is running, we can say that a computer is  “running an instance of the TIS-API.”  Since the code allows a computer to follow the rules of the TIS-API and since the deployed software exhibits the behaviors defined by the rules of the TIS-API, the use of “TIS-API” can slip from its strict sense into a more inclusive (and therefore ambiguous) sense that may denote either the rules, the code, or the deployed software.</p>
<p>The angle brackets (&lt;,  &gt;) convention used in resource names should also be explained explicitly. Just as earlier in the paper, the angle brackets (&lt;,  &gt;) denote a placeholder; the word(s) within the angle brackets hint at what should replace this placeholder. For example, as seen earlier, <webhost>/texts/ specifies a name for interacting with text resources. However, the name does not literally contain <webhost>; rather, <webhost> should be replaced with an identifier to a running instance of the TIS-API. For example, if <a href="https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/api">https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/api</a> is the URL to a running instance of the TIS-API, <a href="https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/api/texts/">https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/api/texts/</a> (note that /texts/ has been added to the URL) is the name referring to the text resources available in that instance.</p>
<p>Finally, the term endpoint should be defined. Note that the initial part of the URL is largely irrelevant to the defined behavior for the TIS-API. In other words, whether <a href="https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/api">https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/api</a> or <a href="https://www.tis-api.com">https://www.tis-api.com</a> is used to work with texts, the TIS-API will respond in a similar manner — and it would behave exactly the same if both web hosts had the same text information in their respective databases. Therefore, the part of the name that distinguishes behavior is what comes after the web host’s identifier. These distinguishing patterns that come at the end of the URL are known as endpoints. By convention, these endpoints are referred to not by their full URL; rather, they are referred to by the portion of the URL that comes after the web host’s URL. For example, /texts/ is the TIS-API endpoint that deals with texts.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-tis-api-to-run-a-tesserae-search">Using the TIS-API to Run a Tesserae Search</h2>
<p>With a clear picture of Tesserae search options as well as the vocabulary used to express APIs, it is possible to consider how the TIS-API can be used to build and submit a Tesserae search query. The first endpoint to consider is /parallels/, which accepts Tesserae search requests. By performing a POST request on the /parallels/ endpoint and providing the Tesserae search options in a particular machine-readable format, a Tesserae search query can be submitted. Exact details on this particular machine-readable format can be found by consulting the documentation; for purposes of this paper, it is sufficient to know that the /parallels/ endpoint accepts Tesserae search query submissions.</p>
<p>Ignoring the specifics of the Tesserae search query submission format for the /parallels/ endpoint, earlier discussion has shown that a source text, a target text, a feature to search by, and a stopwords list must be specified. The TIS-API can be useful in choosing these options.</p>
<p>Since Tesserae can perform intertext discoveries only between texts already in its database, we can only reference a source text and a target text already in the Tesserae database when submitting a Tesserae search. How does the TIS-API provide access to information about texts in the Tesserae database? As mentioned earlier, text information can be obtained at the /texts/ endpoint. Again, there are specific details about the /texts/ endpoint that may be useful (such as querying the Tesserae database for texts written by a particular author) which can be found by consulting the documentation. But for purposes of this paper, it is sufficient to know that the /texts/ endpoint can be used to discover what texts are available to be used as a source or target text. From the information returned by performing a GET request on the /texts/ endpoint, identification codes used by the database to refer to specific texts can be obtained. These identifiers can specify a source and a target text in the information submitted in a POST to /parallels/.</p>
<p>Although the TIS-API does not specify a convenient endpoint for determining which search features can be specified, the documentation does specify valid options. Furthermore, the TIS-API defines that when an invalid option is given, the response will include information indicating invalidity of the request.</p>
<p>The TIS-API, however, does have a /stopwords/ endpoint that can be useful in choosing a stopwords list. Recall that stopwords lists are often composed of items that appear most frequently in the language. Given the appropriate information (as defined in the documentation), the /stopwords/ endpoint consults the Tesserae database and returns the most frequently appearing features (Figure 8).</p>

<p>In other words, the /stopwords/ endpoint can be used to collect the top N most frequently appearing features, where N is a number that can be specified. That list can be used as the stopwords list given to /parallels/ when submitting a Tesserae search query.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the TIS-API provides the /parallels/ endpoint for submitting a Tesserae search query, as well as the /texts/ and /stopwords/ endpoints to aid in choosing Tesserae search options. To retrieve search results, the TIS-API specifies the /parallels/<uuid>/ endpoint, where <uuid> is replaced by a search submission identifier (UUID is an acronym for Universally Unique IDentifier, which refers to a string of letters and numbers used to identify something). The identifier for a particular search can be found in the response data given by the /parallels/ endpoint on a successful query submission. In particular, a URL that ends in /parallels/<uuid>/ will be specified. In other words, a successful Tesserae search submission will provide the URL to retrieve the search results. Importantly, that URL is transmitted in a standard, machine-readable way.</p>
<p>For search queries that involve very small texts, going directly to the URL as soon as the response from /parallels/ comes back may permit retrieving the search results immediately. However, when longer texts are chosen, Tesserae search may take more time to complete. In that case, results would not immediately appear. Instead, requesting a GET at the result URL would yield a response indicating that the resource is not available. To ensure that the search has been submitted, the /parallels/<uuid>/status/ endpoint, which retrieves status information on the search submission (such as whether the search is in process or if it failed), could be used. When the status indicates that the search is complete, it would be possible to go to the results URL and find the search results.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-running-search-on-the-new-tesserae-website">Case Study: Running Search on the New Tesserae Website</h2>
<p>Having seen a theoretical use case for the TIS-API, it seems worthwhile to consider a practical use case for the TIS-API as well. To this end, we present the new Tesserae website, which is available at <a href="https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/">https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/</a> (Figure 9 shows what the website looks like at the time of writing when displaying results). This example demonstrates how the TIS-API, though designed for machine-accessibility, can still be used to simulate the traditional human-accessible experience that Tesserae has offered and that its user base in classics scholarship (of widely varying technical comfort) has become familiar with.</p>

<p>In order to perform a Tesserae search, the user first needs to choose source and target texts. The new website displays the source and target text options in dropdown menus, found in the top left part of the interface (see Figure 10). Behind the scenes, the website uses the “/texts/” endpoint to find what texts are available for comparison from the TIS-API. It then populates the dropdown lists with the information received from the “/texts/” endpoint. The user can then select source and target texts with these dropdown menus. In the example image (Figure [uiscreenshot]), the user has selected Vergil’s <em>Aeneid</em> as the source text and Lucan’s Bellum Civile as the target text.</p>

<p>To submit the Tesserae search for processing, the user simply hits the SEARCH button (see Figure 12). This action causes the website to submit the search parameters to the /parallels/ endpoint. Once the search is complete, the website automatically calls on the /parallels/<uuid>/ endpoint to retrieve the results of the search and displays those results on the main part of the interface (see Figure 13).</p>
<p>One tangential benefit of defining the new website’s functionality in terms of the TIS-API was development flexibility. Because the TIS-API defines expected behavior, the website developer could work on the website at the same time that the API developer was implementing the expected behavior. This allowed for important feedback informed by the website developer’s user experience. That feedback resulted in additional behaviors (e.g., paging of the search results, more detailed search status information) that improved the API and website together. As the two efforts came together for deployment of the new Tesserae website, the integration of the website with the TIS-API implementation required relatively little work (deployment itself, along with making sure that the user interface looked right, took most of the development time). This demonstrates the utility of the TIS-API internal to the Tesserae Project. Other digital humanities developers may want to consider this benefit when deciding whether they too can afford to improve their software’s ability to integrate with other software.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-harnessing-the-tis-api-for-research">Case Study: Harnessing the TIS-API for Research</h2>
<p>While the new Tesserae website demonstrates the advantages of the TIS-API for members of the Tesserae Project, it is also important to establish the advantages conferred to researchers not directly affiliated with the project. This section describes one such researcher’s experience with the TIS-API.</p>
<p>For writing his 2017 article  “Measuring and Mapping Intergeneric Allusion using Tesserae”  for a special issue of the Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities on Computer-Aided Processing of Intertextuality in Ancient Languages <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, one of the co-authors of this article found himself in the position of downloading the results of multiple Tesserae web searches in order to analyze not just an intertextual comparison of two authors, but rather an intertextual comparison of one author (the Latin epic poet Lucan) against several authors representative of a specific genre (the Latin love elegists Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid). The searches had to be conducted individually and care needed to be taken to ensure that each search used the same parameters, including stopword lists and cutoff scores, among other settings. Moreover, the author needed to be sure that this consistency in parameter selection could be maintained between sessions, with sometimes weeks or even months passing between searches. At the time, these factors were documented by the author in research notes, but from testing the TIS-API, it is clear how this process could have been improved had the new set-up been available: a similar paper written now could document the exact TIS-API calls for all of the author-to-author comparisons in a script with parameters specified upfront as constants.</p>
<p>This enhancement to the research process made possible through the TIS-API could be seen as a variation on software development’s DRY — don’t repeat yourself — principle <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. In programming, DRY argues for a reduction of duplicate code to increase writing efficiency, reduce opportunities for errors to be introduced, and decrease maintenance costs. The TIS-API allows for analogous benefits in a research context: searches can be formalized and then run and rerun without duplicative effort. To paraphrase Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas’s oft-cited definition of the DRY principle, the TIS-API makes it possible for every Tesserae search to  “have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation”   <sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> within a study.</p>
<p>Accordingly, code-based calls to the TIS-API should be considered now a best practice for researchers needing to aggregate the results of multiple Tesserae searches, as for example papers such as <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>. That said, even with respect to research making use of even a single Tesserae search, the ability to document the request in the form of an API request is valuable. This is because, no matter the number of searches, being able to document explicitly decisions made and actions taken in the course of gathering data plays an important role in making that research reproducible. In other words, code-based calls to the TIS-API improve researchers’ experience by making decisions explicitly documented at the time of data-gathering, rather than as an afterthought. It has been argued that researchers should aim for well-documented and reproducible workflows as part of a critical digital humanities <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>. It can also be argued that academic developers can support researchers in reaching this goal by making it easier to incorporate their software tools into research workflows. The TIS-API is a move in this direction.</p>
<p>One final point about using Tesserae searches in research workflows: at present, running, say, dozens or hundreds of Tesserae searches using the web form could be seen as a labor-intensive proposition, enough so as to be a disincentive to exploring research questions demanding this volume of web-form entry. Accessing the TIS-API through a script, on the other hand, greatly improves the researcher’s experience by reducing the labor of specifying Tesserae searches, which in turn reduces the risk of inconsistent querying and related errors that add more labor in data checking and correction or even having to rerun completed but unusable searches. With this in mind, one can imagine that availability of the TIS-API, by reducing the difficulty of collecting and collating multiple searches, will encourage more large-scale Tesserae-based studies.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<p>For all of the benefits made possible through the TIS-API, we recognize that the API could be improved. One improvement in particular we are considering is a way to document which version of the software produced a given set of results. This will be important as software development continues on Tesserae’s core functionality. While such development aims to improve Tesserae results, those improvements would come at the cost of reproducibility. It is possible that the development improvement would cause results obtained through one set of parameters on a given date to be different from the results obtained through the same set of parameters on a different date. By explicitly documenting which version of the Tesserae code produces a given set of results, reproducibility of results could be guaranteed while also permitting incremental improvements to Tesserae’s core software.</p>
<p>It will also be interesting to see how the TIS-API serves the growing movement within digital classics to provide better interoperability between collections and tools emerging from different projects within the field <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>. Such cross-project collaborations within digital classics hold much promise for enabling new modes of inquiry across well-known editions and newly digitized works.</p>
<p>Beyond digital classics, we hope the TIS-API will serve as a helpful point of comparison for other digital humanities projects. A future in digital humanities where larger questions can be answered through the aggregation of data from multiple sources will be more easily realized when individual projects provide an API to make their data more machine-accessible. The considerations made in the design and implementation of the TIS-API, including the adoption of REST principles and the analysis of Tesserae’s intertext discovery process, can serve as inspiration for other projects as they make decisions on how to design and implement their own APIs.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The TIS-API enables machine-accessibility of Tesserae intertext discovery capabilities. Machine-accessibility is achieved by following the software industry standards known as the REST principles, which encouraged thinking about Tesserae’s capabilities as resources and considering how to act upon those resources. In particular, the REST principles are evident in how Tesserae’s texts are made available, how stopwords are computed from Tesserae’s text collection, and how Tesserae search is implemented without saving application state either in the client or the server.</p>
<p>Making Tesserae machine-accessible yields two main benefits. First, it allows for parallelizing development efforts in the Tesserae software, as evidenced by the simultaneous development of both the TIS-API implementation and the new Tesserae website. The second benefit is in the promising possibilities for those not affiliated with the Tesserae project. Specifically, the ability to document search procedures exactly should lead to improved scholarly practices in computational literary criticism. We expect that other digital humanities projects can likewise reap benefits from upgrading their software with machine-accessibility.</p>
