Introduction</h2><p>The act of comparing textual versions has always been central to textual criticism and manuscript research. The importance of this type of collation has only increased in the digital age. Most scholarly editors no longer produce collations by hand; they use the output generated by software, either as is, or as the starting point for manual correction. Still, in more complex cases such as manuscripts with revisions – i.e., textual variation within one text version – it remains difficult to have the collation software produce a result that corresponds with what a scholarly editor would produce. The reason for this is, simply put, that the collation software treats the input as linear text, whereas text with revisions is not completely linear. As a consequence, scholarly editors still need to do quite some manual work, such as preparing the input texts or adjusting the collation output. What is more, they lose information about the multilayered nature of the document and the physical traces of the writing process or transmission history.</p><p>We therefore set out to create collation software that is able to compare texts with revisions. When working on this challenge, we soon realized that conveying our human interpretation of text with revisions to the computer is not merely a technical matter. It is, in fact, deeply rooted in philological questions: what do we understand by text with revisions? What type of revisions can we discern? And how do we expect the collation software to deal with them? Designing and developing a collation tool that understands in-text variation in a way similar to how scholarly editors understand it requires us to formalize our understanding of in-text variation. We argue that in-text variation can best be modelled as nonlinear text, and that a collation tool needs to treat this nonlinear text differently from the way linear text is treated. This will produce a more refined collation output that corresponds with a human interpretation of the textual variance.</p><p>For the purposes of this article, we focus on in-text variation resulting from authorial revisions on modern manuscripts; revisions by multiple textual agents are not within the scope of this article. As a test-corpus we took small examples from a modern manuscript of Samuel Beckett featuring numerous deletions and additions that Beckett made at various stages in the writing process.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> Evidently, the feature of in-text variation is not unique to modern manuscripts: medieval and older manuscripts often contain indistinguishable layers of in-text revisions as well. When in-text revisions are made with the same writing tool they cannot be easily divided into separate revision campaigns. The challenges of automatically collating such multi-layered texts are, then, twofold: first, to adequately process a textual version that contains one or more revisions, and second, to return a collation output that corresponds with what a scholarly editor would intuitively produce. We will discuss our approach to these challenges in the context of HyperCollate, an automatic collation tool developed to take in-text revisions into account when calculating the best match between two textual versions.</p><p><a href=#section2>Section 2</a> provides a theoretical background for the concepts and practices under discussion: versions, witnesses, in-text revision, and (non)linear text. It also provides a brief overview of the existing approaches to collating texts with in-text variation. <a href=#section3>Section 3</a> presents the collation tool HyperCollate. We describe its underlying data model – a hypergraph for textual variation – and how this data model differs from XML tree structures and regular variant graphs. A hypergraph for textual variation offers more flexibility in storing and processing information that is relevant to the study of textual variance. Subsequently, we single out two instances of in-text variation that occur frequently in manuscript texts – single deletions or additions and substitutions – and we describe for each type of variation what we, as human scholars, expect of the collation output (<a href=#section3-2>section 3.2</a>). How do we wantt the collation tool to handle immediate revisions in a textual version? What do we expect to see in the output? The answer to such questions, i.e., our expectations, inform the rules for the collation program. HyperCollate’s performance with each type of variation is discussed in <a href=#section3-3>section 3.3</a>. The evaluation (<a href=#section3-4>section 3.4</a>) includes the question of visualization, as existing visualizations could turn out to be inadequate in displaying the additional information in an insightful way. <a href=#section4>Section 4</a>, finally, discusses a number of areas in need of further research.</p><p>As the development and use of collation tools requires us to clearly articulate what we understand by textual variation and what we expect from the collation, automated collation tools can provide us with a heightened awareness of, and confront us with our assumptions about, the notion of text. The workflow of a scholarly editor using an automated collation tool consists of seemingly straightforward steps (transcription ⇒ collation ⇒ visualization) but each step implies decision-making at several stages and substages (selection, tagging, tokenization, normalization, a definition of a match, etc.). The decisions made at one stage influence the outcome of a subsequent stage. Recognizing and understanding this heuristic process will prompt us to rethink our theories of text (cf. <a href=#ciula2014>Ciula and Eide 2014, 36</a>) and how these theories correspond to the workings of a text analysis tool.</p><p>By demonstrating, first, how we made our human definition of in-text variation computer-understandable and, subsequently, how this definition influences the operations as well as the results of a collation tool, we hope to provide our readers with a deeper understanding of the process of modeling textual variation. We intend to show how the development of a collation program has both a philological and a computational perspective. Accordingly, our study reflects a fruitful collaboration between textual scholars and software architects: their respective knowledge is essential in order to successfully store, process, and analyse text. It thus proves a worthy partnership for manuscript research and modelling textual variance.</p><h2 id=2-theoretical-and-methodological-background>2. Theoretical and Methodological Background</h2><p>In what follows we give an overview of the discussion around textual versions and witnesses (section 2.1), of the challenges of transcribing and modeling in-text variation (section 2.2 and 2.3), and of the current approaches to collating texts with internal revisions (section 2.4).</p><h2 id=21-text-work-versions-witnesses-and-in-text-revision>2.1. Text, Work, Versions, Witnesses, and In-text Revision</h2><p>A few working definitions of the terms document, version, witness, work, and text are in order. Following Peter Shillingsburg, we define a document as the “physical vessel” that carries information <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. A version has “no substantial existence” as Shillingsburg puts it <sup id=fnref1:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. As a theoretical construct, it implies that there are at least two textual representations of the work. A witness is a “written document that witnesses a text’s genesis” according to Almuth Grésillon <sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> A witness is therefore a physical object. Whereas the term document considers the object in and of itself, the term witness considers it in relation to a work. Different documents that relate to the same work are witnesses of it. According to Siegfried Scheibe, “Textual versions are achieved or unachieved elaborations of the text that diverge from one another. They are related through textual identity and distinct through variation.” <sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>. In principle, this implies that a single revision suffices to speak of two versions, or as Hans Zeller noted: “In the most extreme case a version is constituted by a single variant. A holograph with one alteration which does not simply correct an error thus represents two versions of the text” <sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>. The notion of the work is used in the sense of the “experience implied by the authoritative versions of literary writing” <sup id=fnref2:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>, a non-material concept that “serves as a minimal denominator to identify its remaining physical manifestations” <sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>. In the context of this article, the term text will be employed to indicate not so much “the text of the work,” but “the text of the document,” that is, the sequence of marks present in one particular document <sup id=fnref1:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>.</p><p>In textual scholarship, the notion of version, textual version or Textfassung usually implies the entirety of a work, as in Peter Shillingsburg’s definition: “A version is one specific form of the work – the one the author intended at some particular moment in time” <sup id=fnref3:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. The problem, however, is that this moment in time is hard to define. If the work is a long novel, it takes a while for an author to revise the entire manuscript or to proofread the page proofs. The revision may consist of more than one phase, or more than one revision campaign (campagne de révision). There may be only two versions of the opening chapter, but a dozen versions of the closing chapter. Moreover, the unit of revision may vary considerably. Some writers’ preferred writing unit is a chapter, others tend to work and think in terms of paragraphs.</p><p>This reality makes it difficult to establish a general rule on which we can base the collation algorithm. For the purposes of this article, we work with the sentence as a relatively small unit of revision. Our examples are based on the manuscripts of Samuel Beckett and the transcriptions in the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP).<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup> These documents constitute what is usually referred to as “modern” manuscripts, to distinguish these autographs from ancient and medieval manuscripts, many of which were produced by scribes. Indeed the majority of medieval manuscripts are copies and not autographs, but that does not mean that all medieval manuscripts are copies. Medieval autographs do exist, and it is perfectly possible to apply automatic collation to them. Instead of using the term modern manuscripts we will therefore speak of manuscripts with revisions or even more generally of texts with revisions. In-text implies that we focus on textual variation within one version of a text.</p><h2 id=22-transcribing-linearity-and-nonlinearity>2.2. Transcribing Linearity and Nonlinearity</h2><p>As mentioned in the introduction, studying manuscripts with revisions is intrinsically linked to the act of linearizing text. Even when we read a text, we mentally arrange the characters in a linear order; vertically or horizontally, from left to right or vice versa, depending on the language. This perhaps subconscious act of linearization is more striking when we make a transcription of a complex text with revisions. Since the goal of a transcription is, in the first place, to render a text more readable, linearizing the text on the document is desirable – but not without cost. Texts with revisions contain traces of a writing process over time; so when words and characters are placed in a linear order, the manuscript page loses that diachronic aspect. The desire to preserve the nonlinear nature of the text coupled with the need to make it readable (and processable) confronts textual scholars with a dilemma. Accordingly, linearization has been the topic of long debates in genetic criticism and textual scholarship <sup id=fnref1:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup>. The flattening or de-manuscripting of a text is generally accepted as a necessary evil, although it is lamented that the most typical feature of a written draft – its nonlinearity – is reduced to a straightforward sequence of text.</p><p>In print, nonlinear text can be indicated with certain diacritical marks or forms of layout; in digital transcriptions the revisions can be captured with markup elements and visualized with HTML and/or CSS.<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup> The TEI Guidelines suggest two ways of expressing an instance of nonlinear text: substitutions can be recorded (1) by means of a <code>&lt;subst></code> element grouping one or more <code>&lt;del></code> and <code>&lt;add></code> elements,<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup> or (2) by means of an <code>&lt;app></code> element containing two or more <code>&lt;rdg></code> elements.<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup></p><p>In both cases, a human encoder will think of these TEI elements as indicating the momentary suspension of the linear sequence of text characters. The text stream runs from left to right, diverges at the points where variation occurs (indicated with an open tag <code>&lt;subst></code> or <code>&lt;app></code> ) and converges when the variation ends (indicated with a closing tag <code>&lt;/subst></code> or <code>&lt;/app></code> ). We can say that there are multiple coexisting, simultaneous paths through the text. The start of each path is marked with a <code>&lt;del></code> , an <code>&lt;add></code> , or a <code>&lt;rdg></code> element; the end of each path with the corresponding <code>&lt;/del></code> , <code>&lt;/add></code> , or <code>&lt;/rdg></code> . By coexisting we mean that the textual content of the <code>&lt;del></code> , <code>&lt;add></code> , or <code>&lt;rdg></code> is in the same location in the sentence. This corresponds with the TEI Guidelines’ remark that “Since the purpose of this [the <code>&lt;subst></code> ] element is solely to group its child elements together, the order in which they are presented is not significant.” <sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup></p><p>As described in <a href=#section2-4>section 2.4</a>, a current approach to the automated collation of in-text revisions is to flatten the TEI-XML transcription to a stream of plain text characters, thereby ignoring the TEI-XML markup elements that indicate nonlinear text. In order to fully understand the challenges that arise when we <em>do</em> wish to avoid flattening and instead take a text’s nonlinear features into account, we first need to take a closer look at how in-text revisions can be modelled in TEI-XML.</p><h2 id=23-modeling-nonlinearity>2.3. Modeling Nonlinearity</h2><p>A TEI-XML transcription of a straightforward text consists typically of fully ordered data. For textual scholars, the value and meaning of this data are primarily in the textual content, not in the TEI-XML elements. As a consequence, the order of the TEI-XML elements is meaningful. In the TEI-XML expert below, changing the order of the two <code>&lt;s></code> elements with their textual content would alter the meaning of the text:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=display:flex><span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;p&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;s&gt;</span>The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new.<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/s&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;s&gt;</span>Murphy sat out of it, as though he were free, in a mew in West Brompton.<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/s&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We have argued in the previous section that the textual data of a TEI-XML transcription of a manuscript with in-text revisions can be understood as an ordered stream of text characters, which splits into two or more paths when textual variation occurs. Or, put metaphorically by Michael Sperberg-McQueen, this type of text forms “curves that intersect, run together for a while, and then split apart again, like the channels in a river delta” <sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup>. By way of illustration, let’s take the following TEI-XML example:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=display:flex><span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;p&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;s&gt;</span>The <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;subst&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;del&gt;</span>quick<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/del&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;add&gt;</span>brown<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/add&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/subst&gt;</span> fox. <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/s&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The stream of textual data starts by being fully ordered with The. At the point in the text where variation occurs (marked with <code>&lt;subst></code> ), the stream splits into two paths that run parallel to one another. The textual data <em>within</em> the two <code>&lt;del></code> and <code>&lt;add></code> paths is again fully ordered as each path contains a linear stream of text characters. From a purely informational perspective, the deleted word quick is on the same level in the XML tree as the added word brown: they are both the textual content of the child elements of the <code>&lt;subst></code> element and they occur in the same place in the text. In other words, their position vis-à-vis their parent element is the same. At the end of the variation (marked with <code>&lt;/subst></code> ) the two paths converge again into one stream.</p><p>The order in which TEI-XML elements are placed also carries philological or semantic value. In the field of digital scholarly editing it is generally acknowledged that markup represents valuable editorial knowledge and that the tags reflect an interpretation of the inscriptions on the source document. Compare for instance</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=display:flex><span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;s&gt;</span>The <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;subst&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;del&gt;</span>quick<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/del&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;add&gt;</span>brown<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/add&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/subst&gt;</span> fox. <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/s&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=display:flex><span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;s&gt;</span>The <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;del&gt;</span>quick<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/del&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;add&gt;</span>brown<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/add&gt;</span> fox. <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/s&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the first case, the encoder groups together the deletion and the addition as part of one and the same revision. The elements <code>&lt;del></code> and <code>&lt;add></code> are in the same hierarchical location in the XML tree (again, both are children of the <code>&lt;subst></code> element).<sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup> In the second case, the deletion and the addition are interpreted as seperate interventions. The <code>&lt;del></code> element precedes the <code>&lt;add></code> element, which denotes a chronological order: first the word quick was deleted, then the word brown was added. In order for a collation tool to produce an output that corresponds with this interpretation of in-text revision, it should both recognize the start of parallel paths marked with <code>&lt;subst></code> or <code>&lt;app></code> / <code>&lt;rdg></code> , and take into account the chronological order implied by the order of the <code>&lt;del></code> and <code>&lt;add></code> tags without a <code>&lt;subst></code> or <code>&lt;app></code> parent.</p><h2 id=24-current-approaches-to-collating-in-text-revisions>2.4. Current Approaches to Collating In-text Revisions</h2><p>This section presents a concise discussion of the existing approaches to collating in-text revisions. We leave aside the manual collation method of TEI Parallel Segmentation and others and concentrate on the methods of automated collation.<sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup> As mentioned above, current automated collation tools are generally text-centered and do not handle TEI-XML well: they ignore all tags and attributes, or collate the elements as plain text. The nonlinear aspect of texts with revisions as described above, is ignored. If a scholar would want to automatically compare XML files, they could opt for (1) passing along information marked as relevant to the study of in-text variation (with CollateX, collation software; see <a href=#section2-4-1>section 2.4.1</a>), or (2) creating plain text files for each level of in-text variation (for instance with MVD, a storage format for text; see <a href=#section2-4-2>section 2.4.2</a>). As far as we know, both approaches are implemented by at least one edition project.</p><h2 id=241-passing-along-relevant-markup-elements>2.4.1. Passing Along Relevant Markup Elements</h2><p>The JSON input format of the collation tool CollateX allows for extra properties to be added to words <sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup>. A number of projects make use of the JSON input format to “pass along” additional information about relevant markup elements through the collation pipeline. In a pre-processing step, the text is tokenized and transformed into JSON word tokens. Editors make a selection of elements that they wish to attach to the JSON token as a <em>t</em> property (t for token). The collation is executed on the value of the token’s <em>n</em> property (n for normalized), but the <em>t</em> property with the tag(s) is included in the JSON alignment table output and can be processed in the table’s visualization. This approach is used, among others, by the aforementioned BDMP; the online critical edition of the Primary Chronicles, or <em>Povest’ vremennyx let</em> , created by David J. Birnbaum; and the work on the <em>Declamations</em> of Calpurnius Flaccus done by Elisa Nury <sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup> <sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup>. The advantages of this approach are, first, that a witness with in-text variation can be collated as one text and, secondly, that the method approximates the goal of having nonlinear revisions marked as such in both in- and output. The main disadvantage is that the collation algorithm still treats the input witness as linear text: the witnesses are collated as such and any information about revision campaigns is ignored during the collation process.</p><h2 id=242-creating-separate-plain-text-files-for-each-level-of-variation>2.4.2. Creating Separate Plain Text Files For Each Level of Variation</h2><p>Another approach is to transcribe a manuscript with in-text revisions as two or more separate plain text versions and then collate these temporary versions against each other. The advantage of this method is that it succeeds in aligning the two parts of a substitution vertically instead of horizontally (which the previous approach is forced to do), but the drawback is that the deletions and additions are spread over two or more (sub)versions. What is more, the revisions on a manuscript do not always lend themselves to a clean separation into different layers.</p><p>The approach is presented by Desmond Schmidt’s Multi-Version Document system, as integrated into Ecdosis, “A CMS for scholarly editors.” <sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup> In a 2019 article, Schmidt describes in detail how this layered approach also allows for the inclusion of in-text variation <sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup>. At the transcription phase, a manuscript text is divided into levels by the scholarly editor. All changes to the baseline text of a document (level 1) are grouped as being on level 2. Subsequent changes to level 2 are grouped as level 3. For each of these levels a separate text is created, a layer: “We do not claim that a layer is a text the author ever completed; it is not a <em>version</em> as such,” explains Schmidt, “It is simply a compact way to capture local changes.” <sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup> Each of these artificial layers is fed into Ecdosis as plain text, with a few additional features encoded in stand-off markup. The Ecdosis approach is implemented in the Charles Harpur Critical Archive. For example, the text of Harpur’s poem “To the Comet” is divided into three layers. The document identifier english/harpur/poems/h595f/layer-2 points to the second layer of the poem’s text. Layer 2 is followed by h595f/layer-final, in which corrections on the third level are carried out on the text of layer 2.<sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup> The scholarly editors of the Charles Harpur Critical Archive see no issue in this mechanical grouping of in-text variation:</p><blockquote><p>Assignment to levels is mechanical and describes a purely local succession of changes, which can almost always be determined. Authors leave many clues as to the succession of variants: position (above the line, then below, in the margin, on another page), the carrying over of changed text between levels, sense and crossing-out. Where the local temporal succession can’t be established this is usually because the corrections themselves can’t be read.<br><a href="https://charles-harpur.org/View/Singleview/?docid=english/harpur/poems/h595&amp;version1=/h595f/layer-final">( <em>Ibid</em> .)</a> The versions and layers in plain text are merged into one Multi-Version Document. It stores the text shared by each version and layer only once. Note that the comparison algorithm works at the character level, not at word level. In the table visualization, therefore, words may be cut up (see <a href=#figure01>figure 1</a>).</p></blockquote><figure><img loading=lazy alt src=/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure01.png sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure01_hua73d0507cdaca88483a18bccebed2ebf_43785_500x0_resize_box_3.png 500w,

Diff Algorithms to Compare XML Documents</h2><p>Evidently, XML is a widely used standard for (online) publishing and data-exchange, and there is a general need for comparing and versioning XML documents. Accordingly, there exists a wide variety of diff algorithms or deltas to find the differences between two XML documents, each with its own strengths and focus <sup id=fnref:27><a href=#fn:27 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>27</a></sup>. Because most XML documents are data-centric and contain record-based data, deltas typically consider XML documents as hierarchically structured trees and compare them as such. Considering our type of material – text-centric XML documents in which the left-to-right order of the siblings is significant – we specifically focused on tools that can compare ordered XML trees.</p><p>We found a number of useful tools and algorithms, like the commercial tools Microsoft’s XML Diff and Patch or the XML compare tool of DeltaXML, that can compare both ordered and unordered XML trees.<sup id=fnref:28><a href=#fn:28 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>28</a></sup> Such tools can come in handy during the making of a digital edition, for instance when scholarly editors wish to compare and align TEI-XML transcriptions of the same text that were made by two different scholars of the same project. Furthermore, there exist XML editors with a built-in function to compare XML documents. Oxygen XML Editor, for example, allows its users to compare two XML documents on the level of lines, words, or characters, or to ignore attributes or namespaces.<sup id=fnref:29><a href=#fn:29 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>29</a></sup></p><p>There is, however, an important difference between current XML comparison tools and algorithms, and how we designed HyperCollate. Existing tools compare XML documents and focus on the parent nodes, whereas HyperCollate <em>interprets</em> XML documents in order to better compare the versions of a text. It does not ignore the structure of the XML tree, but – in line with the research objectives of scholarly editors – it focuses on comparing text and is only concerned with the TEI-XML tags that determine the flow of a text with revisions. Given this fundamental difference in premise, an extensive analysis of the quality and use of diff algorithms and tools is beyond the scope of this article.<sup id=fnref:30><a href=#fn:30 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>30</a></sup></p><h2 id=3-automated-collation-of-nonlinear-text>3. Automated Collation of Nonlinear Text</h2><h2 id=31-nonlinearity-and-variant-graphs>3.1. Nonlinearity and Variant Graphs</h2><p>As the previous section showed, automated collation software usually does not take in-text revisions into account. Yet we find that texts with revisions have a complex richness that deserves to be treated with attention to detail, in transcription as well as in collation, so as to produce a more accurate and detailed record of the textual variance. The collation result of HyperCollate needed to correspond with the scholarly editor’s interpretation of the in-text variance, which meant that the tool should be able to recognize and respect the nonlinear nature of the input text as it was expressed in TEI-XML markup.</p><p>The first step we took in enabling a collation tool to recognize in-text variation in a witness was establishing formal (i.e., exhaustive and unambiguous) rules for the way in which the program needed to process it. As described in <a href=#section2-2>section 2.2</a>, we regard a revision as a temporary interruption in the linear text stream, so we wanted HyperCollate to be able to treat it as such. In order for this to work, the collation tool would have to recognize and interpret the markup elements indicating the start and end of nonlinearity in the TEI-XML input transcription: <code>&lt;app></code> and <code>&lt;subst></code> . Secondly, we regard the elements <code>&lt;del></code> , <code>&lt;add></code> , or <code>&lt;rdg></code> as indicators of the start of a separate path through the text – one branch of the text stream – and we would want the collation program to select the best match from these branches.</p><p>A fitting model of nonlinear text is presented by the variant graph data structure. The variant graph consists of a set of nodes that represent textual objects, and edges that connect one node to another node in the graph. The graphs are acyclic, which means that they are read from left to right without looping back. As Tara Andrews and Caroline Macé write, a variant graph is an elegant way to represent nonlinear text: “one may imagine a text running from beginning to end with a number of points of divergence, where each witness takes a single path through these divergences” <sup id=fnref:31><a href=#fn:31 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>31</a></sup>. Variant graphs are relatively well-known in the field of automated collation and occur both as internal data model <sup id=fnref:32><a href=#fn:32 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>32</a></sup> <sup id=fnref1:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup> and for visualization purposes (e.g., the stemma graph or the variant graph, <sup id=fnref1:31><a href=#fn:31 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>31</a></sup>). As Elisa Nury writes, the first use of a variant graph to express textual variation can be traced to E.C. Colwell and E.W. Tune in 1964, although it was with the 2009 article of Desmond Schmidt and Robert Colomb that the variant graph gained a foothold in the field of textual scholarship <sup id=fnref1:32><a href=#fn:32 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>32</a></sup> (See <sup id=fnref1:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup>). Their variant graph has the text and sigla placed on the edges of the graph (<a href=#figure02>figure 2</a>). Common text is merged, and variant text results in separate branches.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src=/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure02.png sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure02_hu7246f9a3ca41f86c776c27c7adfdce68_15688_500x0_resize_box_3.png 500w,

This ensures not only a better readability, but also improves processing as the edges have only one label (one or more sigla).</p><p>There is another, more subtle yet important distinction between the variant graph as proposed by Schmidt and Colomb, and the variant graph as implemented by CollateX. The data structure of the variant graph in figure 3 appears simpler than it is. At first glance, the textual content of the first node (The) appears to be shared by witness 1 (W1) and witness 2 (W2). In fact, each node in the CollateX variant graph represents <em>a set of text tokens</em> that originate from one or more versions; the tokens in a set are considered equal by the CollateX collation algorithm. The main point being that the tokens are not modeled on textual content, as is the case with the variant graph of Schmidt and Colomb. In CollateX’s variant graph model, arbitrary tokens can be compared and their correspondences, differences, and order can be represented in a variant graph structure <sup id=fnref2:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup>. This seemingly small feature paves the way for HyperCollate’s approach to collation.</p><figure><img loading=lazy alt src=/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure03.png sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure03_hu31a5c61542e86999dae1ec17e5dee88f_27380_500x0_resize_box_3.png 500w,

Text that is considered as a match shares a node.</p></figcaption></figure><p>HyperCollate uses a <em>hypergraph for textual variation</em> . This data structure is more flexible than trees, and it differs from regular variant graphs in that it has <em>hyperedges</em> which can connect multiple nodes to one another. As a result, the nodes of a hypergraph can be traversed in more than one order. Finally, the hypergraph data model of HyperCollate contains text nodes as well as markup nodes. This means that the markup node of, say, a <code>&lt;del></code> element can be connected to multiple text nodes which do not immediately have to follow one another. As a result, it is possible to express multiple, overlapping or nonlinear dimensions of a text in markup.<sup id=fnref:33><a href=#fn:33 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>33</a></sup> Moreover, the hypergraph also enables the representation of individual witnesses with in-text variance as a hypergraph (see <a href=#figure04>figure 4</a>).</p><p>HyperCollate is trained on the two ways of encoding in-text revisions as proposed by the TEI and discussed in section 2.2: it acts whenever it encounters either a <code>&lt;subst></code> , an <code>&lt;app></code> , or their children <code>&lt;del></code> , <code>&lt;add></code> , or <code>&lt;rdg></code> . These TEI-XML elements are interpreted as instances of nonlinear text, with the opening tags marking a break in the linear sequence of the text characters, and the closing tags identifying the return to linearity. Let&rsquo;s take for Witness 1 the same example of a simple TEI-XML transcription we used above:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=display:flex><span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;s&gt;</span>The <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;subst&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;del&gt;</span>quick<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/del&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;add&gt;</span>brown<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/add&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/subst&gt;</span> fox. <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/s&gt;</span>

First, the TEI-XML transcribed texts (here XML witness 1 and XML witness 2) are transformed into individual variant hypergraphs. These variant hypergraphs are subsequently segmented and the resulting tokens are aligned. The alignment is carried out on the level of the text; the markup elements <code>&lt;app></code> and <code>&lt;subst></code> are recognized as occurrences of nonlinearity. Subsequently, the resulting set of matches are merged with the two individual hypergraph witnesses. The result of the collation is a collation hypergraph in which all text nodes that are not aligned are unique to one of the two hypergraph witnesses, and all the text nodes that are aligned are reduced to one node. There are labels on the edges indicating which node is part of which hypergraph. For every witness, then, there is always a fully connected path through the hypergraph from the start text node to the end text node, following the sigils on the edges. The collation hypergraph can be visualized or exported in alignment table format, SVG, PNG, or dot format. If there are more than two witnesses, the result of that first collation can be used as the basis of a new collation, following the method of progressive alignment.<sup id=fnref:34><a href=#fn:34 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>34</a></sup></p><p>HyperCollate does not regard the input TEI-XML files as plain text files (which would result in the aforementioned flattening of the input text): instead, each input witness is transformed into a hypergraph and these individual witness hypergraphs are subsequently collated against each other. In short, HyperCollate can compare TEI-XML files with in-text revisions without having to convert them to a plain text character string. During the alignment, HyperCollate looks at all branches within each witness hypergraph. If the textual content of one branch (the start of which is indicated by a <code>&lt;del></code> , <code>&lt;add></code> , or an <code>&lt;rdg></code> open tag) has a match in the other witness, the text is aligned; if not, the text remains in a separate branch in the hypergraph.</p><p>Furthermore, the tag names ( <code>&lt;del></code> , <code>&lt;add></code> , <code>&lt;rdg></code> , <code>&lt;subst></code> , and <code>&lt;app></code> ) are not only interpreted but preserved as well, in order to enable further querying, transformation or visualization of the collation result. The visualization of the information-rich collation hypergraph opens up new possibilities and new questions. For example, if we visualize the collation output as a variant graph, should we distinguish the paths that represent variation within one witness from the paths constituted by variation between different witnesses, and if so: how?</p><p>As shown in section 3.3.3, <a href=#figure20>figure 20</a>, we have currently opted for placing extra marks on the edges of the visualization of the collation graph, right after the witness sigil: a minus [-] for an in-text deletion and a plus [+] for an in-text addition. In case of an in-text substitution within a substitution, this will lead to a sequence of multiple [+][-] which may not lead to a clear visualization. Of course, we can say that at this point the source manuscript text also presents a complex case of revision and this complexity is merely reflected in the collation output. Nevertheless, visualizing the collation produced by HyperCollate remains an interesting challenge (see also <sup id=fnref:35><a href=#fn:35 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>35</a></sup>).</p><h2 id=321-deletions-and-additions>3.2.1 Deletions and Additions</h2><p>Consider the example in <a href=#figure07>figure 7</a>, transcribed first with the TEI <code>&lt;del></code> / <code>&lt;add></code> method, and then with the TEI <code>&lt;app></code> / <code>&lt;rdg></code> method.<br><figure><img loading=lazy alt src=/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure07.png sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure07_hu8aec5ee9d1d408af166c52756522d200_67924_500x0_resize_box_3.png 500w,

Moreover, since not all text encoders group <code>&lt;del></code> and <code>&lt;add></code> elements within a <code>&lt;subst></code> tag (see <a href=#section2-3>section 2.3.</a>, HyperCollate should differentiate between a substitution and an unconnected deletion and addition by providing clear rules on how to trigger its special treatment of substitutions for transcriptions that don’t include <code>&lt;subst></code> elements. For now, HyperCollate implements a heuristic: if a <code>&lt;del></code> element is directly followed by an <code>&lt;add></code> element, unspaced, we take them as belonging together, so the heuristic places a <code>&lt;subst></code> around the two. If the <code>&lt;del></code> and <code>&lt;add></code> elements are separated by a white space, they are not grouped together, and treated in a linear way. Of course, as with all heuristics, this is not an optimal solution, as some scholarly editors do use a white space between a <code>&lt;del></code> and an <code>&lt;add></code> element, even if they consider them to belong to the same substitution.</p><p>The <code>&lt;subst></code> or <code>&lt;app></code> element demarcates the beginning of a split in HyperCollate’s token stream. From that point on there are two substreams: one substream with the <code>&lt;del></code> or first <code>&lt;rdg></code> element and its textual content, and one substream with the <code>&lt;add></code> or second <code>&lt;rdg></code> element and its textual content. The <code>&lt;del></code> , <code>&lt;add></code> , and <code>&lt;rdg></code> elements are unordered: they are at the same distance gromfthe root node <code>&lt;xml></code> .</p><p>A <code>&lt;subst></code> element can contain more than one <code>&lt;del></code> and more than one <code>&lt;add></code> element. In principle each <code>&lt;del></code> and <code>&lt;add></code> represents a new branch.

The differences in alignment stem from a difference in focus: does the scholarly editor want to give priority to the unit of the substitution, or should the alignment of matching words receive priority? The traditional approach in collation of starting from exact string matches and grouping the variants in columns between the matches has the advantage of accentuating the similarities between witnesses, but the unit of the substitution can become obscured as it is spread over multiple columns. Holding the substitution together in the alignment, on the other hand, keeps the focus on the nonlinear nature of manuscripts as witnesses. It marks the spot where something happens on the manuscript and the totality of a textual operation is presented as one block. The drawback is a potential loss of information if the occurrence of a matching word across witnesses is not indicated in the collation output.</p><p>Consider the examples below.<br><figure><img loading=lazy alt src=/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure15.png sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 80vw" srcset="/dhqwords/vol/16/1/000583/resources/images/figure15_huec99af8b1f92285cd8498c9c6b827880_34648_500x0_resize_box_3.png 500w,

Future Work</h2><p>At the moment of writing, HyperCollate can already be used via Github or in a Kotlin notebook.<sup id=fnref:36><a href=#fn:36 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>36</a></sup> The collation tool is still in a prototype state and we can identify several areas of further development. On the one hand, these developments regard the tool’s functionalities, such as generating different output formats and collating witnesses regardless of the order in which they are inputted (order independent collation). At the moment, we use the progressive alignment method, which means that the order in which the witnesses are fed to the collation program influences the outcome. Evidently, we do not want the order in which the witnesses are inputted to affect the collation output, but this is a computationally highly complex issue for which as of yet no clear-cut solution has been found.</p><p>Another area of future work is more philological, concerning questions such as How should HyperCollate handle open variants? and Can we include other types of markup in the collation? In the following paragraphs, we will briefly expand on these and other questions.</p><h2 id=41-output-formats>4.1. Output Formats</h2><p>The output of collation software is often used as the basis for further processing or editorial correction. It is therefore important to offer a myriad of options that can be edited afterwards. HyperCollate can currently output collations either as a hypergraph (expressed in SVG, dot, PNG formats) or as an alignment table in ASCII. An HTML implementation of a comparable table format is in development.</p><p>We are also working on output expressed in XML. With the encoding schema we hope to stay as close to the TEI parallel segmentation method as possible. As a starting point we envisage the following:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=display:flex><span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;app&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;rdg</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>wit=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;#A-&#34;</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>type=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;deletion&#34;</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>varSeq=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;1&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;del&gt;</span>Alice<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/del&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/rdg&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;rdgGrp</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>type=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;tag_variation_only&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;rdg</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>wit=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;#A+&#34;</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>type=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;addition&#34;</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>varSeq=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;2&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;add&gt;</span>Cathleen<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/add&gt;&lt;/rdg&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;rdg</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>wit=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;#B&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>&gt;</span>Cathleen<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/rdg&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/rdgGrp&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/app&gt;</span> came.

As the XML counterpart of a node in the graph where the witnesses have the same text but a different XML context, they are placed as separate readings in a reading group ( <code>&lt;rdgGrp></code> ). The element has a @type attribute with the value tag_variantion_only to indicate that the readings only differ in the level of the XML elements.

Currently this encoding produces three separate tokens: Scratc, g and h, none of which will be aligned with the occurrence of Scratch in another version. This is a very challenging problem for any collation algorithm, because it creates the need for an alignment within an alignment: aligning words in a first step and characters subsequently.</p><p>There are a few avenues of development to consider.

Finally, using the <code>&lt;app></code> / <code>&lt;rdg></code> transcription method, a construction with an extra reading, <code>&lt;rdg type="lit"></code> ,<sup id=fnref:38><a href=#fn:38 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>38</a></sup> might be considered:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-xml data-lang=xml><span style=display:flex><span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;app&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;rdg</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>wit=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;A&#34;</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>varSeq=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;1&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>&gt;</span>Scratcg<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/rdg&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;rdg</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>wit=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;B&#34;</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>varSeq=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;2&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>&gt;</span>Scratch<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/rdg&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;rdg</span> <span style=color:#a6e22e>type=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;lit&#34;</span><span style=color:#f92672>&gt;</span>Scratc<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;del&gt;</span>g<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/del&gt;&lt;add&gt;</span>h<span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/add&gt;&lt;/rdg&gt;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;/app&gt;</span>.

The TEI guidelines suggest that open variants should be encoded with a <code>&lt;seg></code> element around the inline part of the open variant, followed by one or more <code>&lt;add></code> elements. For HyperCollate to apply the same treatment to open variants as to substitutions, it will need to recognize a <code>&lt;seg></code> element and treat it in a similar way to <code>&lt;del></code> or <code>&lt;add></code> . Because the <code>&lt;seg></code> is a general element with several uses, HyperCollate will have to look for a <code>&lt;seg></code> element with a @type attribute with the value alternative.</p><h2 id=44-transpositions>4.4.

Transposition metamarks, however, do not violate the linearity of the text, as the text fragment does not have two alternatives for one word or phrase, but merely suggests a reordering of two or more words. A special treatment by HyperCollate of this textual feature is not needed to provide a meaningful result. Currently, the source XML is handled by HyperCollate linearly like all other material. The actual word order is collated, and the second, implied order can still be deduced from the markup in the transcription.

Conclusion</h2><p>In-text variation is essential for the study of textual variance and the TEI Guidelines offer several ways to encode this kind of information. Consequently, the need to include the information in the automatic collation of manuscript texts is apparent. Up to now, including in-text variation was only possible through workarounds that either require significant coding skills from the users – passing along markup tags as shadow-tokens on the JSON input of CollateX – or by manually creating pseudo-versions from the layers of in-text variation and treating them as regular versions. These approaches do ensure that information about the in-text variation is present in the collation output so that the nonlinear features of the individual witnesses can be visually reconstructed. However, the information is not part of the alignment process itself: the collation tools treat the input texts as a linear, ordered stream of characters and thus ignore the multilayered character of manuscript text.</p><p>In this paper, we argued that in-text variation provides meaningful information about the temporality of the writing process. We demonstrated that this type of variation constitutes nonlinear, partially ordered data and we argued that it should be treated as such by collation software. We therefore set out to develop a collation program, HyperCollate, that understands each witness as a stream of text tokens that splits into two or more branches at the point where the internal variation occurs and converges at the end of the variation. The occurrences of variation are marked by the scholarly editor with designated TEI-XML tags. HyperCollate thus produces a collation output that represents the multidimensional nature of the source text more adequately and thus corresponds with how the in-text variation was conceptualized and encoded.</p><p>The paper began with a description of our understanding of different types of in-text variation, and subsequently illustrated how that understanding translates logically. We then illustrated how the input of HyperCollate, TEI-XML transcriptions, are transformed into individual witness hypergraphs with partially ordered textual data. HyperCollate compares two witness hypergraphs and finds the best match between the branches of text. In case of more witnesses, HyperCollate compares them progressively. Accordingly, the TEI-XML transcriptions that hold so much scholarly information can be used as direct input without any need for pre-processing or flattening. We concluded that including the in-text variation produces a more refined output that more accurately represents the textual variation as interpreted by the scholarly editor during the transcription phase.</p><p>One interesting finding is that in case of a longer substitution, the best way to collate versions with in-text variation depends on the preference of the scholarly editor. They can either prefer to have the collation program align on the unit of substitution, or to align on the individual words within the substitution. Future users of HyperCollate will be able to indicate their preference in the collation command. We also found that the visualization of HyperCollate’s in- and output may depend on the user’s preference. Both the input (a witness hypergraph) and the output (a collation hypergraph) of HyperCollate can be visualized as variant hypergraphs with or without markup nodes as colored hyperedges.</p><p>The visualizations are an attempt to provide more insight into the text and its revisions, but visualizing such a complex data structure is quite challenging. The output of HyperCollate simply contains a lot of information, and it is difficult to visualize all that information in a clear and insightful way. This becomes evident with the alignment table visualization: the alignment table allows scholarly editors to see at a glance which words are added and deleted, but at the same time using the [-] and [+] signs for in-text deletions and additions simplify the revision process. Still, an alignment table is generally easier to read than a collation hypergraph, and so far user-testing has shown that the alignment table does feel intuitive to scholarly editors. We will continue to experiment with the visualizations of the collation hypergraph, e.g., by adding [-] and [+] signs on the edges of the collation hypergraph or by using thicker edges if a token is present in many versions.</p><p>In conclusion, this article aimed to show how formalizing our understanding of in-text variation as nonlinear, partially ordered text can help to communicate our human understanding to a collation tool. We trained HyperCollate on two TEI encoding suggestions for in-text variation, app/rdg and subst/del/add, in order to illustrate that the formalization can work for different encoding styles. The larger argument made in this article concerns the benefits of reflecting upon our textual models and to what extent they impact our encoding models and subsequently the in- and output of text analysis tools.</p><p>The development of HyperCollate was propelled by a knowledge exchange between textual scholars and research software engineers. This exchange took the form of long discussions, much prototyping, experimenting, and testing. Realizing the value of our collaboration and ongoing knowledge exchange, we have tried to be transparent about our methodology and detailed our textual theories and expectations of the software as well as the decision making process of HyperCollate. Indeed, we found collaborating on the development of a collation program an insightful, iterative learning process that emphasizes the benefits of including computational methods in manuscript research.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>The examples selected for this article are small for illustrative purposes, but HyperCollate is developed to deal with larger texts.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>Shillingsburg, Peter. 1996. <em>Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age: Theory and Practice</em> (3rd Edition).
