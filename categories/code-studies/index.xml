Along with his colleague Thomas Kurtz and a few work-study students at Dartmouth College, Kemeny had developed the BASIC programming language and Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS), both of which went live on May 1, 1964. BASIC and DTSS represented perhaps the earliest successful attempt at programming for all, combining English-language vocabulary (e.g.,
HELLO instead of
LOGON ), simple yet robust instructions, and near-realtime access to a mainframe computer.</description></item><item><title>Computational art Explorations of Linguistic Possibility Spaces: comparative translingual close readings of Daniel C.

Howe. Automatype , 2012-16, is, in the words of the artist’s description, “a networked installation (composed of analog TV monitors and RaspberryPIs running custom software) that explores the creation of aesthetic, linguistic meaning via anticipation, juxtaposition, and association. The algorithm at the heart of the work continually computes the minimum number of substitutions required to transform each valid English word into the next, deriving a near infinite number of combinations of words and phrases, letter-by-letter, substitution-by-substitution.</description></item><item><title>Nonsense Code: A Nonmaterial Performance</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000702/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Barry Rountree, William Condee</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000702/</guid><description>1. Happy Birthday, Nonsense, and Nonmaterial Performance Note that programming the UNIVAC 1 is done with pencil, paper, and flow charts.[^sperryrand1959] Assembly language instructions for the UNIVAC 1.[^koss2003] Consider a somewhat mysterious computer tape from the early 1950s that was run a handful of times each year on Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL) UNIVAC 1 computer. The code is easy enough to describe. Single instructions are repeated thousands of times, but the results of those instructions are discarded.</description></item><item><title>Poetry as Code as Interactive Fiction: Engaging Multiple Text-Based Literacies in Scarlet Portrait Parlor</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000693/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Jason Boyd</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000693/</guid><description>One of the goals of Mark C. Marino’s Critical Code Studies is to persuade humanities scholars that the code that operates around us everywhere in our daily lives — mundane, but life-shaping code — is an interesting, important, and intellectually rewarding focus of inquiry in the humanities: as Marino observes, this class of computer code demands humanistic study because it constitutes “an ideology that is doubly hidden by our illiteracy and by the very screens on which its output delights and distracts” 1.</description></item><item><title>Reverse Engineering the Gendered Design of Amazon’s Alexa: Methods in Testing Closed-Source Code in Grey and Black Box Systems</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000700/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Lai-Tze Fan</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000700/</guid><description>30 years ago these sayings were cliché, today they are offenisve [sic]. Demeaning, limiting, or belittling a woman’s contribution to a household is not quaint or cute. Prolonging or promoting sexists tropes is wrong. Maybe write a skill called Sexist Spouse. Please do better humans.

This article examines the gendered design of Amazon Alexa’s voice-driven capabilities, or, skills, in order to better understand how Alexa, as an AI assistant, mirrors traditionally feminized labour and sociocultural expectations.</description></item><item><title>ᐊᒐᐦᑭᐯᐦᐃᑲᓇ ᒫᒥᑐᓀᔨᐦᐃᒋᑲᓂᐦᑳᓂᕽ | acahkipehikana mâmitoneyihicikanihkânihk | Programming with Cree# and Ancestral Code: Nehiyawewin Spirit Markings in an Artificial Brain</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000699/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Jon Corbett</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000699/</guid><description>Introduction Nohkompan,1 my paternal grandmother, was Nehiyaw (Cree) and Saulteaux (Chippewa). After her passing and understanding the matriarchal nature of many Cree peoples, I found myself looking at the Nehiyaw culture of her mother, Nitâpân ,2 for inspiration for my creative works. In 2014, I attempted to use Nehiyawewin (the Cree language) words as variables using the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics 3. My early attempts were instantly problematic because the development environments (IDEs) I used would render the syllabics, like ᑖ, as empty boxes ⌧.</description></item><item><title>The Politics of Tools</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000690/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Stephen Ramsay</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000690/</guid><description>Zilu said, If the ruler of Wei were to entrust you with governance of his state, what would be your first priority? The Master said, Most certainly, it would be to rectify names.
Confucius, Analects To speak of the politics of tools is to take the political nature of technology for granted, and rightfully so. If the generation of historians, literary critics, sociolinguistis, and philosophers who came up in the academy after Foucault are united by anything, it is the idea that most things are wrapped up in issues of power, and therefore cannot be said to stand outside the realm of the political in any way.</description></item><item><title>How to Do Things with Deep Learning Code</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000684/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Minh Hua, Rita Raley</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000684/</guid><description>Screen capture from This Word Does Not Exist 1. Overview The public conversation about large language models is nothing if not riddled with sensation. Even apart from OpenAI’s already-notorious ChatGPT, or a Google engineer’s claim of sentience for its conversational model, the reporting on research advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) almost inevitably cultivates some degree of alarm and auratic mystery. Some of this affect is generalizable to the field of artificial intelligence, which continues to be overcoded as a dangerous and impenetrable black box.</description></item></channel></rss>
