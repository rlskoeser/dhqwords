By infrastructure , I mean the full suite of social and technological systems that converge in DH and the work of memory institutions: platforms and tools, certainly; but also systems of selection, arrangement, and description of cultural materials deemed worthy of attention — and the practices that shape those decisions at scale, distributing or reifying authority, security, and privilege.</description></item><item><title>Archives, Information Infrastructure, and Maintenance Work</title><link>https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/vol/16/1/000603/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Ciaran B.

[edwards2003] The task for scholars of infrastructure, then, is not merely to dwell on the materiality of infrastructure — an important topic on its own right, to be sure — but to dig deeper and uncover the humans who keep things going .
[fidler2018] Built over centuries, the scholarly infrastructure that forms the backbone of the humanities includes “diverse collections of primary sources in libraries, archives, and museums; the bibliographies, searching aids, citation systems, and concordances that make that information retrievable; the standards that are embodied in cataloging and classification systems; the journals and university presses that distribute the information; and the editors, librarians, archivists, and curators who link the operation of this structure to the scholars who use it” [unsworth2006] .</description></item></channel></rss>
