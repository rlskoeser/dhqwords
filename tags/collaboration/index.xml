In his explanation of the visionary aspects of the digital humanities, Patrik Svensson [svensson2012] suggests that the interdisciplinarity of the discipline disrupts traditional academic structures. Supporting digital humanities efforts requires an organizational and budgetary structure that universities, siloed into academic departments, are not equipped to support. The academic library, however, transcends some of these traditional boundaries and can be a setting for digital humanities encounters.</description></item></channel></rss>
