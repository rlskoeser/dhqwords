Introduction1 Many and diverse scientific communities, including digital textual scholars, have shown increasing interest in semantic web technologies and linked open data (LOD) as a means of knowledge representation since the early 2000s, when Tim Berners-Lee coined the concept of a web of interconnected data rather than simply documents (see#spadini2021). Nonetheless, there is a lack of user-friendly tools for working with digital scholarly editions and LOD.

In it he gave some examples of how open data fromgovernments, scientists and institutionscould be used to make significant statements about the state of affairs in society. He then asked governments, scientists and institutions to support this kind of work by making more of their data freely available in a form where it could be further processed rather than just looked at.</description></item></channel></rss>
