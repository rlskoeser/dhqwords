The basic stylometric assumption is that each writer has a “human stylome” 1, that is a set of certain stylistic idiosyncrasies that define their style. Analysis based on stylometry is often used for Authorship Attribution (AA) tasks, since the main idea behind computationally supported AA is that by measuring some textual features, it is possible to distinguish between texts written by different authors 2.</description></item></channel></rss>
