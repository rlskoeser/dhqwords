Berry</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000706/</guid><description>Introduction In the past decade, due to the perceived lack of accountability of algorithmic systems, particularly automated decision systems, a new explanatory demand has crystallized in an important critique of computational opaqueness and new forms of technical transparency called explainability. We see this, for example, in challenges to facial recognition technologies, public unease with algorithmic judicial systems and other automated decision systems. There have been new regulatory attempts to capture some of the ideas that stem from explainability such as the Algorithmic Accountability Act 2022 in the US, and the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) in the European Union.</description></item><item><title>Introduction: Situating Critical Code Studies in the Digital Humanities</title><link>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000713/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Mark C. Marino, Jeremy Douglass</author><guid>https://rlskoeser.github.io/dhqwords/vol/17/2/000713/</guid><description>Almost two decades ago, at the start of Critical Code Studies (CCS), we asked two provocative questions: “What does computer source code mean ?” and “What do we discover when we read code with the interpretive tools of the humanities?”
At the 2006 MLA Convention in Philadelphia 1 where we launched the manifesto, some humanities scholars in the audience asked whether reading code was a conversation better suited for a technology conference.</description></item></channel></rss>
